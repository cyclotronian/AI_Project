Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
You have my word.  As a gentleman
How do you get your hair to look like that?
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
It's more
Neat...
You are so completely unbalanced.
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
Daddy, I --
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
He always have that shit-eating grin?
You know French?
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
What makes you think he'll do it?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
Will Bogey get bent?
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
What'd you do to her?
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
It's about time.
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
Hey.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
Who's that?
William - he asked me to meet him here.
You hate me don't you?
Why'd you let him get to you?
I thought you were above all that
No, you weren't
I heard there was a poetry reading.
The Partridge Family?
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
Tell me something true.
No, I won't go with you
Answer the question, Patrick
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
Which parts?
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
You were right. She's still pissed.
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
We should have seen land.
I could be gone for years.
God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
They took everything...
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
Viceroy of the West Indies.
I want to go with you!
And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
All I have to do is call the guards.
Chief says -- how many?
We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?
Utapan, won't you speak to me?  You used to know how to speak to me.
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
How long?
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
I believed in you...
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
But without your brothers.  Nor are you to return to Santo Domingo or any of the other colonies.  You may explore the continent.
We can't raise the wheel without it.
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
Don't say anything.
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
I will if they don't send me back.
Are you married?
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
I'm gonna propose.
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
Any I.D.?
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
Nah, I musta missed it.
Hmmmm.
What would you call her?
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
I'll come with you.
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
My folks are.
Two heads.
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
Stop it.
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?
Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
Where's your partner?
Please join us.  Come on forward.
We are both from Prague.
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
Turn that fucking thing off!
Speak English!
What is it?
I'm serious.
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.
Viewer discretion advised!
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
Well, he killed my partner!
I'll send a cop back for you.
Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!
What are you gonna do?
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
I suppose the idea was specialized training.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
You're kidding.
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
Well, don't worry about it.
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
I suppose it's because you've been under a lot of stress, but have you forgotten that they're not supposed to be revived for another three months.
I am prepared to do that anyway.
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
Are you coming to my party?
When are you coming home?
Where is Mrs. Brown?
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
Oh, thank you very much.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
Any ideas about the colour?
I see.
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?
Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
This is three years old.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
I don't give a damn about his girl...
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
What's the matter with my place?
Hello, again.
Here you go, baby.
You lying son of a bitch...
I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.
Yeah, I noticed...
No way to start a partnership.
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge...
Hey, you wanna bet?
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
Let's go.
This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.
You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
No class...
We missed.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the "Don't Disturb" sign.  He's trading his girl for the money.  All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.
Why?
Hey, how'd my car get here?
What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.
Hey, there she is...
Yeah...
What the bell happened?
What a screw-up.
That's what you say, Cates...
You look awful.
Bullshit red tape.
I got to wait for a call.
I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
No wonder you're so popular.
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
How do you know?
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
Three more hours...
Who the hell are you?
Hey, two days with him is enough.
Stall.
Let her go.
How you doing, man?
You want to go outside?
Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.
The case..with the stones... Where is it?
Why?  What's wrong with me?
He's a she!
We have to save the world.
It's a miracle!!!
They really made her...
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
I don't have time... I need to know.
Yeah?
Uh... at least fifty.
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
Hi Ma...
Other than that... You all right?
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
Yeah?
...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
I'm not going.
It's my wife.
Love...
You noticed..
It's up to you now, Angel!
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
The cash man!
It's not?
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
Staedert, do you read me?
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
...Not far, now.
I'm not accusing you...
Okay, I believe you.
How's the detective business?
I love you.
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
You should have.
You're killing me...
Who are you calling?
What the fuck... !
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
I want to watch you work.
I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.
You brought the money?
Excellent.
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.
Friend of yours?
Alright, Tom.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
I'm gonna kill you.
Don't ask questions.
I want his name.
How much did he pay you?
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
Truman Capote.
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
Uh huh, pleasure.
My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is.
I'm not positive this means anything.
How are you?  Having any luck?
How... how can you say that to me...?
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
Do you know what happened to her?
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?
Alice, you think you can leave?
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
Kristen, what happened?
I've been working double shifts.
Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
I don't get it.
Nice neighborhood.
Now you know who and what Freddy really is.
You don't get it, he's after me...
Hey...wake up.
Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
Mommy...?
Where is he?
But how...?
You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
Thanks for everything, Dad.
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...
And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
What?
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
I thought about that.
Poor woman...
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.
You could train someone else.
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
Is there any way out of it?
What course, Skipper?
A hundred and eighty fathoms! We can't be sinking that fast....
Swell!
Why?
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
Always has been.
Who?
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
Guaranteed, eh?
Mmm.
Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
Don't mind if I do.
Bastard's got his high beams on.
Yeah.
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.
Dad.
Are we going in this?
It's pretty old.
You're a policeman.
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
What the fuck. My day's already ruined.  Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.
Something bugging you?
How you holding up, Wade?
I won't. You interested?
I still don't understand --
I'm sorry about what I said.
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
Alright. I'll think about it.
Going somewhere, Margie?
You're not using it today?
Coffee's perked.
Hold on!
Marg!
Yeah.
Pop, for Christ's sake!
You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
Well, do you still plan to get married?
Then who shot him?
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
I remember clearly cause when I heard I became real careful around Pop. I was a careful child and I became a careful adult, but at least I wasn't afflicted by that man's violence.
Daddy. Daddy, please...
The Americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
Put your pilot on.
He's dead then. They must have killed him.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
You're pointing a gun at me.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
I'll not going without my family.
Where are we sending it?
Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?
Yeah, right.
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
WE'RE HOOKED!
What?
Kruger, Sagittarius.
What is it, Mary?
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
Dunn.
Elaine.
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
Ted, we're taking off!
I'd use the word insane.
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
Simon just ejected!
Now!
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
Roger.
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.
Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.
Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
I have to see Bud Kruger.
All right, it's a matter of death.
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
Both pilots!
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
No. No one that I know of.
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
Rain.
Rats! I've lost number three.
Ted...
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
Hi!
Roger.
You okay?
Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.
What is this?
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.
Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?
Matthew, you don't have to-- .
If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking for.
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.
I believe he is probably lying.
So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
... and so, and so the doctor says, "If this is the thermometer, then where'd I leave the pen?"  You're not... you don't think that's funny?  George, work with me, I always get a laugh with that one. Look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be?
Stop the car.
How potent?
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
What's this about, George?  I know that look.
You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it.
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?
What kind of test?
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
Can't lock up...
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
And it's too late to shut it down?
I'll go.
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
You did okay, Bishop.
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
Have they located my daughter yet?
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
What about you?  What's your interest in this?
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
Still nothing from the colony?
How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant?
How do you feel?
Seventeen meters.
Let's go!  Let's go!
Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure.  They killed him getting it off.
They'll get us.
What's this?
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
Hicks, don't let him leave.
Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago?
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
What did you say?
I guess we're not leaving, right?
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
Burke!  Open the door!
Look, I told you...
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
Is there a part for me?
Why not?
Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
How was I? Tell me honestly.
What did you think of the music?
Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage.
Is she a good fuck?
No! I won't have him back.
You have leave to try.
Humiliated?
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
Why?
Where?
Why not?
Do you think that's funny?
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
Yes.
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -
You're not going to do this?
What's that? Oh!  Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
No. Don't answer it!
This is not his handwriting.
I see that you're expecting.
When, may I ask?
What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.
Really?
I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.
Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.
Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not.
Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?
Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see.
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
Oh, thank you, sir.
Not that I've seen.
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
I think I've found out about the money, sir.
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
Yes?
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
Put it down!
What for?
My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.
Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.
They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!
I can't say. Really
It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
Did my work please you?
A Mass for the dead.
Are you ill?
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
Where did I stop?
Confutatis Maledictis.
It couldn't be simpler.
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
Oh? Have I seen it?
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
About what?
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
Well?
Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.
No? Was Mozart a good man?
Yes.
Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.
Oh my son, my poor son!
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
You mean that play?
He's setting that play to music?
Where?
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
Well, promise then.
Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh?
You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.
Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.
Yes.
Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
Shall I send a car?
What shall we do?
It wasn't a lunatic.
Mr. Kessler?
You haven't eaten your lunch.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
Do you like it?
Hello. You all right?
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
What?
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
But...
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.
Feeling better?
How are we feeling tonight?
I looked.
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
Lunatic?
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.
You're not having a good time are you?
Well, I like it here.
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
Right.
What do you think was wrong?
Come on, where?
It's in front of us.
Nice doggie. Good boy.
It sounds far away.
You really scared me, you shithead.
Thanks a lot.
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
You're not real.
What are you doing here?
Get out of here, Jack!
You look awful.
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
Remember the Alamo?
I don't rightly know, sir.
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
Let me have ten bucks?
Whose death?
I remember once when your account checked.
Mr. Dickson in yet?
And tell him not to delay.
You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.
We want to talk to you.
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.
Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?
You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you?
know, but
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .
Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it out on me. I haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day I was married.
Well, what?
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
What's this?
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals  I think I will have a drink.
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!
Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.  Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.
I already told him I was home.
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
What's the matter? What's going on here?  This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion.
That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
Well . . . ?
Did you talk to him?
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .
How are you fixed?
Everybody in?
Where's Charlie?
This is healing?
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
Uhh, yeah it does.
We got a problem here, brother?
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
How many of them did he kill?
You have no shame.
What?
What you sayin' boy?
Not now.
Thanks for the help.
Jesse, we got to have a word.
It'll be the biggest score yet.
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.
Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want.
I think one of 'em's glass.
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!
He thinks this is some kind of game!
Hello, Liberty Missoura!
Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself.
How'd it go in there?
And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
Y'know, Uncle Frank...
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
Uncle Frank?
Ma! Please!
Doc Mimms will --
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
Not if I find the right girl.
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
Zee.
Hmm.
Let me see that.
Tennessee?
The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.
I like that.
Well, not exactly.
... too young for whisky...
Why, yeah.
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Really?
Well, this land is about to be condemned.
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile.
Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
With my money!
How did you know?
First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
So he's won.
No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish. 
J&B. Straight.
Pull out.
It's a plain end. I think.
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
Patrick?
I haven't seen you around here.
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
He's good-looking.
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .
Because he dated her.
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
Are you my two o'clock?
Doesn't he live here?
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
Carnes? Wait.
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
There's this theory out now that if you can catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for Christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-
SHUT UP!
What's that, a gram?
Don't, I'll drink it.
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
We are totally booked.
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
After six.
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?
You don't like this, I take it?
Tell him I'm at lunch.
Yes, Patrick?
Anywhere you want?
Jean? Sorbet?
Want a bite?
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?
Jean? What?
Where are you?
You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb.
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay?
Where did you go to school?
How well did you know him?
Do you feel that way?
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
That's so typical, isn't it?
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
I've questioned him.
Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure.
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.
Gee, uh, that's too bad.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
No, man. I'm gonna bail.
How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?
He's your boss. He's not your --
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
You think I don't know that?
How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.
I can't just walk away!
It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?
Are you gonna tell me where you went?
...What?
Milo?
...wanna savor this.
Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant.
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
And Outpost? You're happy there?
Will I get to work for Outpost?
Okay.
Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
Who's that?
I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room.  It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up.
'Think I should buy some originals?
How's it going?
It's okay. Really.
Milo. What's up?
Had you talked to him much lately?
I'm okay. It's going well!
You could've handwritten it.
Ready for number three?
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --
Just thought his work should go on.
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?
Every entry was authorized.
Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.  What would Milo want in here, anyway?
You calling Phil and Randy?
Come with me.
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
Did you wanna be alone?
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
Do we post it on the Net?
How close are you?
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
Why were you snooping in my office?
'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are?
Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.
Thank God.
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
Why?!
They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop?
Bring it to the other location.
They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers.
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
So how'd you like the house?
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.
That kid's the great white hope.
Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now.
Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
Come in.
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
Yes.
Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.
I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
Be careful.
Oh, yes. Thank you.
My God, Austin, what have you done?
Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!
Let me guess. The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device.
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
Austin, may I have a word with you?
Not in the Nineties.
Out and about, doing odds and sods.
Thank God, Austin, we made it.
Does that make you horny?
That's not the way to get ahead in life.
Austin, I'm coming with you.
I have something to tell you.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.
We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;
Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
Quite impressive.
Hi.
Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?
In due time.
Umm, that also has already happened.
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
What about his teeth?
Did you ever...
And how do you feel about that?
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
Nature ...
May I help you, madam ...
How curious ...
I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?
An unholy trinity ...
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
You know, I believe she's actually jealous.
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
I was about to throw in the towel.
Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
No thanks.
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
That's what we were working on.
Yes ... ?
But you did suspect me.
I thought you played by the rules.
What's that you're wearing?
I'll be back ...
Mrs. Peel?
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.
Where's Mother?
This man -- did you see him?
You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?
No, please! I beg you ...
What's happening?
What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
Hey, you guys, what's going on?
Man, you're losing your audience.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
Fine. How's everything going?
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
Cole, we've got to talk.
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
That feels so great.
Um... that's very relaxing.
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
This is it, lady. Last stop.
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.
Your whores never showed up.
I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
It's true.
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
Are any of those right?
You're all under arrest. Open up!
Feel free.
Ed... you're kinky!
I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?
What's the matter?
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?
Right in there, pal.
How 'bout this?
Now, don't get into any trouble.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
Can you believe how perfect it fits?
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?
Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.
People actually used to pay you for this?
Why'd you come here, Brian?
What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
There's only so much technology can do.  Thanks for the beer.
Hey.
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
Huh.
With grenadine, right?
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
Hey.
Hi.
What'll you do?
I'm close... but I can't get who it is...
Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?
-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
I want another shot, Sir.
Are you still here?
Where are you going?
Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...
Read.
Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue.
I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. 
Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
Completely out of control.
Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".
So, you surviving without me?
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
He treats you okay?
I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
Knock it off. Now.
Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.
When are you going to catch the prick that's doing this, Don?
We still haven't found a connection between the victims.
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
I'm a little busy right now --
I got it, man! I will find those kids. And I'll get the 50 G from the Church! Then the kids'll go to jail. I'll be in charge, of course. After a little while, I'll break the fuckers out -- and I'll turn them in to shithead I was just talking to. And pick up his 100 G. No. I'll hit him up for 200 G. Or 250 G. l can do it -- 'cause I've got the kids. Then, of course, there's the 180 G I'm gonna pick up on the Game tonight -- when the Strawberries win!
How come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the Church haven't come up with shit? You got some kinda inside track?
There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Large?
I want 15 on the Mets.
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
I also thought of that bread, Father. And of that night six days ago when the Mother Superior died, and I kept the cool, damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve God?
As I have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning -- and my sin. You see, Father --
Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.
He gots to be did.
Everybody say Ho!
My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
Seconds and thirds, too.
Good morning, Cheeba.
What kind of show is this gonna be?
What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?
Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.
Ahh, the luxuries of life.
What do I have to do?
You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways.  Brother man, I'm blacker than you.  I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white.
We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.
Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass.  They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air.  Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows.  We're on in 3 weeks.  Didya hear what I just said, Yo?
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
So he drank himself into a stuper?
You lost me.
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
This is the group I was telling you about.
We both lied to him.
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you.
So you have your small victory, now what?
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
Not nervous?  Relaxed?
You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
Mantan, we got a show to tape.
You must think I'm some kind of fool.
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.
This is a TV show, not a music video.
The Mantan Manifesto.  Catchy ain't it?  Number One.  We gainfully employ African Americans, in front of and behind the cameras.  Two. Let the audience decide.  Three. Who put these critics in charge? These so-called cultural police? Four.  Who determines what is black? Five.  Mantan is a satire.  Six. If they can't take a joke, "F" 'em.
No, we're not knocking boots.  I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
...not that time...
Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny.
Maybe you need to start.
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
Good day to you, young sir.
There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?
Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.
What are the Chevalier's intentions?
You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.
That's a very handsome sword you have there.
I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.
I don't know.
Then you yield to me.
Not one.
Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?
Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.
I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?
As much as possible?
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?
How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Good night, papa.
Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.
Don't you ever point a gun at me!
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --
We finished the course and came here, then heard an explosion --  Where's Pike?
You too?
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
I don't know... I like the Army.
You smoke, Ray?
Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it.
So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --
He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
Where?
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
Where's the cabin?
Cadet, what's your name!
What the fuck is going on?
What do you mean, West's?
Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.
His chest was hamburger --
There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --
My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.
Is it the truth?
Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
Where are they!
He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --
What I said before --
Yeah.
I'm sorry, Bill.
It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?
Hostile and uncooperative.
I didn't mean that as a compliment.
You made me look like an idiot --
We're in the middle of a murder case --
Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.
This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
"Too neat." How long have you been an investigator?
Why do you care?
I didn't shoot West...
Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
You wanted to break him.
You know, you never told me why you left the army.
We were close to something with Kendall.
No.
Four --
What?
West?
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
He was your friend.
I don't think I want to hear this --
We should tell him we're not going.
Pike never confessed.
Dunbar says you were.
What happened with Nunez?
Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West --
Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?
Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.
You were expecting me?
I have to leave. Tonight.
You get the eye?
Bloom!
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.  Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, "Your Aunt is going to die." I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.
I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
The one about the witch.
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.
You owe me three-fifty.
Son?
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
You become what you always were. A very big fish.  And that's the way it happens.
I'm sorry.
You don't even know me.
It's me. Norther Winslow.
I don't believe it!
Were you and my father having an affair?
Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.
Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.
You didn't become crazy.
I'm going to check on him.
I talked with your father last night.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
What happened?
How did you get here?
Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
Josephine and I have a lot in common.
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
You first.
Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me 150.
It's enough isn't it?
Yes.
This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.
You can see why it's sensitive?
Hello.
Sorry. You've lost me...
Right.
She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!
Tell me.
How is bank?
He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.
Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
I don't want to know.
Fine.
What?
I got what I paid for.
You are throwing me out.
You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.
What happened between you and the blonde?
Nobody's that unhappy.
You know you can come under the blanket.
Okay. Thank you.
Okay. Goodbye.
Hurry. I'll wait for you here.
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
Angela?
Thank you.  Oh. My wife. She had a card here for her migraine pills. She ain't gonna be around no more... So if you...
When? Now? Oh. No.
What do you need?
Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
Thought you had a skirt earlier.
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
YOU SHUT UP!
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
You testing me? Huh? You testin' me, old man?
Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE!
Where's Ronnie?
I don't got any money... for fixin' me up and all.
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
Wicked little bitch... gonna cut me...
Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?
Tell me what to do.
I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
Bojo called. Said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle.
I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face.
You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.
Gotta get that chain off her, Laz. Somethin' like this gets out, you could land in a heap of trouble.
There you go, preacher man. Get me drunk so I don't stick my foot up yo ass.
Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.
So...  That your first time?
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
I'm a what?
Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout...
Wait up.  You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window --
What's this?
Back-up.
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
I call, right?  I say I got the dreaded thirty six-hour Asian shits from some raw clam and we stretch it into three days.  You and I become a driving force on the local Geisha scene.
What'd you say?
Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
Joyce can be nice.
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!
How'd you get this?
Know her?
If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend --
Nick --
No...
You did great, Ichiro.
I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
How many men?
Someone attacked him.
You know, Nick, we can't lose.
Louder, pal, louder.
You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
You're wrong to sell Ich short.
You'll get Ich killed.
Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers.  The Japanese embassy is very interested.
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us.
Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along...
He knows what he's doing.
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.
Why are you staring at us?
I think, therefore I am.
Industrial refuse.
Yeah.
Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin.
Yeah.
When might that be?
How do I stop one?
Thank you very much.
How long you had these guys?
One more, eh?
How old am I?
What's that?
Love is just another name for sex. Love is sexy and sex is lovely -- I don't care what you call it, an android can't have it.
During the road test...
You're going to be over the limit.
I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.
You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?
What shows?
Yeah?
How do you mean 'exploited'?
Do I make you nervous?
Did you cry when your father died?
Have you ever known anybody a long time?
Ten years.
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
May I ask a personal question?
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
You want to go home?
What about friends?
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
Methuselah Syndrome.
You're kidding!
I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
Please excuse this interruption.
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
Dickhead?
What's wrong with you?
It was amazing.
Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!
Watching television in color.
Who are these people?
Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.
Bites what?
They're all divorced?
Now, get out!!
Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
May I please be excused?
About clothing?
My goodness gracious!  This place is something!
No!  Not crazy!
What?
My pleasure.
Really?  Okay!
No.
Is this because of the radiation?
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
I've got to go, now.
How do I leave here?
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roul!
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
What's baseball?
Like one of Mom's?
Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French.
...the pipe tobacco.
But, I don't understand.
My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!"  I bet they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?!
Not particularly.
Right on the button.
This must be very new.
I don't think so.
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
Why did you park way back there?
Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.
How old are you?
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
Sure.
Say what?!
I do alright.
No.
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
Good god.
So...you...survived the blast, did you?
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"
Well, put it down and come in!
No.  They all do.
Days??
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
What's that noise?
To go up.
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!
Is there a problem?
I've noticed.
No.  I think it's just right.
Watch this!
Calvin!
Get the presents and do the lights.
What did you wish for, Adam?
Yes, yes it is!
Yes.
We stay down here.
I want him to at least see the sky!
He's smart.
How long will you set it for this time?
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.
Alright, I will.
That water's freezing!
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
What?
I don't think so.
Oh, no!
What do you want to do with it?
We came back to the house!
I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!
I'm selling this place.  I want out of this hell hole!
Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
Jeffrey?
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
What color is it?
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
Yes? What is it?
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
THEN WHAT?
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
What do you want from me?
Thank you. honey.
Yes.
No.
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Hi, can I come in?
I liked being with you last night.
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
Come on Dorothy.
I love you Don with all my heart.
You what?
There's no disease, I can tell you.
What?
Yeah, it's me.
They hurt his head.
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
Can I feel 'em?
Heineken.
What are you lookin' at?
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
Well. Okay.
I'm going out for awhile.
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
Would you like a piece of cake?
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Well.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
I guess I'll see you sometime.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
Here's to. An interesting experience.
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
Okay, yeah, call.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
You want a Dairy Queen?
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
Okay, be careful.
What am I going to do?
Oh yeah?
Everything okay?
Okay.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
NO.
Jeffrey? What's going on?
Look Jeffrey.
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
What did he bring him in for?
There's ways around that.
Lord's name.
Are ya ready?
Are these me considered armed and dangerous?
Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one.
Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
What are you saying?
You think they sold me out? No way.
No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out!
What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
Mother, is that you?
How's Uncle Sibeal?
Well, we could try the bag over the head thing. Walk you right out the front.
All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?
How do you think he figured all this out without talking to us?
Absolutely not.
Know what we need, man?... some rope.
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
Who did you kill?
I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.
They were wearing masks.
Maybe the three of them had something in common.
The shooter knew these guys, huh?
What?
I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!
Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!
Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.
After talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth. After she watches them whack him, she passes out.  Why the two extra victims?
What the...?
Oh my god!
This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?
Hello?
You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.
Well he sure as fuck knew you!
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?
But in this day and age I believe what they do is... necessary. I feel it is... correct.
Yes.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
How was I ridiculing you?
Did you see that?
It had an alarm.
Anthony, give me the fucking gun!
Why not?
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
What the fuck is going on here?
They don't?
See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.
Where was I?
I wish I'd been there.
I have an idea for that.
Sixteen dollars.
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
You could give somebody a concussion.
Or I might end up with a broken nose.
We all set?
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
What's happening? What's going on?
Where's Kumar?
So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?
I think I may have found a way out of here.
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
See you.
What?
Yeah. Let's keep it --
Were you born in Mexico?
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand.
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
Well, what do you think?
No.
They are.
You stole a Trans-Am.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
What was that all about?
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
Is he chasing us?
Bob. Are you coming?
The weed.
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
What do you mean get back?
Bob, that makes no sense.
Give me the keys, Dignan.
Yes, I do.
Scarecrow?
The elevator broke.
Wait a second --
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
What do you mean grammar?
The grammar?
He left his sweater.
Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?
How's the weather down there?
Come on in!
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
Treadstone.
I want to know what happened.
...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This...
You don't know what you're getting into here.
So what's he doing? You believe him?
What?
Sit down.
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
No. It's because you don't know how they died.
It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.
I have to go now.
Try again.
We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.
So...
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
My first job.
What do you want?
Why am I alive?
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
You didn't answer my question.
-- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --
Alright... take it down.
This is everything? Is there.
I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?
Mr. Nevins?
We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed.
Someone dead from this household?
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
Longshanks promised!
No, M'lord.
Good day to you, M'Lords.
When will his trial be?
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
You'll move
I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
Treason. Against whom?
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
You've been here before?
Did it work?
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.
You will die! It will be awful!
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you.
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first.
Anything.
You'd be surprised how often they are.
Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.
There must be a way to fix this.
You're. Acting. Like your father.
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
Just tell me if anything weird happens.
What did you see? What did it look like?
Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.
Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand?
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.
Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.
Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.
Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?
Why are you doing all this for me?
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
I want you to take this, Lenny. Today's your day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby --
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
Sure you don't want your wallet?
I was?
We're really gonna be in a movie!?
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
Come on, go on...
I couldn't cut the rope.
What the hell are you doing?
Shut up, Tommy!
You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
Here you go, buddy.
Monsieur Rick?
Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
You want my advice?
Go back to Bulgaria.
Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.
Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
Yes, I come.
Hello, Rick.
What do you want for Sam?
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.
Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
Do you know where they are?
Rick?
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
Why there is no other man in my life?
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
Yes, of course, we --
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?
Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?
-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
But why my name, Richard?
I don't understand. What about you?
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
Yes.
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.
I must find out what Berger knows.
We are only interested in two visas, Signor.
He does. Could we have a table close to him?
Yes?
No, Victor, there isn't.
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
Your work.
Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?
I understand.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.
For the time being.
Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major.
Ho, diplomatist!
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day.
Oh, but I just told you. --
Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
You know, this place will never be the same without you, Ricky.
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
Come on, we're going to get your coat.
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
Hello?
Thank you.  Will you have a drink with me please?
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
He'll double what I pay you.
What's that you're playing?
Where is she? Have you seen her?
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.
What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day?  The next day we just start over again.
Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You never gave up.
Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
This isn't working out.
That's your dog.
There isn't any us.
What's that?
That about sums it up.
This is so unfair.
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
Anything else?
Really?
Look, I help take care of the place.  You got my check, didn't you Mom?
I've got all this back pay coming.  Why don't you let me get you a place in town?
Hmmm.  Durango, Colorado; Asheville, North Carolina, then...canceled her account.
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
How'd it go?
You fucked us over.
Forget it.
A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
Cool ropes.
That's all there is.
That's what it's about.
What, then?
Only if you can afford it.
This is *your* life story, Wilbur! You just changed the dates!
He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
It's time somebody ate *them*.
How about him not needin' the friggin' compass! How about that?
I've never seen a lobster.
I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything.
Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?
I better go.
But you looked as if you liked it.
The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here?
Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?
Hi...
Wally thinks apples are boring.
Is *your* father dead?
Uh... it's the end of October.
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
What kind of plane are you flying?
No, I'm not. I need a job.
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
They're migrants.
It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?
That's better. I can tell you got yourself some education. Them's good hands you got, Homer. Them hands you got, they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right?
Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.
Homer, don't you know what business you in? You don't wanna go into no business with me, Homer--ain't that right?
Please listen to me! *Both* of you...
It looks like scurvy.
I thought it was my turn.
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
I am not a doctor.
What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer.
Good-bye, Arthur.  Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?
Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you.
They told me I was too old to serve.
It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at.
She's *good* with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her?
That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right.
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!
Uh, right... And that was it. That's when we decided to start our own business. No more shithead bosses.
Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
We had to finalize the deal.
I can see why you liked her.
She had you tempting fate.
Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today?
Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young. The whole thing took about two and a half hours. That's how good he is.
Fuck that. We're going too.
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?
Minus one.
That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?
Don't get me wrong, Jake. I like you boys. You guys are the steadiest business in town. But what can I say? Twenty percent's still better than what we give to any of the other criminals.
Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
What do I have to do?
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
Uh... Everything okay?
He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.
We were friends. I trusted him. I should have known it was weird. But, then again I was weird.
You are such a raving pussy sometimes.
Sorry. I didn't know...
You tell them the "Tale".
Do we want insurance?  I'm just asking...
Is it all fugasi?
Him.
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
When this is all over, you're going to tell me who the King put on Al.
Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
What'd he say?
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
Ten percent.
The King, huh? Nice going.
Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him.
You guys awake?
Who?
Bullshit it's cosmetic! My fucking tooth was cracked in half. I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity. The department's dental is for shit.
The Indian rope-trick.
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
All right. As what?
Last hand.
And your lady?
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
What's the time?
You're shaking. What is it?
Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier.
You're my conscience.
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
Nothing about you.
Why did you take the money?
No.
For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion. 
It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
To coincidence.
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
How did you hurt your hand?
He doesn't gamble.
What happened?
I owe a lot of money.
I want you to forget what I said.
Would you like a drink?
How are you?
I'm Lucy.
So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.
Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.
So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy.
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.
Ever?
That hair will have to go.
Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella.
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
What's he doin'?
Where is the key?
It didn't go off.
What was that, I didn't hear...
Find me something, I don't care where it is.
Quantum is up thirty-five.
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
Hey, bomb...
This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20. I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?
Pinback...
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Veil nebula.
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix! They glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said.
Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah, there's something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you something.
What's that, sir?
Yes sir. Negative effect.
Negative effect.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
Sir?
Okay, okay.  I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to?
You're attractive, you're smart.  Stand on your own two feet, know what I mean? And you got a wicked sense of humor. Man, you really zinged the boss a couple times, it was all I could do--
Man, you got a bad attitude.
What?
This is what your life's worth, Bruno.
Move it.
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
But I'm afraid of--
Which is none of your business...or mine.
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
What a creep.
Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet.
What else can we do?
Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think.  If she hears her kid's voice...
You're a thief?
I was expecting someone else.
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--
Well, not me personally.
These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder.  The oldest is twelve.  The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.
That was taken nine years ago... I.D.'d as Michael Hanover.  Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins, Wyoming for armed robbery.  He escaped from custody after 4 days.  Hasn't been seen or heard from since.
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
I don't know what your story is and I don't want to.
Whoever tossed this place wants you.  And I'm looking to stay outta the line of fire.
I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.
Yeah.
Not right now.
Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
Make the call.
I don't see how you cheating on Natalie involves me.
And you were a sympathetic ear.
So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.
I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it.
We've got to take this slow...
So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?
Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids?
I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime.
You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing? I wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me.
...at twenty-thirty hours.
Any luck?
Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.
Now, how are we gonna do this?
Could be.
How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
Dude, this is all I got.
You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot.
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
Cool.
Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
Jeremiah, what are you doing?
Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
Twenty-five more'n I got.
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.
What happened?
Like a DeLorean.
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
Who is... we?
What happened to your eye?
Wow. Did he go to jail?
Where are we going?
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
Well...
That's alright... I understand.
We're moving through time.
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
What? How long was I asleep?
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?
My mom is gone.
What?
People aren't that simple.
I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?
Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.
So, I met a new friend.
Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.
How are things going at school?
A sign from whom?
How does that make you feel?
And they grow out of our stomachs?
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
That I did it again.
I think now that he might...
I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
How is that possible?
Then how is time travel possible?
When will this happen?
He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
What's her name?
Why would I tell Mom?
Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss...
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
If that's what you think is necessary.
What?
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.
How did this happen?
Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.
There's no rule!
You're what?!
So, what do I say?
You-betcha.
Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
...Yah -- 1963. Her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in Louisville, her hometown. Those were different times.
Oh shit!
C'mere. I love you so much.
Okay... well, bye.
What do you mean, they take out her butt?
Are we on "Cops" again?
Hi.
It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.
They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it.
The bitch.
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
Oh, there's a parking space over there. Oh, no, that's just a compact. Sorry.
Oh! What is it?
Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
EE-AAAYEEEE-AAAAYOUIAAAEEEEEEEE!
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
And wear a crown and everything.
My dear President...  read it back...
There's still something wrong with it... take out "President" ...now what've you got?
That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail.
Here I am, Father...
Go out and chase that peanut vendor away from the building -- Get rid of him if you have to use violence - if necessary call out the militia and if he isn't looking get me a bag of peanuts.
Yes -- why?
No, but I shot some ducks.
I don't wanna work at all.
You know, I'd be lost without a telephone.  Now - where were we? Oh, yes - I just made you Secretary of War.  The first thing you do is buy ammunition -- you buy it from me and I get 10% commission.
My card.
You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story?
Send in the next girl. 
He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.
Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?
That's funny, we've got five thousand horses but no men.
With a gun like that you can kill some of your own men.
Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary.
It must be done right away.
If we should choose to chew, we'll be pursued -
Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?
Are you sure you're not tired?
Excellency, may I present my niece.
This has gone far enough!  This interruption is humiliating, to say the least...
Oh -- you mean... worm?
Your Excellency, the eyes of the world are upon you.  Notables from every land are gathered here in your honor --  This is a gala day for us.
Oh, Rufus!
Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...
My purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it.
But -
Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!
Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
What happened?
I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?
Never mind that, I want my man!
DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?
Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
Oh, is he a friend of yours?
It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.
Treves. Well done.
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...
How are you feeling today?
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
What is it, Treves?
Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.
Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.
You never mentioned his mental state.
Alas, no.
Tell me about it, please!
Romance!
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all...
The hallway? Oh, the wastecan!
I'll have to find some more.
Merrick...
Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?
...Yes potatoes... but...
I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
Good evening. How are you feeling?
Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed?
Who are they of?
The Children. Where are your children
How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?
You want a dressing bag, John?
Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
Very smart indeed.
So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here.
I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?
So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?
Right! Where is he?
WHY?
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
Where's the Cloak Invisible?
But you don't realize....
Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the "Viking"?
But have you ever seen it? Think back...
Would you like us to sing to you?
A lot of people like our singing.
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
I'll tell you what...
You don't know Halfdan the Black.
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Louder.
You told them I raped you -- why?
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
Is THAT Odin?
"But" what?
Let's hack her to pieces.
You talking piffle, son?
Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
You mean we'd be dead?
No! Let go, Snorri!
Wait, Erik!
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
Bye, Leif.
What's all the panic about?
You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it.
Wasn't it, Keitel?
Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
I should have got rid of you long ago!
So did my father and his father before him.
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
I must KILL! Kill!
KILL! KILL!
Well, of course he is!
He drove me mad!
He's not in Valhalla! He died of old age!
Shut up.
And you've got BOTH axes?
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
And keep your sword greased.
I don't know, honey. It's horrible.
You weren't supposed to see that.
I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it. You okay? You seem quiet.
How are you today?
You rat.
Oh, Tangerine.
I'm so excited. Yay!
Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.
I'm sorry.
Why what?
It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders, right?
I can't remember.
I'm sure you would.
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
Where do you live?
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
You like that?
It's pretty.
God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.
Well, I should probably get going.
Thanks.
You should stay.
Yo ho ho!
I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
What?!
I want to know you.
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
Such a beautiful view.
Oh?
What if you hide me?
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
Do you remember what we talked about?
Yeah.
I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.
Well, you're married.
Probably.
I know.
This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.
What do we do?
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
Cool.
It's dark.
When?
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
A bully? Moi?
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
Hi, it's Joel.
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!
Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...
She's so sexy.
What?
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.
So you don't mind?
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
So you think the dissertation will get published?
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?
Stan... c'mon...
It's freezing out.
I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap...
I don't know! I just said that!
It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.
Okay, we're back in.
Howard, they've disappeared again.
Oh, hi.
I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell in love with her last night.
Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very --
I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
A traveler, eh?
Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink.
That's Jellybean!
How does she like what in bed?
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
I'm cold.
Why? Why do you have to go?
That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.
Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.
But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?
Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows?
...do you copy?
...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!
We have a man down...
Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.
Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...
It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal...
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
How is he?
He'll live... if we ever make it back.
I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of.  And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
What's wrong?
90 over 50 and falling... .
You're not seriously considering sending him?
What does?
Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
I put in for a replacement for you but no one...
Okay. I'm on the bridge.
Captain Miller, I just want to say...
Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity...
You're in the central corridor. It connects the personnel areas to Engineering.
I can see that, what're they for?
No one?
Yes.
We're a long way from home and we're in a bad place. Let's not make it worse. If anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time.
That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
What are you talking about?
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...
Captain Miller, you copy?
Skipper...
Smith, get out of there...
The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us.
Oxygen is not the problem.
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports...
BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...
He served on the Goliath.
Here's another one. They're all over the place.
We have to do something, oh God...
The safety circuit's failed!
What is it?
Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
What are you doing?
What is it?
I mean...
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
Where is Reed?
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
Ben?
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
No more cracks about how I look.
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
You're on fire!
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
Stop it.
What is that thing?
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
You're really cramping my style here.
Then what is it?
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge.
I mean, you broke up with me, right?
Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
Not until Ben is back inside!
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
'Scuse me.
Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again.
I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.
Something happened to them, mon.
Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here.
Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is?  What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over.  So who do you have first period?
You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
Are you still a virgin?
Does Mom know you have company?
Leave me alone!
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
Do you have any ice tea?
Are you really a virgin?
There's only one thing we can do. We've got to get rid of it. We've got to get an abortion.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.
Yo.
Mark. What happened to your date?
Hey, Mark. Is that you?
Well, I've gotta be running.
The Attitude, Damone, is only good until you meet the right girl.
My brother's car!
We just missed the turnoff to the party.
Don't you like him?
Was it great?
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner.
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
Another summer of working at Swenson's.
Where's Doug?
Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
You just ripped my card in two!
I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
I think I've made my point with you tonight.
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
Aloha, Mr. Hand!
Where do you feel like going?
You keep them.
Do you have Mrs. George for English?
Are you all right?
I had a really nice time tonight.
No. That's okay.
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
...I've got to go home.
I made a fool of myself.
What about the notes?
Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
Really?
There's no hurry! The race is over!
What's the message? My light is blinking.
Killed?
Naw! That's science fiction stuff!
What do you mean by that?
Oh, my God!...
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me.
Oh, Jesus! Did you see what god just did to us?
Shoot it.
Why?
Yeah... I thought we might need it...
Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?
Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!
What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!
You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!
The only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards. But, it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect: My attorney.
Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet Barbra...
As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.
This is a fucking nightmare.
What could they do? The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds. He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M-16s.
Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.
I know, but the guy didn't have any cash to pay me. He's one of these Satanism freaks. He offered me human blood -- said it would take me higher than I've ever been in my life.  I thought he was kidding, so I told him I'd just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome -- or maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland to chew on.
Extract of pineal!
Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland.
Fuck the car. They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio.
The airport is over there!
No! I can't get out! They'll crucify me. I'll have to take the blame!
What?
Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!
Oh, and don't bother to make up the room. That way we won't have to risk another of these little incidents, will we?
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
You know where it is?
IS IT CLEAR?!
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
Well, it don't look pretty.
I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge.
I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here.
We shot a skunk.
They're right here.
You all sure about this?
We just smeared a skunk.
I'm in.
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
What is this?
You wanna see, baby?
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
What?
I wouldn't do that, son.
Welcome back.
Bullshit.
'Eh, Chief?
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
What's wrong?
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
Hold it!
Get to your cars!
Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.
Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
Well... come on.
And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures.
Excuse me, sir?
Well... you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics.
Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes.
That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
Thank you, Ralph.
What do I do, Dad?
Of course.
...So what do you think?
Are you... are you hungry?
See you next weekend?
Name?
Why?
Aren't you ever going back?
Whattaya mean?
What?
You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there.
I kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, I would have been miserable living his life.
You don't know what you want.
Jesus.
But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
Shit. I meant the other way around.
Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything.
How the hell do you find me anyway?
What's left of my blood.
How... how ya doin', Farmer?
Very slow.  But we're not going to stop, are we?
Where you goin'?
Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here... I am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail.
What?
'But how do I know you love me?'
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!
I think I need a little air.
I'll have lunch ready by one.
Where are you going?
You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?
Is there something else?
What?
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
Huh?
And do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family?
Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?
It can't be as bad as that.
Your crime... as well as mine.
Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
What is this?
This was not taken from a grave.
Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!
Are you all right?
Victor. I love you,
My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.
I've no choice
I thought I'd never see you again!
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
No. But someday.
You can't. Death is God's will!
We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
Are you sure you'll be all right?
Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
Philosophical?
You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.
Professor Waldman.
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
Re-configure the leads?
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death itself.
Ah. An explorer.
He's dead... She's dead... all dead... Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh my God, oh my God... oh God...
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
You draw very well.
You want to leave?
What'll you do when you leave here?
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
Help you clean up?
Where?
Jack?
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
What's the matter with it?
I'll be along.
This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
I'll be okay. Holy shit...
You saved my life.
Thanks.
You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
How about our last jay?
I love you.
Don't call him.
This is no dream. Want to escape for a while?
Doctor. Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be?
You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded.
How much do I owe you?
I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!
Good luck.
How many with you?
What is your purpose in Mexico?
What was that?
No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new.
Why do you want to stop?
Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions.
How'd she die?
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
Died instantly?
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
Why'd ya quit?
Why are you so agitated?
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
What's this stuff?
I promise.
I just bet you would. Don't even think about it. Besides, I want to have one night's sleep in an honest- to-goodness bed. The beds in the home are okay, but they're not like a real bed.
What do you think Mom would say?
You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
Not good enough, swear to God.
What's going on?
You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?
Yeah, we got a bible.
Are you okay?
Watch my back!
Should I use the last bullets on us?
-- see this, television!
For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours. The Bureau, local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.
He says you were scratching.
Whiskey!
Best in Mexico.
Do they have cable?
Do they have an X-rated channel?
Did you even to try to negotiate?
Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?
Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. We showed our ass in Texas. We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The El Paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us.
I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?
I don't know, you just passed out.
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
I'm lookin' scared?
How?
I'm here with you.
How are you?
He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was too far away. If flinging that door and filling this room with those bat-things would save him, I'd fling it. The only thing it'll do is turn us into one of them.
Administration, Ensign Blondell.
-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.
Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
Then good night.
Permission to leave, sir?
I'm saying, we're just friends.
Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'.
I ain't gonna shoot her.
Yes?
Hardly the case, Senator.
"The Lark Report."
Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.
"Coronado."
I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable.
What the hell is the President trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's thunder?
Montgomery, why do they call you "Flea"?
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me.  But I don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  It's just gonna hurt us both, okay?
Hey.  You okay, Flea?
Come on, Montgomery...
Time.
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
Just a coincidence?
Unless you Whiskey Run.
By the way, I'll need that option paper by 11-hundred today so I can review it with Admiral Hanover.  And do we have any of that breakfast tea around here?
I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --
Well, not this.  I was doing the Pentagon scene few nights ago.  Got some fresh stuff -- about you.  You may be in a hostile camp.  I think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn.
So why are you telling me this?
Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?
No shortage of suspects.
Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
Which is guy-speak for...
It was made clear.  Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's hell, then it levels out.  Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's hell-and-a-half.
Who is it?
You really came back for more?  Of this?
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing special.
What're you guys doing?  Huh?
If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area.  Now how smart is that?
Permission to get dressed, sir?
Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion.  Men fight better without women around.  And that is an historical fact.
Simple question, lieutenant.  No reason not to answer.  What is your father's name?
That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
Say again?  How many micks?
Anybody usin' these drawers here?
I just wonder how that happened.
Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.
We're fucked.
Can't live with them, can't kill them.  What's the point?
Thought you two were file-closed.
Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
I take it this file is still open.
What?
That why you dumped him?
Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.
Don't you think we have enough?
Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
And you think this creature is one of them?
The ultimate expression of evolution, it reproduces asexually. Think about it, all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction. That's why he came to New York. Like every species of insufficient progenitors, he's nesting!
I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.
What the hell are you doing?
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
We did it! We've got the exclusive! Way to go, Audrey!
Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?
They didn't make it.
CHARGEURES, property and casualty insurance. We are preparing a report.
Major, what do you think could have done this?
Right. The worm guy.  Can someone get those people off the beach?
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint.
But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was injured and bled.
Do you have any idea what's going on out there? The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city.
I need you to trust me.
I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
I think we should leave now.
I understand.
This is it?
Okay, Quellek, let's get back to the command deck and-Suddenly we hear a PISTOL BLAST and Quellek's chest turns RED. Alexander and Quellek look down at the blood, horrified.
You WILL go out there.
There it is. The Beryllium sphere.
ALEXANDER??? PLEASE? You're my advisor, advise me!
He wants to THINK!?
He's a miserable twit!
Alex you can't -just leave.
I don't know.
He dissed us AGAIN, Brandon!
Commander, as I was saying... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?
Brandon.. Just in case I die, there's something I have to know...
How did you come to that conclusion?
What's the weather like outside?
A hologram...
"Crewman #6"... Call me Guy.
The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
Where are the miners?
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
They're still behind us...
They're gone.
It's Jason...
You should have let me hit him.
Oh my god! Tommy! Stop the pod! Stop the pod!
JASON  You think you could-get any closer to those mines?
Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy.
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
Weapons storage...
To our brave guests.  Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes.  We are blessed to count ourselves among them.
Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
A model, only as big as this.
Anything.
Sorry Guys... It just went off.
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?
They died well.  Otherwise, they didn't do much right.  But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies.
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
Go on... I want to hear everything.
What do you think, George, shall I resign?  It's what they want.
The army needs you.
Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all.
They're ready.  Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything.  Of course, we get nothing from Congress.  They need boots, coats... we desperately need food.
As soon as the men have good shelters I'll move.  Perhaps Martha will join me this winter.
No uniforms.  No coats, even?  In this weather?
How old are you, Captain?
Excuse me, General, but may I ask how do you feel?
I'm so inclined.
Sir, Arnold is a traitor.
What is this?
Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?
They are... friends of Congress.
Partially...
Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
The British army, sir!
My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold?  He's up there.
A grand scheme?
Sir, please accept my commission from Congress... and...  You must see this portrait of my beautiful wife, Adrienne, we had the most perfect little baby girl just before I left.  Her name is Henriette...
'Charming little victories?' Please don't expect much more of us, Monsieur.
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
"Liberty, Virtue, Country"... That's from Cato... you know, that play about the noble Romans?  As I was riding up to Philadelphia, I found myself thinking about the old days...
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
We can't take them.  Are you all right?
Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform...
Well, the widow Curtis will bring you riches, position, land, even half-grown children.  You won't have to do anything at all!  You shan't have to do another thing to prove yourself.
Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?
So, you are William's wild young neighbor?  Or should I say, 'brother'; William claims you as a member of his family.  I have heard so many unflattering tales about you, and I understand, that except for you, this 'family' is quite cultivated.
Think what the play means, William. Perhaps these words have a place in the real world.
You're out of your mind!
And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
My daughter, I ask only...
Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
He knew it was a set up. He was ready for it.
After this one, I'm out, Cat, you understand? This is the last time we talk to each other.
Hell, why not just shoot her? Why not shoot everybody. Fuckin' shoot me. Shoot the fuckin' president?
You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
What're you hanging around with a guy like that for? You were in the movies, right? A stuntman? What's he ever done he can talk about? You feel okay?
Maybe your nephew panicked, took off.
Says here you're getting Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy.
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
I can't believe the way you guys do business out here. I can't believe how fucked up your organization is.
Karen? You okay?
You positive about that?
He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
So, what, this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee, that what we're talking about here?
What?
Something shouldn't be there.
Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
Have we met? I don't recall.
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
You want to hear this idea? It's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. Go on, tell her.
That's it? That's your movie?
Is that right, that's what you do for a living?
I imagine in your line of work, there were times you had to get rough, you know, say one of your customers stopped paying.
Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.
She looks familiar.
You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'
You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.
You got a miss. Leo Devoe. Guy's six weeks over.
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed?
The wife sues the airline.  This is a gutsy babe.
What's that?
Whatta you think, Chill?
It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake?
But you won't know where I am. I don't even know where I'll be.
No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.
Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think's real funny.
Yeah?
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
I don't know.
Were you scared up there?
They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?
I told you not to -
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
Hello, Doris.
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
What's wrong?
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.
Harry -
I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they?
Karen. Wow. Look at you...
I'm sitting here, I'm looking at you and I'm having these flashes. You know, flashbacks, of memories.  Of us.
Lufkin. His... agent.
Roger, North Island. Please advise pending further information. Over.
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Your radio check is affirmative. Over.
One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire.
Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.
Maureen.
Roger.
Ready?
Guess I'll just keep working.
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
Yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over.
If you get it back in one piece.
With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop.
How much longer's that gonna take?
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
How long, then?
Goddamit, Dodge.
I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger. Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget.
I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?
Dodge to Murphy.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
I didn't touch the fucking radio!  Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?
Yeah.
That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.
That's a good thing?
Go on.
Coffee?
Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
Take it easy, you'll live longer.
No cowboy shit up there, understand?
How's he doing?
You're saying they mutinied for the gold?
Hey.
The what?
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.
What, like some kind of ghost?
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.
What happened.
Epps? You there?
Hard to say which is worse, staying here or taking our chances in open water.
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
Pretty low all around.
Say what?
What about the gold?
I thought you say Tuesday.
You're kidding, right?
Someone from the past.
What?
Hey... so, what brings you down here?
What are you trying to say?
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
Did you actually do this painting?
Look, that's the policy... if you want to make up your own rules you can open your own theater...
Jesus, look at this guy.
Forget it.
I just stopped in to say hi.
Hi... what's up?
Do you want something to drink?
Why not?
What? Why?
Since when is she an "actress"?
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
Did you sign up yet?
"Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
You know, the green cardigan guy.
Are you sure?
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
Not really...
We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking.
"Funky"?
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
Just promise you'll do it.
But those are our people...
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?!
Now are you going to get a regular job?
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
Just some people from work...
What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
I dunno...
What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?
It's really quite something to see you all grown up like this, Enid.  I'd love to hear about what you're doing. I can't help but feel that I had some small part in how you turned out...  What are you studying? You were always such a smart little girl.
May I ask what you're doing?
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
A what?
Do you have any other old records besides these?
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
Punk rock is over!
Go die, asshole!
Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.
Do you have any old Indian records?
This track alone by Memphis Minnie is worth about $500 if you have the original 78. She was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived, and a great singer and songwriter as well. I know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue.
God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.
I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!
I'm totally serious!
I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!
Wow! Look at all these creeps!
Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?
I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some --
What, like a girdle?
Wow!  What was that all about?
Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...
Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...
We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --
What are you doing here?
Where did you get this?
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
I'm just being realistic.
You know what my number one fantasy used to be?
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
I was just thinking out loud...  I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...
I really want to talk to you. I've been thinking about what you said about moving in here...
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
No... they said she was here...
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
I have no idea - I just want to...
Did she say that?
What do you mean?
I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.
It doesn't pay very much, but I should be able to afford my own place in a few months... Do you think that's too soon? I'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage...
Morning, friend, glorious day.
John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm Robert Beaumont.  Firm- I like that, tells me a lot about you-  -now why don't you tell me about me? To get you started, many people find me handsome, with a wonderful smile. I'm sure you agree.  Winning personality, heaps of charm?
In that half will be bait- human bait- I'll start things off-  -a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor.
I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, "don't get sick in front of it."  That was meant to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost the knack.
Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
Go, now.  Such a gentleman. 
Don't much like them.
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
...one shot...
How lucky we are.
All right- thee second embankment will go there. 
I'll try- but this feels so different- that old lion I killed could never carry off a man Singh's size.
Second death? Where?-
Got me out of trouble.
Have you got it?
Meant to ask you- the railroad car trap. Your idea?  Excellent notion- I used the same device myself once.
In my town, when I was little, there was a brute, a bully who terrorized the place.  But he was not the problem. He had a brother who was worse than he. But the brother was not the problem.  One or the other of them was usually in jail. The problem came when they were both free togther. The two became different from either alone.  Alone they were only brutes. Together they became lethal, together they killed.
They're used to people in trees, not in a clearing.  It may be tight.
It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.
Oh yes, I think so. 
He has children?
Where do you go next?
Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do.  Do I have bad breath or something?
Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
What do you want with my baby?
Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
What do you think?
That's where the buggy stopped.
Good luck.
Does she know anything about babies?
Hi, Ray.  It's good to see you.  Thanks for coming.
Can I help you?
I was trying to get that smelly green thing. The guys asked me to help out.  I'm like the fifth Ghostbuster.
It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
I command you.
They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
Can I have some of your water?
Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.
Yes, I did.  We were city champs.
"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"
You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.  Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.
So far so good.
Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
Rivers of the stuff!
So, no goat hooves, huh?
Who?  Who?  Who?
I love this.  We're onto something really big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to make some headlines with this one.
Careful, Winston.  He's a mean one.  And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're giving you twice the value with our special half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan.
You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
And now you're going to eat it?
This is what you do with your spare time?
Like a goat on garbage.
Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?
Now that's one ugly dude.
Are you telling me how to drive?
Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?
Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?
Oh, sure.  I'm getting used to this.
... and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there.
That's too bad.
There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
You must have gotten the last copy.
Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
What's he doing in my refrigerator.
He is the Destructor.
Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
This is going to cost you, you know.  Our fees are ridiculously high.
What's that got to do with it?
Did you see it?  What was it?
You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too.
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
And may I see this storage facility?
Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
All right.  What is it?
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?
Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
What on earth gave you that idea?
Oh!  You're here.
Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.
Trust me.  It will be bad.
It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.
Of course!  Ivo Shandor,  I saw his name in Tobin's SPIRIT GUIDE.  He started a secret society in 1920.
What now?
Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?
Set entry grid.
You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?
Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
I told you it's real.
You'll never regret this, Ray.
Wow!  Does this pole still work?
Everybody can relax.  I found the car.  How do you like it?
How was your date?
It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any.
I couldn't help it!  It just popped in there!
Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?
It's disgusting!  Animals!  I had to come here under armed guard.  Slaves -- get this junk out of my sight.
How about in the forum.  Right in front of the Senate.
Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
"... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..."
Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience?
And like children everywhere they scream "freedom" the most when they desire it least.  I beg you, please continue, Caesar.
Gladly, Caesar.  And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.
So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case...
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know.
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
I've read of it.
Is this Rome?  Are we just going to be executed?
Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
As soon as I can.
Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
Serious stuff...
On his death bed I promised Marcus I would complete our work here.  The Senate may be vacillating, but I have the army behind me.  I'm taking half a cohort and restocking that fort.
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
He's very realistic.
Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
General, hang on... drink slowly. You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician and a Divine of Janus with you tonight.  A fan sent them to you.
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
How much money is involved?
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
Let's talk about this later.  Right now we have other things to settle. You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia.  From there, Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum.  It's beautiful; an old Greek town right on the ocean.  Rich soil.  Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements... although Caesar will give you a sort of pension it's always good to look to the future, keep your hand in the arena... so to speak.
Aren't you eating?
What?
Listen -- could you stop crying, please?
Do you?
All right.
Don't cry. 
-- really incredible --
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
I said I think it is.
Let me go.
She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
Can I just sit here while you're packing?
What are you going to do now?
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
Oh no. He said that.
Ben.
Exactly how do you mean?
What are you then?
See -- she's just having some water. Now there's no need for the cops or anything.
Mr. McCleery?
Come to the railing and I'll hand it up.
Is anything wrong, sir?
Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?
Drink?
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
What is wrong with me?
Yes?
I think I'll go to bed.
Then why do you keep running away?
But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
Hello, Benjamin.
How are you?
May I have a drink?
Yes.
I got a single room.
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
Yes?
To tell you?
Wood or wire? They have both.
Thank you.
You what?
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
That you're afraid --
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
Oh my God.
Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
Do you really want me to?
What?
What?
Always?
How many times a year.
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
Well I can't.
What was your major?
Do you remember the make of the car?
Really. I want to know.
Do you understand that?
Good.
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It never occurred to me to take her out.
Braddock -- Braddock?
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
Nothing else.
I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?
I guess -- about my future.
Have you thought about graduate school?
Say that again.
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
Hello.
But why?
Yes?
I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
-- before he does --  You're disappointing them, Ben. You're disappointing them.
The Carlsons' are here.
Need any help?
How?
No -- no -- no -- no...
I've quit.
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
He must be very nice.
You?
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
What?
Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
Chasing around.
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
Flaemmchen, what are you doing here in the middle of the night.
You live here?
So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?
And then --?
Yes -- tired...
Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
I want to be alone.
Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping. We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet, in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest, no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous is alone... But why should I be telling you this? Last night I did not know you at all -- who are you, really? -- I do not even know your name.
You do believe that I really love you?
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.
Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.
I'm worried about you.
Thank you, sir.
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
And this is Doctor Otternschlag.
What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
Was the Baron joking, or is it really true that the Baron is -- in financial straits.
If we could scare up some men to play.
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
Well -- last night was not so good.
My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
Hello! Hello! --
For me?
For me?
The night clerk has already gone -- you are late.
Telegrams?
Anyone asked for me?
Oh!
Barman -- whiskey --  For you, Mr. Kringelein?
I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
If I could trouble the Baron to come and see this beautiful room. I have ordered champagne. Perhaps the Baroness could join us.
You may laugh. Caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me -- they mean a great deal. You see, I'm ill and all of a sudden I got a fear of missing life. I don't want to miss life -- do you understand?
I'm engaged for the evening.
Dance then? 
You must look at my face and not at the floor.
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
Moreover --
Tired?
What is this?
You...
You...
You're a little too fast.
I must go to England -- at once.
Oh, no.
And ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down.
I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.
Here's my signature -- here Preysing, sign here.
You're a deep one.
Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they were to break --
Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs.
Gru -- you are positively radiant.
He will be on the train.
How much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing.
What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.
Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I can't have shit like this.
No.
You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies.
It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...
He's a good kid. A salesman.
You're a thousand percent right!
And I'll want to leave an early wake-up call.
Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
Well, that's what the law's for, isn't it?
Not much time.
The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.
His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
Yes, yes, but that's --
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
What's up?
Sounds like a good Idea.
What? Me?
Perk, remember?
That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
They knocked out my tooth!
What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what?
You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.
That was my choice, nothing to do with you. I took a chance, and it didn't work out.
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.
I know what's bugging you, of course.
A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was.
If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?
That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...
There's nothing more to talk about.
You heard the shower, didn't you?
Let me see how you did that one.
Where's the five?
That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.
Roy?
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
Get well soon.
I don't see why we have to take the train.
What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?
No.
Upstate.
I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me.
Take a hike, you mean?
Think about it. Okay?
That's what I say.
Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. I've seen people like you before, baby. Double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. But you don't make it work forever.
Well, when you put it that way.
You take all your dates here. Blake?
Carter.
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
I'll be damned.
My god...
Another historical inaccuracy.
Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
It's an option.
Why didn't you tell me?
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
I'm not leaving without her.
There's something I have to tell you both.  It's going to sound strange...
You aced it, didn't you?
What's this?
Shane's going as a condom.
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
What if your parents come home?
Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
We need you, Dr. Loomis.
It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was Jamie.  Calling for me.
Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.  After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice.
There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
You've created a monster.
Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
Hm?
We've never met.
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
Can I have the Cadillac?
I've been looking at motorcycles.
Otherwise, how are things?
Could have happened to anybody.
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
I didn't know we had any women left.
I wanted to apologize.
I can't get over how you guys are my friends.  Harold Ryan and Looseleaf Harper are my friends.
Blue soup.
Fifty years?
Who's going to fly our helicopter now?
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
You were about to ask a question?
I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille--
We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
Play?
What kind of exercise?
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
You don't even know me.
Now that's what I call fun.
Now--turn around, if you would.
Breakfast?
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
That's what you're supposed to say.
Fish can't feel.
Such as?...
You learned this in some college course?
And no one's there now?
A dozen?
Did you like it, dear?
Well--what have we here?  A family.
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
The door ws unlocked.  Is it always unlocked?
You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes.
I feel the same way.  What next?
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
I thought she was a widow.
There's a certain amount of information there.
This is man to man.
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
You're old--so old.
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
I love you!  Have a cigar!
No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
Don Quixote.
You're too modest.
Was I ever of use?
My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it.  It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.
Alice got married again.
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
For what?
Who's dead?
What happened?
Something's made you sore.
I worship your father.  That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he shot?  It's the proudest thing in my apartment.
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
A what kind of doctor?
Is Norbert still here?
Mom?
I don't get it.
That's why I'm crying.
Peace, everybody--Paul, Penelope.
He isn't?
I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.
For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
Possibly.
I'm saying no--and thank you.
I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace--
If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.
You know each other?
You've got to fight from time to time.
Start with the smallest weights. Every week add a pound or two.
If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities.
I just want to ask some questions.
Man, how many girls do you need?
Are you still going with that fella that teaches at Grand Valley?
Kristen went on that convention today, didn't she?
The other girl is the star?
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
Are you Niki?
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
Joanne?
No. I saw her with Tod.
Where's he?
You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?
Is that the way it was with you?
No.
Why? Are you a sex fiend?
How important do you think sex is?
What the crap?
I'll admit it's confusing from the outside. You've got to see it from the inside.
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about...
Those cops, like all cops, are intelligent enough, but they are masters of de-ductive reason. That is, you ask them what three and two are they'll tell you five, but if you ask them what five is, they go blank. That's spec-u-lative reasoning, and that's where I come in.
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
You are.
Yeah. You ever seen any of those?
They're legal now.
Where is she?
I bought it at a store in L.A.
I don't know.
The police? They know less than you do.
Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you belong.
But this is my apartment.
Do the police want to arrest me?
Where'd you hear that name?
You know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. You can buy child whores, slaves. You can have people raped, killed...  One of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named Ratan. He usually isn't in this country.  How'd you hear about him?
Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money...
You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
What happened?
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
You're talking about real excitement?
I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, of course. Just helping out a friend. It'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening.
Meet me here today at seven o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film.
You wait here. I'll find out where she is.
You don't want anything for your fifty cents?
No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.
Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
I thought you were a businessman.
Granville's looking for you anyway.
Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
You are at the University, Candy?
Yes.
Come again.
Lady, let me get this straight.
Okay, lady. Out.
Haven't we met before?
But there is a family resemblance.
A block of ice.
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
Do you dance?
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
You don't look eighty.
Well, it's all very thrilling, of course, but I ask you, Harold... Is it enough?
I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so <u>tall</u> and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
What?
We'll come back in the morning.
What were you fighting for?
I think he's following us.
Well, I really don't smoke.
I'm sure picking up on vices.
Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
No. I'd feel stupid.
It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."
But they'll put me in jail.
Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate!  Really, sir, I thought that you at least...
Oh, you weren't scared.
How about some candy floss?
Look at the stars.
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
Farewell?
I feel giddy.
Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
How do you do?
Is Sunshine your real name?
And why is that?
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
No.
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging.  Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do for <u>fun</u>? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?
None at all?
Your classmates?
Then why did you leave?
They came at me from all sides, hundreds of 'em. We kept firing - Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat! "Throw the grenades," I shouted. "Mac, throw the grenades!" "He's dead," Joe said, and kept right on feeding me bullets.  Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat!  They kept falling, but they kept coming. Bullets whizzing all around me. Zot! Joe falls back with a neat red hole in his head. I thought I was done for. But I kept firing. Zat-Tat-Tat! Only one thought kept me going. Kill! Kill! For Mac, and Joe, and the rest of the guys. Kill! - a blinding flash. I wake up on a stretcher. "Did we hold?" I asked the medic. "Yes, sir," he said, and I slipped into unconsciousness.
Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
How about to slit his throat?
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Were you also the one who painted the statues?
Well, I didn't.
Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it.
Well, well. All my family together again. How very sweet.
He... he loved me.
I want to go back!
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
No bad dreams.
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
Who?
Nah -- he's taken care of.
You were burned by some organic acid.
Red. How long was it latched onto you?
That's all for you, Sammy.
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real --
She's dead.
Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: "The crossroads."  And crossroads I have become.  Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key.
We've installed a very handy timer. Set it, walk away. Cable pulls the safety pins, K-boom! Easy to clean, easy to use...
Thank you.
Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you.
Helping you -- I just --
Nah, sounds too "needy."
Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...
What about you?
Hello, I'm --
Yes, I --
Pardon?
What's happening?
Will you sign for the bed?
Oh.
Suppose he HAD slipped us. What significance has that?
We want the man who did this --
Just in time.
Kirsty. It's Frank. It's Uncle Frank.
I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you? Beautiful.
You bastard --
Frank --
Well?
Wedded bliss?
I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.
It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
Don't you care?
How long since you were here?
You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll love it.
Larry!
You're NOT going to faint.
Maybe a brandy.
Huh?
Drinking alone.
I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
You wouldn't believe me.
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you?
I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
Are you O.K.?
What are you drinking, love?
Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
No you don't.
What do we do if there isn't?
I've been better.
These THINGS... they want to take me --
What did I say?
You gotta be kidding me.
Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that?  None, no chance.  That's just fate.
I wanna date a musician...
What did you tell her about the shop for?
What are you snickering about?
Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
Just... come on, what would it mean to you?  That sentence? "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?"
I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.
...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
Shut the fuck up, Barry.
Hey.
None.  Christ!
Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
What's up?
It was Jan, and it was a long time after--
Like fuck you are.
Great.  Can I have it then?
No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
That's what I said.
A couple blocks!  About six!
I can't go to the club tonight, guys.
Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean...
Hey, Barry.
What are you talking about?
What I mean is, I didn't mean you look young.  You don't.  You don't look old either.  You look just as old as you are.  A bit younger maybe, but not a lot.  Not much.  Just right.
Right.  So.  You must have an enormous record collection.
Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
'Morning, Dick.
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
Are you all right?
I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever.
-- Made.  Made.  Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --
Yes.  Look at me.  Look at our -- the apartment.  What else do I have, other than records and CDs?
So.  Where have you been staying for the last week?
I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair to you.  That's why I came here to the store this evening.  I feel terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, you know.
Yeah.  Great.
No problem.  If I can ask one question.
Never?
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana?  Maybe a Liz Phair track.  There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff.  The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you...  But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there.  Ah.  Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan.  Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings.  He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.
I'm sure.
You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
Look, we can do other things.
How?  How were we the same people?
But what?
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself.  Otherwise, what's the use?
Hi.
You did that deliberately.  You knew all along I'd like them.  It was a trick.
Just local, of course.
I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk.  I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't.
What are you going to talk to me about?
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will.
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
Is Ray going?
So you live in Chicago now?
She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing.  A relief, actually.
Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...
Are you okay?
So you'll stay?
Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?
That way.
I knew this was going to happen.
What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
Look.  Can I pay you properly?  You don't have to tell him what you got. Send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest.  Give it to charity.  Or something.
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.
I can't figure out why he's doing it. He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967.  And the guys rich.  You should see the stuff he has in that shop.
Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?
Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...
You're very macabre.
Happy birthday.
Taupin, Richard Marshall.  Born March 16, 1945 in Church Hill, Maryland.  Received first driver permit 1967 in Philadelphia.
No.
You're wrong.
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
Yes.
What is it?
Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school.
Forgers do it all the time.  They take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit I.D.  Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it.
I'm calling an attorney.
You talked to your supervisor lately?  He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight.  That on top of the cops bugging him.
Hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, I'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here.
It is as you are.
Why?
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
Impotent cow.
The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
You're no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez.  We're raised as riders.
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
Complete your inspection?
Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last.
I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke.
Are you sure?
Where!
The last four.
How are you?
And have you something to settle with me?
I haven't drunk this much since-
No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
What's the point!  You have me, finish it!
Yes laddie, I have her.
Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way.  He'd also been in the country less than a week.  What is your citizenship?
Do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh- borhood at night?
It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
Home.
Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea.
Ah Steven, it is good to see you.
When your father died I saw to it that the grounds were kept up.
You're one of William's kids, huh?
Nothing to be sorry about.
I got my rhyming dictionary in -- 
I'll keep you in mind.
I said -- uh -- I said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you.
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
Oh, it isn't like that.
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?
Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
Hildy! Where's mother?
Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, here's your wallet. I got it back.
This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.
But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
Well, so you're getting married tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?
Anything the matter?
I feel I ought to take care of her.
Well, I'm independent, too.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again.
Hildy!
No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office. 
I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman, after all.
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.
Get out!
No? Well --  Johnson, you're under arrest.  You, too, Burns.
You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed.  "-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.
Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.
Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
Sure you can. Come on.
What do you mean by that?
Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
What tricks would I pull?
We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
Listen, did you impress it on Butch that I want him and his gang here right away? You did? Every minute counts. All right.  Duffy's getting old!
Well, keep going! We want an extra out on the streets before it's too late!
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello?  I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em!  Duffy!  Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation!  Duffy!!
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
Wait a minute!  Let go there!
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
Hildy!
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
But, Hildy -- I can explain --
Are you referring to me, Madam?
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
Well, that about covers everything.
I call. What you got?
Hey!
She looks as though she's going to come to.
She says she's gonna write fiction.
Come on, you! Before we slap you down.
I'll call.
Gus, this --
Same way you did.  Through that gate.
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
Just one second --
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago!
Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!
What is it?
No -- don't out me off.
That's a lie!!
Walter, I can't tell you how badly I feel about this. There was no excuse for Hartwell to fly off the handle.
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm retired. I'm one of you fellas now -- a newspaper man.
Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!
Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?
Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.
Have you got my dough?
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
Any dope yet on how he got out?
Mother!
Mother!
Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from here.
How'd you get here, Earl?
Where are they gone? You know where they are?
What's that?
I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
What's the idea?
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
Pinkus.
You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has to do.
They wouldn't take it.
Well, well -- Miss Mollie Malloy.
What's your hurry?
Who? Hildy Johnson? She just stepped out. She'll be back in a second. Who? Oh, Mr. Baldwin. Well, if you'll hang on a minute, she ought to be right in. All right. 
Want to know why they're called Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?
You miserable little tripe-hound. I'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school.
I never was.
Well go on then. You can't join if you can't answer.
Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Who with?
You're the biggest fibber.
You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
What did we know? We were seventeen.
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
Except the servicemen.
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
So you're going to be a grandfather.
I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer.
I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.
Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own.
Any cone, yeah...  I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.
Oh, I know. I'll show you where it's at, sweetie. Aren't you just so cute all bundled up like a cinnamon roll of Christmas love.
The lions were totally covered in this guy's blood... I think they ate his face off, tore open his rib cage, pulled his legs off... it was a wild scene.
Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.
I guess I'll try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road.
Is your brother ready to go?
Thank you.
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
I'd like to see that.
Wondering what?
What the hell are you laughing about?
Why? You gonna do something about it?
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
Come on, bro. Let's go.
There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.
Perfect.
Holy crap. You gotta see this place. It's awesome.
Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to.
It's a hitchhiker.
That reminds me of a film I saw once of a guy who got out of his car at Lion Country Safari to take a picture of a lion cub and got eaten by the lions.
I hope you fixed the spare like I asked ya.
Don't forget the flashlight, it's pretty dark out there.
I like sleep.
Honk at him. Scare him.
Fuck! We are fucked!
Forget it. I'll just go.
Drive through it!
Christ, ain't they all. All them retards wanna do is fuck and eat.
Goddamn.
How long is that gonna take?
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
Fuck, it's freezing.
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
Yeah?
So what?
That was good babe, just keep doing that.
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
Geez, he never gets tired does he.
I think I'm going fucking crazy.
I still don't.
What'd we here, Georgie?
Oh, right.
No, no, no it's so much more special than that... you'll see, you'll be the first to ever see. I think this is something you'll really love.
I'm gonna go ask him.
That stupid hillbilly slut.
I know you're my guests and welcome but I'd please advise you to keep from cussing while in my house, thank you.
Why? Why are you doing this?
Behold... The Fish-Boy!
Please, just a minute.
I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy... 
Mr. Willis?
Your Spidey senses tingling.
You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
Fine.
What is it?
Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong.
That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.
Very well.
You what?
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you.
I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.
I'm going to miss you.
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
I like you so much, with or without hair.  But don't spread that around. Bad for business.
As do I.
Boy, this is good!
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!
Flares?
Did you see that?
...what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human? Think of this poor soul's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon...
Do you like my new look?
How's work?
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
Bravo to you, Puff!
I think he's ready.
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
So he's doing okay?
I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem.
Puff, why don't you say a few words to the assemblage.
It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I'm an ape like dad was...  And I have to go back into the woods now... forever.
Yes.
Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady.
You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.
I want to talk to you.
In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?
That seems a shame. The night is young.
Will you take a check, Bert?
Character.
No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
I never saw you do anything else.
Man named Turk Baker?
Sign up.
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
Here, I got it.
You know, that's real sweet music in there. You can almost smell the action and the money. You know, I can feel it right down in the bottom of my shoes.
Aren't you gonna go over and talk to him?
So does Eddie.
I can beat him.
Fifty per cent?
Maybe. You want to play?
Who's he?
You got that wrong, mister. I am.
You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
Why?
Well... well, now.
Hey, how much are we ahead?
Go to hell.
Is this all we got left?
What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
Findley.
Hi.
Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.
Okay, friend. You're on.
Have a nice trip?
It's the lights. And the scotch.
Yeah? What do you do now?
You don't look like a college girl.
Hey!
How did you know my name was Sarah?
You were asleep when I left. I didn't want to wake you. Did you go out?
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
No, why should I? It's yours.
No. You?
I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.
He's a gambler.
You know, someday, Sarah, you're gonna settle down. You're gonna marry a college professor, and you're gonna write a great book. Maybe about me, huh? Fast Eddie Felson, hustler.
Well, what's so funny?
No, I want to walk.
Go on back to the hotel.
And them fingers, them chubby fingers. And that stroke. It's like he's, uh, like he's playing a violin or something.
Very good shot.
That is not now, human!
Are you all right?
Good evening.  Did you have a pleasant day today?
I know, son.  But you'll like it where we're going.  I'm getting a good job.  It's a pretty part of the country.
Wow.  Look at the mountains.
There are more this year than last.
Which one's that?  The dull, red one.
Are you all right, Dad?
What did he talk to you about?
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
Where, Jimmy?
No one comes here after dark.
Damn.
But you saw -- the men go under the sand ...
What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?
Your father asked you a question.
Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
This could be our last night on Earth. I don't want to die a virgin.
David? How'd you get this number?
And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
I don't know how you put up with him.
There's good news and bad news.
Yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. When I find the exact binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely...
Spunky?
Pops, you're a genius!
I have a confession to make. I'm not real big on flying.
Get us out of here!
With your permission, Mr. President, I'd like to remain my your side.
General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command. Tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can.
Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?
And our forces?
With their shields down it might be possible.
A meteor?
Be careful.
Really? You don't mind?
Jasmine has this thing for dolphins. I had them make it...
Stevie... I can't...
I'm not leaving.
Where do your people come from?  Where is your home?
Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
My reputation precedes me.
May we go home now, please?
Dad?
Ah, Venice...
Marcus -- I've seen this window before.
Marcus!
Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?
Are you expected?
Tapestries?
My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.
Where did this come from?
An old man's dream.
Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!
Fraulein -- will you permit me?
Bingo.
What are you going to do?
Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika.
But what are you doing here?
No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.
...you did it.
You did!!
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
No! Don't Shoot!
Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
What did you get?
Well, I'm as human as the next man.
Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
I didn't know you could fly a plane.
Dad, are we hit?!
Nice landing.
Those people are trying to kill us!
Uh-huh.
I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.
Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
All right! Where's my father
Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?
Well, Mr. Prime Minister, my report will duly note that we found nothing unusual here in Pankot.
Interested in local curios?
Charming.
I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors.  What was it they claimed was stolen?
I've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't have let somebody like Willie go in there with me.
Miss Scott, you're not making any sense.
I would say you look rather lost.  But then I cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home...
I had a question, Mr. Prime Minister. I was examining some of the Maharajah's artifacts.
I was dubious myself at first. Then something connected -- the village's rock and the old legend of the Sankara Stones...
That was a misunderstanding.
Dr. Jones.
I ride with you, Indy?
Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks!
You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones.
There were five stones in the beginning. Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you...
Give me the stones!
No, the stones are mine!
It is Pankot Palace that kills my village.
But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?
I'm freezing. What do you mean, tag along? From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me.
Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
Indy! Help me!
A what...?
Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now.
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.  Fortune and glory...
Couldn't keep away, huh?
That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!
Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?
No -- don't you see -- crawling --
Oh no -- oh no!!
WILLIE?!
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!
Indy? Did you talk to them?
Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!
I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
The last Sankara Stone.
Figures...
I said something.
Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
You're not crazy.
Of course you do!
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
I'll tell you what to say.
Calm Down! Act rational.
They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
Now what.
A lab and equipment.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
That's not a good idea.
Gone where?
You need ID in there?
I'm back.
...and a license to kill...
They'll know who I am.
Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while.
Beautiful!
This must be business, there's nothing else here.
Help me out, will you?
Touch her.
Without your pants.
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
What is it?
Not that tie with that coat.
What Happened?
And on my time.
Better. I found Ryuji.
Sapporo..
Relax. Make your mind a blank.
I can't...
What are you doing?
Door to the right. Get up and run.
He was with Gruner!
It's him.
Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
He hung us up dry.
There's a lot you don't know.
Do something.
I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.
They have stolen state property.
If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study.
You didn't tell us you were coming?
You have nothing...
Bit expensive, sir.
What are you doing here, where've you been?
And...you know Jan Gruner?
When you do...
Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
What?
Let you leave without it.
Wait. What's your name?
...and sort of...disinterest.
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
No. Ryuji just hires us.
Joe! What happened to you?
Why did you leave?
Why did you stay with me?
Why?
Who else is interested in me?
Why did they leave?
Were you working for him last night?
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
We're very close.
Then why are you smiling like that?
What's Gruner like?
And Dieter.
And you?
Now what?
What?
What a mess.
How?
Uh...wonderful. I know I'm strange, but in my own way, I love you
He can't help us.
Come on.
What could you find in this place?
Excuse me?
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
Is there anything else?
Yes.
Right there.
It'l take months.
That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it?
Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon.
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
P.J.'s.
Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
These are their leads, their sources. I want you to have your reporters...
Shit...
You're exaggerating!
The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us!
I'm afraid you are.
Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?
Debbie...
Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike... but, if it did. And we aired this segment? And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson? I think we could be at grave risk.
What's going on?
...taping?  What are you taping?
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
Let me see this... No, 'cause I gotta know where you're going at all times.
Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye. 
Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?
It would be better if he called us.
Thank you for saying that...
Lowell.
Lowell!
Did I get you up?
How do you like your coffee? Black?
...but that's as far as I go...
Should I just take the documents now?
This is my house... In front of my wife, my kids?! What business do we have?
And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage.  ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it.
Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement?
Seven dwarfs?
I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.
The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
Why?
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
I don't know how to say this, Jeff, except to just say it right out, so I'll say it. They do not want to air it.
B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block...  But you, I mean, I know how...
Oh, you know what we do or do not need to know? Since when have you become a media expert?
...I was young. I was young... confused... We didn't handle it the right way...
Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?
ABC Telemarketing Company.
Did he hear you?
What about now?
Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all.  You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry.  So, what were you calling about?
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...
Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you...  ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky! That means you don't talk!  Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...
My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
Jail?
Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you --
Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.
So she's uh, flourishing?
Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?
Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
He's the wrong man.
I have it.
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
It was like that scene in The Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is called to testify against the Family. And he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his Brother. They brought the brother from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a word. He can't testify. That's what it was like seeing Pat in there. I couldn't even have Ruth cross examine her.
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
You're vulnerable.
You said 'yes' didn't you?
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
What is it you're after, Miles?
A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting.
And here I thought my mother was...
We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe...
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
But?
Hardly. You have six bedrooms
Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
Good.  Are those foods?
Miles. I have a very good relationship with all the salesmen. I can return everything.
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
I fell in love Miles.
Hello Marylin.
Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
You wounded me first, Marylin.
Pre-Castro.
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
I was devastated. Of course.
Who's that?
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
So. Now what?
You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow?
Wow.
Who's she?
I don't know what his game is. He dismissed every one of Ruth's proposals. And Sarah, we weren't unreasonable.
Lilly's up.
So what?
You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
Ha Ha.
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
Where does that leave us?
Time marches on. Ardor cools.
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
And she had private investigators assisting her.
And she has...?
What the hell is wrong with you?
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish.
That doesn't make sense. It's like punishing you for being goal oriented.
We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.
I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her.
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in
That's an evasion.
What's this about not eating?
You ought to know why. Because
Smart, aren't you! So subtle.
Where are you taking me?
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
I knocked several times.
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'mI'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questionsI  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him?
Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
I'd like to have a talk with him.
Yes, I guess I have.  I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous.  Besides, what difference does it make?  I'll never see Peter again.
On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last?
You talk as if
Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for meand maybe we'll be friends  Maybe.  Do we understand each other?
We've done that already.
What happened?
Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much.  We shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New Yorkand if we didn't go, she might lose it.
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.
Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
Take my advicegrab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony.
I never thought of that.
If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.
Of course I do. What do you mean
A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going?
High time you got back.
Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
It takes money to buy food.
I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
What's the matter?
You think it's simple, huh?
Eat a carrot.
What'd you give him for the car?
What about money?
That's swell!
There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart.
How are you, Ellie?  Are you happy?
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
In about fifteen minutes.
Hey, what's this? Wearing Papa's things? Now that's cute. That's what I call real lovey-dovey. Yessir.
Collect?
What's the thousand bucks for?
You!
I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute.  I'm in love with her, Joe.
Listen, manI'll tell you what I'll do. When I come back in the morning, I'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit? What do you say?
What?
What do you reckon that's for?
But what in the world do they want a trumpet for?
Mebbe.
Thenyou'll have to git !
Well, you're two up on me now. 
What's the idea?
Wife?
I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
If you don'tEver hear of Bugs Dooley?
Gee! That musta been terrible.  I guess he had it coming to him though. But don't you worry about me. I don't talk. I never talk. Take my word for it. Gee, I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids.
Boss, Oswald impersonators?  Sounds like James Bond now.
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
What was his voice like?
Did he pay?
A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
Who the hell opened my files!  You've been looking through my private files, haven't you, you weasel?
Maybe there's more to this, Susie. The CIA's keeping something from our enemies.
Or a cover up!  Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?
Who do you think fed him that information?  Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life.  You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing.
Correct me if I'm wrong.  I thought we were on the same side.  What the hell business is it of theirs to say that?
What do you think, Lou?
You know you keep saying that.
Fuck, yes.  Hell, I'm already in jail.  I got no reason to lie to you.  I ain't no nigger.
What the hell's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister's?
Lord, wake me, please.  I must be dreaming.
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!
...Oswald?
Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects.  I can't go home. I'm out on the street.  The maggots are everywhere!  Do you know what you've done to me?  It's all over the national news now.  You know what you've done to me?
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
Dave, I always play square.  No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I"m in no hurry.  Whenever you're ready.
What about the mob, Dave?  How do they figure in this?
No, I never saw him before in my life.
We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
Let me get this straight, now.  Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?
And Shaw?
Then who killed the President?
Colonel Finck, are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck?
No.
No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
That's our case!
I'm scared.
These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.
We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?
If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right?  It proves he's a liar.  Keep on it, Bill. 
I'm sorry.
Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?
Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald?
Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy, that this company was a creature of the CIA for the transfer of funds in Italy for illegal political-espionage activities.  It says that this company was expelled from Italy for those activities.
Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.
Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
Get a hold of yourself.
Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey."  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not "fine" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.
You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.
Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died. 
I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
Who do you think changed the parade route?
General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw.
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
I don't... I can't believe it.  They killed him because he wanted to change things.  In our time - in our country?
How much more?
You have other information?
Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say. 
Didn't someone say he didn't speak good Russian?
I don't think so, Al.  You remember the Hemingway story, "The Old Man and the Sea"?  The old fisherman manages to catch this great fish - a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back in.  But by the time he reached shore, the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton.
Welcome, Mr. Miller.  Jim Garrison. Would you care for some coffee?
How many men are working with you on this?
I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.
And you get of from school at 3 every day?
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.
Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
Uh-huh.
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --
Does he have the marked bills on him?
What's going on?
What's she willing to give us?
Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking.
But now you're telling us now you do.
Can we stop for cigarettes?
I'd love one, but not there.
What did they want to know?
You get a chance to use it?
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
He told me last night.
Who was your girl before Annette?
Why?
You talk them into it?
Bring the money in and they follow it?
You don't actually do it that way?
Has he hinted around?
A lot of reasons. But the main one would be I'm tired of it.
Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail bondsman.
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
Got another gun and a stun gun...
Did you do it that night?
And is that it?
If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
The feds. It's evidence.
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
How'd you find out?
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
I didn't use you, Max.
Where're you going?
I thought you were tired of your business?
You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
What if I plead guilty?
Yes'm.
Oh, Miss Brown?
And what would this be, Sweet and Low?
Look, that shit ain't mine.
Oh, so now you know him?
The envelope contains ten thousand dollars. The subject will be delivering the currency in a...
...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
Not yet.
She didn't say.
You didn't count it?
Ever been tempted?
Yes. All those things are true.
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
You took the time to pay the saleswoman.
We had our agent on you. She sees a blonde come out of the fitting room carrying a Robinson's/May bag and tussle with a tough-looking white guy. The white guy takes the shopping bag and they go.
If it'll make you happy.
I'm waiting for the phone.
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.
He said he didn't know about it.
It looks good on you.
I got some vodka in the freezer.
I'magine they asked who you givin' it to, too.
What do you think it is?
Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do with you. I just carry that. You been listenin' to them cops too much.
Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
I don't know. One of your friends.
Can you cover that?
I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.
I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
It's boring, isn't it?
Is it ready to go?
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
I thought you were sixteen.
That was taken at a place called "Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. back then?
I lived there for about nine months.
Is it dead?
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
What are you doin'?
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.
Guess where I am?
Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.
She believed you?
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
You shot Melanie?
You couldn't just hit her?
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
Then what?
I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses, I'm givin' you reasons.
I'm going out for a few hours.
It's in my bag.
Getting there.
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
I can see that. Why?
Somebody already did.
You didn't hear?
Brown, Jackie Brown.
Where is it?
You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her?
Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd already tried to get Jackie to go in with her, split the half million amongst themselves. What she did was take quite a risk to see you get your money.
My office.
She was afraid.
It's in the safe. She can't get at it.
It's the next street.
My money's in that office, right?
Hope you don't mind keeping him company.
Cherry Bail Bonds.
He ain't here right now.
He's around.
Let me out of here!
Daddy!
You have an unusual hand.
You know, you got a strange line here.
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
Come on, Professor. The army's not gonna give you any answers. You'll be buttin' your head against a stone wall.
I know you. How come you're so tense today?
I saw Sarah the other day.
What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
Jake, you need to rest.
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
Ah!
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
I know very little about demons, Ja- cob, fleshy ones anyway. I know them as literary figures, biblical ones ... Dante, Milton ... but Jacob,  this is the 20th Century. We don't see demons now.
Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit?
If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?
I'm not cold.
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.
Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife.
It's still there, Jake.  Even if you never say a word about it. You can't spend two years in Vietnam ...
Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos and bag ladies. Low life. That's all they are. The streets are crawling with 'em. Don't make em into somethin' they're not.  It's the pressure, honey. That's all it is.
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
Oh, come on. It's early.
What's it say? A hundred and two?
What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
He's coming right over.
Help me! Help me!
How come? The army?
Are you out of your mind?
This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.
Bullshit!
Where are they?
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
What's going on?
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
Oh?  Where you going?
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Where have they gone?
This isn't happening.
Oh God!
WHO ARE YOU?
Anyway, this big offensive was coming up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. Morale was down. It was gettin' ugly in the States. Hell, you remember.
I always suspected the effects might come back. That's why I had to follow you. I had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.
"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
I can't move.
How 'bout over there?  No wait. Do me a favor. Bring 'em to the back room.
No. I'll take the other one.  Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.
Clear the area. This is an order!
I'll page him.
I'm sorry.
Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick.
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous.
That's as straight as I can put it. And don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to Hell. They're comin' after me.
Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I was coming apart at the seams.
A car accident.
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
Do you want me to get someone?
Is he all right?
On top of him?
He's not part of the program.
Duck fuckers?
Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.
Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
Where the hell were you?!!
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.
Earth II.
Get them in the lab!
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it.
We need weapons.
Kicker, anything?
Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future. We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to.
We're screwed!
Hey.
My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology is part of the business. We happen to get along just fine, smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's balls for a change.
Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going.
Got it.  You ever space walked?
Rizzo, you okay?
You okay?!
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.
It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
Now that's just gross.
Now this is getting exciting.
This is what it means right here.
I'm gonna spew.
Hurry! She's lost it!
Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
I don't know...sorry?
The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back.
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
Yo, Teach, what the fuck?
I don't understand...what does he want?
Something's wrong.
The power's back up!
I gotta go back.
Where..? Who . . .?  I'm alive. You brought me back.
How did I get here, how did you bring me back?
Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...
Jason? He's on this ship?!
He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.
Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there...
It's my charter. My party.
Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there?
Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.
He's trying to sink us!
He's chasing us! I don't believe it.
How come the sun didn't used to shine in here?
Sexy, hm? What was I before?
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
Who's that young man?
She's right.
We have got to close the beaches. We have got to get someone to kill the shark, we need non-corrosive mesh netting, we need scientific support... It's gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have.
I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead.
...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence.
What's that?
If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him.
You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?
I'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! There are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply...
What day is this?
You picked her up on the ferry.
Think she might've run out on you?
Polly told me to tell you there's a scout troop in Avril Bay doing the mile swim for their Merit Badges. I couldn't call them in, there's no phone out there.
My husband tells me you're in sharks.
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
Well... is everything all right?
What have you got there, Lenny?
Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait.
Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
20 feet, if it's an inch...
Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off.
I'll drink to your leg.
...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice -- your first and your last.
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.
We're getting a stretch limo.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
You're being really immature.
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
Why?
You know it's okay.
What, you mean as friends?
You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Hey man.
What a trip, man.
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
What? I'm not made of stone.
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.
Oh, God...
No.
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.
Wow, dream big!
What? My eyes are not lying!
Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.
So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.
Oh really? What's the verdict?
Cute?
Wow, I actually feel like less of a fat dork now.
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
Juno! Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know. It can feel pain. And it has fingernails.
Can I take your coats?
Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking.
Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.
Mark? Why is Juno crying?
My partner uses these every time we have intercourse. They make his balls smell like pie.
Okay, this is no laughing matter.
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
Check out Baby Big-Head. That kid is scary!
Touche.
Aw, please Junebug?
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.
What do you make with that?
You guys are playing music?
Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
I called Gerta Rauss. She says she can represent both of us. They call it "collaborative divorce." It's apparently all the rage right now. And it's easy because we don't have children.
Have you found a place to stay?
You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
What?
I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
What if they're dangerous?
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
Where you from Walter?
Tight fit.
Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and Adele haven't had time for breakfast, Early.
So what do you do Early?
Now why is that?
Yeah?
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
You two been busy in here.
Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.
Okay, now you want to talk about good versus evil? Well then let's start with Adam and Eve and the snake.
Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral.
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around.
You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?
Up yours.
What is it?
Carrie... stop it.
...never?
Early, just think...
Could be.
How many times have you gone unprotected?
With how many people?
Well, girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections.
And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby.
I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit.
I mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
Shit.
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.
I hate this game.
She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her.
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
Yeah. Why you give money.
Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.
Casper, where is he?
Casper! Was up kid?
You goin'?
I'm goin'. You on the list?
You sure?
Man we fucked him up.
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all.
Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me.
Who are they?
What is it?
Because your a virgin?
You know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise.
Telly is at Steven's?
How old are you?
The test isn't one hundred percent accurate. You should...
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
Did you bleed?
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
You know... You know a lot of times sex gets in the way. Has that ever happened to you?
Yep.
Yep. That's the best way. It's that boom boom boom.
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
Oh shit.
And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.
How can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
Where does everyone sleep?
What man? What is it?
I can't man.
What's that supposed to mean?
You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?
That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that.
Of course it was.  Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering.  That's a felony.
We're interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there.
What do you think?
The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  I think he's a first- timer.
I spoke to Jeremy.  He's watching Sanderson's kid.  Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since.
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.
Don't fuck with us!  Where did you go!
Remember eventually revenge is carefully...  Have you tired juxtaposing the words?
Very amateurish, Peter.  I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic.  I'm not an idiot!  Don't treat me as one!  I'll call you everyday... You get one minute, whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you!  Are you ready to play?
To get your attention.
And -- what path is that?
You'll find her.
Hello?
Just like who?
Hello, Peter.
Yes?
It's me you want.  Not her.
No problem.  We're in.
Feeling better?
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
Is your dad here?
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
Don't you have something you want to say to David?
You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.
It isn't Kathy.
How long has she been dead?
He tapes their mouths shut.  We found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths.  We're doing a chemical analysis for components, but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store.
This is where he forced his way in.  We found some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. I'll know more once I get it under the microscope.
How long she been dead?
No.  I told him to.  I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end.
That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.
You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
What time did he get there?
Did you see his face?
Mister Sanderson, this is Doctor Sheppard.  She's a psychologist helping us out.
He's not going to give us direct hints. He's going to skirt around it.
Answer the question.
You opened with the English.  Lutz won't use it.  He opened his first game with it.
Peter...
What do you see here?
Are you one of the players?
Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives.
I'm just curious.
Relax.
I know it was bad.
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
I'm hungry.
In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart?
Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
You're going to be late for your match.
Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
Where is the Fortress?
You will go alone.
But it opens onto the sheer wall of the Needle. There's no way down.
I am too old to climb down a rope.
There is nothing.
She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.
The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
From here, I must go alone.
They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ...
You must move quickly. The Beast will stop at nothing now.
How did you know?
Even by you?
Try your tricks on me and I'll turn myself back into a snake and bite you.
They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.
And where do you lead, boy?
Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.
We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise.
You!
What is that awful looking place?
Quell?
My heart stays here.
What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...
Oh, my poor stew!
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
We seek the Fortress of Krull.
The new King.
It is the time.
I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.
Yes.
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
Few have survived it.
Kegan!
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.
Give me his name, I will mail him.
I can't believe it! "Yes I think"... How she kids me! I can't believe it!  And did he pass your threshold or not?
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
...Good...  But what's special in him?
Tell me... The money I earn and you keep for me...
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
Take...
OK, I'm fine.
The fat man down there, on the bench.
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
What's up? I don't feel you're concentrated.
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
May I go to the cinema?
Not taken.
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, I make you notice.
Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
How shall we get out now, Leon?
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
...Composer.
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife?  Crushed her like a bug.  Snapped her bones?
What steps do we take now?
Yes -- you are.
I know what you're getting at.
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
Just for curiosity sake that's all?
You thought I sent them?
The new store?
It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself.
Your father?
From where?
Why?
Most certainly.
Red flag, man.
It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.
A marriage certificate?  Who the hell carries their marriage certificate around?
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.
This story is big huh?
Umm, he's going to make it isn't he?
What happened?
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
Are you firing me?
The hairs on my arm are standing up... Something strange is happening.
Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help.  But I'm not risking your life.
... My father.
Where did he go?
How are you feeling?
If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell.  I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.
What do you want?
No alcohol. You gotta get something else. Everything's ten dollars. What do you want?
Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
Sparkling apple cider?
Water?
Are you working?
You're pretty drunk.
What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?
I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
Yes.
I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later.  The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
How long have I been here?
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
Hi!
Why?
Why don't you go back to sleep. I'll go out and buy us some breakfast.
What was that all about?
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
Maybe it's time I moved to a hotel.
I don't want this. Yuri, please. I really don't want this. You know I don't like to do groups.
Don't hit me.
I loved him!
Brooke, I believe you. But a jury is gonna want an alibi.
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
I have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the Brooke's Butt Buster workout.
What's going on?
Dewey Newcomb?
Huh?
What are you talking about?
You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
You're hitting on me?
I'm sorry?
Yes?
-- his life?
After you went to all that trouble?
What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
Could I be anymore goddamn spastic?  So you're sure, this Warner guy is "the one"?
Good one.
And after they set his nose, he came back for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on pain-killers and we spent the whole afternoon together! He was unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun!
I'm a bitch.
You're pawning The Rock?!
Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?
Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond.
We still love you. Sisters forever!
Hello! You're like, a lawyer.
No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers.
Don't ask.
So?
The what?
Oh, my God!
No -- it's just -- not me.
Oh, he is so over on this campus.
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
I did?
Wait -- my social events schedule is missing.
Of course.
I completely agree.
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.
C'mon. Let me take you home.
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself.
Hovering?
Elle?
Is it a Kappa?
Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I'm serious enough?
You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a hand-job after the final.
There he is!
Why so few?
Fight's over before it's begun... soon the survivors will be in full retreat.
We come watch... we come watch...
Your love.
I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.
Why have you brought me here?
Yes?
It sounded like it came from the courtyard.
And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures...
Now I want to live forever.  I've never felt so strong or happy.
You come stealee tleasoo?
Flozen foleva not good.
An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
Baron Couer de Noir is a blight 'gainst all nature.  We dwarves be not fighters; still we are with you in this battle.  Some of our handiwork may be of assistance.
No!  Tis not the time!  I want no part of your frolic.
No... I... I need to rest.
Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?
If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
So I'm to be a dragon-slayer, is that it?
How do we follow a raven we can't even see?
Aye.  He's enchanted the lot of them.  His reward for delivering the unicorn.
Worse than the battlefield.
Is she... dead?
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
Don't like the feel of it, Jack.
Give in to despair and all is lost.
Tells you something 'bout him what lives there...
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
The Baron hides in the dark in a passage under the Castle... Quick, give me the dwarf's key... the one which opens any lock...
Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.
I'm not afraid of the dark.
Will you explain what's going on?
Nay.  It was lost.  When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.
You see!  You see!
Look at that shot!  Three at once! I can't miss!
How're these?
Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored.
But you did... you did!
Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn?
I detest serpents.
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.
Jack!
I'm afraid it may storm.
What have I done?
What?
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
Sigurd's sword...
Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
How do I get the horn back?
This is sad news, be it true.
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!
I'm in your debt, Screwball.
Hello, Jack.
Forgive my blood haste, Jimmy Squarefoot, but I want no more surprises from Couer de Noir.
Simple as that, eh?
Can you show us the way?
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
Are you going to see Sam again?
Did you know him before you knew Dad?
He's not there.
Oh.
Red.
I put him to work.
What are you doing up so early?
He must.
Are you his friend?
Alyssa.
Don't you have school?
Can you keep Sam straight?
You have to ask like that?
I'm hungry!  Where's my dinner?  Who ate my dinner?  Huh?  Who's in trouble now?
Do you remember me from when you lived here?
I'm coming in.
Josh said...
You hate your father.
Where are you?!
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
I'm good, thanks.
Well, I feel better about this now.
Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
Sam?
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
George, this is the third time.
You'll have to explain that to the police.
Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
You'll have money when you work.
When are you going to be back?
Well, until you know, you can't go.
That's not true.
Sun glasses?
We're all dying from the start.  I just got picked for Advanced Placement.
Can you build a house in four months?
I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.
Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?
I just wanted to know where Mom was?
Lock the door behind you.
When's school over?
One of you would end up dead.
Last time you were gone for a week!
We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.
It's not breakfast yet.
I thought you'd be up with the sun.
Where's Sam?
Tell him how you made me fall in love with you.
I thought we were helping.
I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.
What's your deal with Alyssa?
He already knows everything about what he can't do.  You can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.
He said he heard hammering.
What are you talking about?
If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry.
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
Despite you.
Do it now!
You got a dog?
I've missed you guys.
I guess I could teach you some things.
You could keep it and rent it out?
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?
I brought a few of my own.
They ain't men, Mae Rose. They're convicts. And nigger convicts to boot. Can you say nigger?
She's doing just fine.
He's a big one.
We get the games on the radio sometimes.
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
Sharp.
She always said that if you were on the outside...
Goodnight, Mr. Wilkins. Mr. Pike.
Cool it, Ray. You're gonna get us in a lot of trouble.
For the kind of money they charge here, you'd think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes.
I've never seen you in here before.
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink?  Two bourbons.
What I want to know is what happened to your cush between the time that you got up from the table and when I caught up with you in the Johnny?
Good, I'm looking forward to meeting this Spanky. Give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess.
Like this?
My daddy gave me this watch.
Ah, go chase yourself. I'll take my business elsewhere. And for future reference, you are no longer welcome at Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
When there is, you can forget about it. And I swear to God, you ever talk about my daddy again I'm gonna kick your bank-telling, loan-denying ass, you got me?
You mean this sign? The one that says "No Coloreds Allowed." That's a good question. Ray, how come we missed the sign?
Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude.
I said you're soft.
Alright. You want some pie?
Reward?
Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
Man, this is gonna delay everything. Spanky's gonna be pissed.
So?
Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.
What'd you say?
You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
Come on, Ray, time to go!
That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.
One of the new kids said they're farming those acres just north of the swamp. He said he saw a crop duster flying around the place.
Well, if that's the way it is...
You sure it was him?
Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with this.  Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. See, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. And it's not that I like you or anything, but I've kinda gotten used to having you around.
What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
It's too late for plans.
Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg.
Hey, the dude's holdin'.
Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.
So Ray and Claude got their pardons, right?
That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.
Man, you really bummed me out. That's a terrible story.  Nigger, you crying?
I'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head.
Appreciate it.
Couple years back, Cookie made it clear to Greenville.
Hey, Ray, you ever been to the Cotton Club?
What's your name?
Alright Willie, I think I got everything. I'll talk to Dillard, see if I can get up to the infirmary and check up on you. Make sure they're changing your diapers regular.
If you fuck me on this one, I'll spare no expense.
I'll take the little choirboy, if you don't mind.
Of course I can. Drink or she dies.  Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going.
Hello, Cassius.
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...
I'll call her later.
Wow. What... what did she look like?
Where did you meet my father?
They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
So far, so good. Now what?
From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
I mean... tough break.
You're a good devil, Dad.
Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
Boogerland!
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
Good idea... kill me.
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
It's freezing my hands.
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
Hey.
No.
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
Yes...
We're going to Jersey?
I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.
Don't do it.
Do me.
Yes. What is rent?
It looks like the work of a brother...
I'm a Sandman!
We're hungry do you have anything to eat?
How do you think we got here??!!
Where do you think we came from?
What other food?
But you don't know, you just say what everyone says. "One for one. One for one."
Did you ever see Francis-8?
Who invited you?
I just might look in on New You 483 myself.
Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
Killed? Why do you use that word?
You felt sad. What's your name?
And now?
About what?
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
Why show me?
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
I'd rather be with you.
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
Are you taking me to them?
What do you suppose this was...?
What's that?
What does it mean?
What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
Things change!
Of course... that's settled then. But just you remember your promise...
Hello, Sandman.
How long have you been living here?
How did you get here?
That's better than gold when it's cold.
My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
This rod is a fuckin', embarrassment, Carl. Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"?
What's happenin'?
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
What a fuckin' job.
I was here yesterday.
How would you like to take me to dinner?
Where's your phone? I have to call another taxi.
Can I call you?
Hi.
Set.
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
You all right?
I don't. I don't know him.
Goin' out with these clowns for a while.
The police called us.
Please tell me.
A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.
Where's Pete?
You talk to him?
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
Who is it?
I won't ever tailgate.
What's your axe?
Where's Alice?
When you didn't come to the club.
So?
Where would you feel safe?
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today?
How ya doin', Pete?
Hello.
Okay.
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
What are you guys doin'?
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
Where'd you come from?
Sheila...
Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!
Not even a radio?
Two years!?
Uh-huh.
Don't call me brother.
Good morning, Lovey.
I see.
Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
Is it?
Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.
Yes. And who is he ? How'd he get there?
They were in a quandary, and
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
Think of it! In times like these.
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
For a man who talks a great deal, it's amazing how unenlightening you can be.
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
Who?
He amputated his own leg?
Well, they didn't actually mean that.
Very often.
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
Yes. I'm afraid it does.
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
Please let me help you.
What exactly do you mean by "almost any time now"?
You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
"Ungrateful fool . . . !"  Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."
As far away as I ever want to be.
You're lying, aren't you?
Sit here, near me. I am an old man and can do no one any harm.
We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
Just what I needed too.
Hurray!
Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet?
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
I don't know.
Uh-huh.
George - you're behaving like a child. You haven't opened your mouth in two weeks.
What's she got to do with it?
You can't take her away from here!
So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
She was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were, Bob.
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.
There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.
Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
I'm thirty.
Ouch!
Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
Would you like to wring my little neck?
It would serve you right if you were left behind.
That's what I mean - mysterious. Mr. Conway, I don't like that man. He's too vague.
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
It's easy.  You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after.
They don't?
Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
This is a neurelyser. it was a gift from some friends from out of town. I need you to look at it.  This red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain.  More specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block.   I said I need you to look right here.
I think you're too used to it.  If you ask me, you've been doing this job too long.
Now what?
Jesus...
Since how long?
Would you call this a code 100?
Sure.
So... how'd you hear about this?
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
I don't think so.   I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  But you...  Exterminator, I'd understand.  But entopolgist?  No way.
What the hell does that mean?
What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is?
Nowhere.
We're from Scientific American.  We read about your discovery.  We'd like to take a look.
I mean, I dunno.  I've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability.  But never like this.
We need to talk to you about the alien.
Hard to tell.  I hope not.
Why, you might ask?  Because you're ready.  Because you've finally gone as far as you can go without it.
The other two will die without me.
Just some guy... they found.
Think, John.  Why would they set you up?
You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
That's not much.
You don't remember me, do you?
I put you away --
You set your patients on fire!
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him.  If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I.
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
Uh, sir...
Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.
I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
Really?  You've never been inside?
If it's a question of authority.
At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
They're not in any pain.  We keep their heads pretty well stocked with dopamine and endorphins. Plus, we maintain careful control over their serotonin levels -- don't want 'em to drift off to sleep, but they can't be kept too awake either.
I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
Are these all of her previsions?
Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus, what's up with your eye?
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
What happened?  Where's the rest?
Okay... now let me time you.
Sean -- you're not real.
I forgive you...
Do you know who I am?
You're not gonna kill me?
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
Let go of the gun.
Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.
You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
What's so funny?
You don't seem all that proud.
You're talking about the precogs...
So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
What?
Does Burgess know about this? About the Minority Report?
What safe place is that?
Where?
I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...
How do I even know which one has it?
It's insanity around here.
I understand.
He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
Precog Deja Vu...
Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
Anderton's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can't ID him to pick his pocket.  There's fewer consumers down there, which means fewer scanners to target him.
There are two others in the room besides Anderton and Crow.
What kind of cop were you before this?
People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.
He looks familiar.
We could have lunch together.
I don't have any sugar either.
That was our apartment.
Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part... Okay...
What the fuck was that about?
You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
What's wrong, baby?
I don't know.
I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone.
Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
Max offered to stake me.
But what about them?
He making the drop?
Where is this happening?
Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?
Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it?
I didn't say that.
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
'Dis?' 'Dis?' You're not in a position to 'dis', or 'give props', or whatever your Real World sense of fucking decorum tells you to do. You're nothing. You're wallpaper. You're not here to make fucking friends. Asking a motherfucker where he lives. And who the fuck told you 'Red Dragon'?.
A bad heart.
Now listen. The gig couldn't be simpler. You carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand off the bag, you're tight.
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
Taken care of?
Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...
Sorry, man, but...
Any time, bro.
I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
I think we might.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime. What are you? Nuts? You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
I gotta pick up the baby.
I don't know.
Ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. We gotta make it last.
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
Who's gonna smell me a mile away?
Shit. It's thirty-five cents. You got a dime?
You sold it? I thought they stole it.
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
You know this guy?
Yeah. What vibe?
Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
Look who's back? Want some champagne?
We're not getting whacked.
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
Eighty five.
It's gonna be fine.
Hey, boys.
Fine, fine. And you were...?
Kinda. Yeah.
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
You look good, man.
Yes?
Yes.
I operate out of the Chicago O'Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else?
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.
Stop.
The Welsh dude, sees all these niggers in perms and diamonds and shit, he gets nervous. But you motherfuckers, he just laughs. All beat up in your babaloo suit like Fruitpie the Magician.
Ricky.
So whenever we want...
I call 'em wiggers.
Sure. You boys want anything?
What about my keys?
You want... Why are you picking on me?
I never intended to test you two to that extent, but you both came through. I should've been informed there was a flag on the play, but I'll take that up with Ruiz. I made a few calls back East. Those punks weren't tied in with anyone. As for the Welshman, he wasn't in on it. He was just plain dumb. As for you, Ricky, your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van.
No...
So, we're talking money laundering...
I'm working trains. Selling.
Where can I get a hold of you?
It hit?
You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light.
What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
Come on, daddy, pull my coat. What happens if you give all that up? You get sick or somethin'? I pulled a hustle once and got out of the draft.
What? Everybody knows God is White.
What for?
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
Where am I gonna start?
Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant- eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens.
Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm --
I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
I will do it.
I don't know how.
What can I do for you?
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
Just an idle question.
I think so. Can you catch a plane?
I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore.
There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
Get some sleep.
I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
I called Sister Betty, she didn't tell you?
They were Hebrew, weren't they?
Stop me if I'm wrong. I "polarize the community." I "erroneously appraise the racial picture."
You know that gal?
Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.
Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
Another one?
Sheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty.
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
Well, all right, then.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
Bang, bang. You're dead.
I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby?
Palmed it right in the goddam chamber.
Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.
Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. He gets his jollies off.
Who the hell are they?
This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
What am I doing here?
Deal.
[Who killed her? You?]
[Do you know who I am?]
Who's he?
[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]
[The most important thing in life is family. And there you are. You have my family. What do you want?]
[This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --]
[The girl's. Pinta's.]
[Yes. Many times.]
Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. What's the catch?
How does it affect you?
When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?
I'm here.
You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good.
Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.
You got three of the fuckers. All dead.
Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?
Someone gave him more money than we could.
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
You're fast.
What are you doing?
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
Did you used to?
Where's my mother?
Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
Sorry.
Jordan!
Creasy... Wait.
Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
All my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance.
You need a bodyguard of some description. It's a dangerous world we live in. But you will get what you pay for. He doesn't need to be Superman, does he? Can you go fifteen grand?
And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.
She likes him.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
He has to go, Samuel.
Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
I told you she wasn't especially attractive, but that she had a good deal of charm, and she's really a real nice girl...
I told you she wasn't attractive...
Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?
That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.
We took them home alla way out in Brooklyn. Her name was Mary Feeney. What do you say? You think I oughta give her a ring? I'll take the skinny one.
My old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married?
It's early.
Are you kidding?
Marty, your mother wants you onna phone.
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
Ufa!
Ah?
When was this?
What they say?
Catherine, you are very dear to me. We have cried many times together. When my husband died, I would have gone insane if it were not for you. I ask you to come to my house, because I can make you happy. Please come to my house.
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.
I think you're kidding yourself, Clara. I used to think about moving out, you know? And that's what I used to say. "My mother needs me." But when you really get down to it, that ain't it at all. Actually, you need your father. You know what I mean? You're living at home, and you got your father and mother there, and you can go on like that -- being a little girl all your life.
No, Marty, please...
No...
No...
So I'll call you tomorrow.
Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.
It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. Pilletti. I hope I'll see you again.
Herbie! Wadda you doing here?!
...so the whole book winds up, Mike Hammer, he's inna room there with this doll. So he says, "You rat, you are the murderer." So she begins to con him, you know? She tells him how she loves him. And then Bam! He shoots her in the stomach. So she's laying there, gasping for breath, and she says, "How could you do that?" And he says, "It was easy."
All right, I'll see you, Thomas, because he wants an answer by Monday.
Sure. This girl said...
Oh, we got plenny-a room here.
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
Ma, I'm gonna take her home now. It's getting late, and the buses only run about one an hour.
That was a nice girl last night, Marty.  She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl.  I said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty...
Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, "Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."
Ma, you want something to eat, some tuna fish?
Tommy!
We wanted to tell you how you were helping us with your fixes.
What do you want me to do?
You boys'll have to go to work early.
She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
I don't think I should have opened my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon.
This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
Wisconsin.
We've stuck it out for a whole week now... Pretty girl.
And you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. Right? Does that mean...?
I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
Don't try to get it far down. Kick it up high so we can get there and surround that son-ofa-bitch.
Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game.
I thought we were heading for trouble putting on all these trinkets.
Ravenous. What about you?
Godless buffoons, all of them.
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
Frank...
Is that liquor?
...And for our young men on the field of battle, that they may return home to their dear ones...
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
What for?
Lucky you didn't have your mouth open or it would have gone down your throat.
I'm not so sure the goddam thing's in his heart.
Look.
Don't worry, son. That's Captain McIntyre, and he's the best chest surgeon in the Far East and maybe in the whole U.S. Army. He'll fix you up fine. Your daddy saw to that.
Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
It's in pretty deep.
If we squeeze him through, I'm going to get him into Androscoggin College.
Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. If he's as good as I think he is, he can move into the big league later. But Androscoggin first.
I don't feel anything.
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
It was really nice of you to take me along.
You really say the cutest things.
They missed the boat.
The real Trapper John? The one who threw you the famous pass and went to greater glory on the Boston and Maine Railroad?
Glad to know you. Drop in at my clinic anytime you feel like playing a little poker, or even if a tooth is bothering you.
There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.
Morning Painless. How they goin'?
There ought to be a law against dentists reading. Matter of fact, I thought there was. Anyway, this is an obsession. He can't be persuaded out of it.
I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
About that chest-cutter...
Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason.
Yeah?
We don't have to see him. Call that halfassed Army hospital and tell them to be ready to put some lipiodol in this kid's esophagus and take X- rays.
You're a couple o' sticks shy in your column, Ann.
Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
Now, look, John. Here's the speech. It's in caps and double-spaced. You won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous, are you?
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
Did you write this?
How much money do you get?
Hello?
Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!
That's good.
Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
The Websters!
That's your father's diary, Ann.
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
The letter.
We'll get a handwriting expert to  What!
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doeand he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
I can read. I can read!
But, he's gonna jump off a building!
Well, maybe you're right.
Now listen, Annhe can't possibly get in without our seeing him. I'm watching the side door and the Colonel's out front, so stop worrying.
Ann! Say, why didn't yuh
Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Doe!
Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc. Gimme that again, will yuh? Who's gonna get him?
Well, anyway, II guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
How could he be a fake? 
Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
Aw, Long John . . . I tell youit's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither! 
I gotta figure some way out of this thing!
Yeah, she's a heelot just like the rest of them. It's lucky you got away from her.
Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!
Join the John Doe Club.
Listen, palthis fifth column stuff's pretty rotten, isn't it?[11]
Look, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here.
Yes! I was paid! But the
It's good to see you. Sit down.
Flowers.
Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?
I bet you he'd know how to say it all right. And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
No -- you can't do that.
Apartment 306.
You told Antonucci that shit came from me.
Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
Don't make do it, Mike.
I won't get away with it.
Who's controlling your mind?
Tell me what's wrong.
Tell my dad.
It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you.
The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
Hold on a second here.
Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.
Hi, Roper.
Anything on Korda so far?
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
Satisfied?
I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them?
So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco?
You don't like New York?
Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
I can't do that.
You know the ten commandments?
I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.
Ronnie... Yeah, so.
How long you been coming here?
See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty.
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
That's a chance I gotta take.
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?
I wanted to get this out of the way.
I've been craving that stuff all week.
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
Scottie?
This is Halden.
What do you want?
There are two million people in there with you.
God-Damn you!
You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
She said I have a son...
This is how you pick up women --
You don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?
But this is impossible.
Divinity?
Dream?!
With the energy from the net, we can program this world anyway we want.  Redwood forests.  Oceans. Mountains --
Until you're on the net where the corporation can't touch you, you can't open the system.  They'll eject it if you do.
Where the hell are you going?
Try harder.
The only way to eject it is from the inside.
Most nights you wake up crying. Never knowing why.
We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --
To see how long it would take for me to realize.
But you were with me.
Voice activate.
We've got him locked!
It's far too dangerous.  Zordon would never allow it.
Ay, yi, yi, yi.  The legend speaks of a Master Warrior who lives on the planet Phaedos... This is the only person who knows the secrets of the power.
Is this... food!
He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
SYSTEM MALFUNCTION!
1600 m.p.h.  and increasing!
In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove.
I am the wolf, cunning and swift!
All systems go!
That's the only way to the Monolith...
The earth was hurtling toward us at seven hundred miles per hour, and we knew at that moment that we were facing death straight in the eye.
Here you go!  No pushing!
Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.
There goes the neighborhood.
Hey, boss!
What!
"Basically".
Did these sticks make a whistling sound?
Six become one... the combined forces of the Ninjetti.
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
I'm Bobby Clowes. Kansas City.
The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.
Life knocked me back.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
Shane was a friend of yours?
Bastard didn't even show.
Masseria's tryin' ta find a way around ya. But his patience won't hold out much longer.
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
I think Maranzano's talkin' a hell of a deal.
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
Inside, they were talking of you.
What's the matter?
Luciano.
Something came up.
Have you thought about this?
If I look weak now, it's over.
Meyer just finished the books.
Bugsy, you and I don't need to be in business with Maranzano. We got more jobs than we can handle. That's not the problem.
At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply.
Meyer.
Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
I been thinkin'...
We need to put together a meet for the whole country. We all got the same problems. We could talk. Meet the guys we don't know. Lift a few with the guys we do.
How soon can we pull this off?
Your honeymoon, Meyer?
After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.
You're getting' 10 cc's
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.
You're a smart boy, Charlie, but there's somethin' you ain't learned yet. A man needs a family.
Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.
And what went on your little party in Atlantic City. I got ears.
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
If I wanted ta kill ya, I woulda done it long ago. It's not like you ain't given me reason.
You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
We gotta talk in private. I got a friend in Coney Island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us.
When ya got all that blood workin' in your belly, it ain't upstairs where it needs to be.
Not stupid. Fat.
One move pardner, and you're a dead man.
And how many soldiers do you have?
Tell me, my son. Why did you go with Giuseppe? He's not our kind.
We must be friends, Charlie.
Why didn't you tell me that Maranzano had made you an offer?
Bring order out of chaos. If you lead... they'll follow.
Where's the stiff?
Masseria's scared. He might make our deal.
So we're gonna knock 'em both off?
I'm a hard guy. I done more jobs than alla you combined. And I never said no. Not once. But dammit I don't understand why the hell we gotta kill our friends!
Know something Tommy? You're a mensch.
Best we got.
Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.
How do you get from <u>here</u> - to <u>there</u>?
"4/17: Subject, when unaware of observation, prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet. Successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils...with feet."
Chasing me - animals - horrible -
Yeah, I know - Picasso. <u>Guernica</u>, right? That's what everybody says - although personally, I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking?
<i></i> I beg your pardon?
I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare.
Vital signs have stabilized. That's good.
At the moment, yes.
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
Oh my God...you're proposing?
So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. We get a big piata. We fill it with Monkeybone dolls - <u>hundreds</u> of 'em.
Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?
Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a <u>putz</u> - and I should know. I'm his little brother.
Land of Death. How do I get there?
Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ?
Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.
What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising!
Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?
What's the matter?
I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could <u>both</u> be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't <u>count</u>.
He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here?
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you.
It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
Oh, let me get out of your way then.
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?
What about the fellow in those pictures?
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
I love you, Mom.  I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right?
Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
Really?
Where to?
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ...
You mean it's dangerous?
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
And you say you never signed this contract with Mr. Allen?
But it *isn't*?
Tell me why!
Huh?
What! Who?
Will you go chase an ambulance!
Why do I always laugh at that?
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
Diz--
How about getting married?
Okay. You don't mind?
What!
I knew it! I knew a night's rest wasn't possible in this house!  Hubert!
Yes, yes--tell them I'll see them immediately--immediately!  I can't hold them off! They want something to say about this appointment. Ten to one they've got a man.
One minute! Just one minute!
But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--
*But you never asked me*!
What were you saying, Governor? Sorry.
"Boy Stuff." That's the name of Jeff's magazine. He prints it.  Look--here's one--oh, it's great-- *everybody* reads it--all the kids in the State--a million of 'em. Look, Pop--let me read you a--
He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it.
Jeff for Senator.
A dirty frame!
Maybe you'd like to come along and watch, Governor? Jefferson's done a wonderful job with that leg.
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
Where were you?
Will the Senator yield for a question?
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
I mean, sir--if I'm going to stay in the Senate--I ought to know what I'm doing--at least, I ought to try to study the Bills that are coming up--
Yes, I was--
I'm sorry! Gee! I hope--
For a *question*.
I have no defense against forged papers and--
Yes, sir, you bet I would.
Please, sir!--come with me!
Good evening, sir. I was just making some--  Governor Hopper!
Gee--I'm sorry about that, Miss--you *are* Miss Saunders, aren't you?
I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--
Now, if you're ready, Senator, we can start for the hotel. I'll *see* that you get there.
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee--
Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar--
No! Go right ahead, Miss Saunders.
--that's the main idea, Miss Saunders. The United States Government isn't going to buy or build this camp-- just lend us the money. You've made a note of that, huh?
Uh--have you?  Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?
Well--gosh--that--that isn't "particulars," is it?
It hasn't been easy, has it?
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
Abigail.
Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
Fine--they're fine.  Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.
Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you again.  Well--it--it was nice seeing you, Miss Paine--
Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.
The Senator understands he is limited to five minutes?
"--We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights--"  Well--looks like the night shift's comin' on.
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
I wouldn't wait if I were you.
Here, Jeff, I'll advance it for you.-- Fine introduction to the nation's capital!
That won't work, Chick. This boy's honest, not stupid.
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
Well--me, too!
Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home.
Anything *better* to offer?
Jim--the boy's talking to that State-- the story is out--!
His first 'whiff'!
Mr. President...
Senator Paine will state it!
Is there objection?  You may proceed, Senator.
No. Don't ever want to go out without telling us.
Yeah, Mr. Cobb said stick to your tail no matter what.
That's going to be fun.
Good morning.
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
Since he was born.
He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
Were you given an assignment to follow the activities of Longfellow Deeds?
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
Are these the articles?
And you saw them happen?
Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him.
I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.
There's Times Square.
You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.
I've often thought about going back.
He played in the town band, too.
Mary, I'm going home.
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
Can I have a month's vacation?
Marvelous!  "At two o'clock this morning, Mr. Deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. When asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'I just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'"  Beautiful! What happened after that?
When're you going to see him again?
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
Who? Miss Dawson?
He's not home, I tell you!
Relatives of old man Semple.
Miss Bennett please!
It's a lie!
Mr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days.  Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers.
That's pretty.
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
It's merely a suggestion. I don't wish to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything. It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something.
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
Yes. That is to say
Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
I've got one for Cobb
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
That's impossible. The opera has never paid.
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
Let him alone.
Yes, sir.
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
No - I don't want it, thank you.
Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?
Uh-huh.
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet  thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
Who are they?
He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.
Hey, did you hear that?
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --  -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house?
Thank you.
...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.
I see.
I was... never satisfied.
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here.
I feel like we're making real progress here.
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.
We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc?
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so.  Nice car. How's that place?
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
They come through a few times each year.  Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again!  It's a tour.
Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
What it might take is... doing time.
-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like --  -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.
...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district --
What'd you want?
I think you do.
Wow. You're something.
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
I'm not making any promises.
We don't discuss it.
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
I can give myself a headache instantly.
There... I've given myself a real whopper.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
Transference!
Sofie...
The school board doesn't pay you? What kind of deal is that?
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
What are you doing? We're not done. I just need to find the thing...
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, "If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
Amazing.
What?
I want to tell you something, Doc, but before I do, I need to ask you a question... Because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, I haven't told anybody about this. It's the biggest secret I've got.
All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can.  And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us?  Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
Damn! What is your name?
-- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service?
Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.
But look at me now...
Sorry...
I'm here for you, Doc.
I told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all. For you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years.
You never were any good with the ladies, O'Connell.
Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?
Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy?
Yeah?
I'm sorry, it was an accident.
Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.
In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me.
The key!? She has the lost key!?
You bastards!
The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here.
And what did he say?
No women allowed.
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
You know your history.
For what?
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.
You...! YOU...!
Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?
Do you really think he'll show up?
It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this
She's my sister, actually.
That thing gives me the creeps.
You did not!?... We're not!?
We gotta get her back.
Where are you going?
We could really use some coffee --
But that place is huge and we don't know where this psycho thing is --
Casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it.
Mon Captain, it's for you. 
Hey... you okay?
Yes!
Superheroes.
Hi.
Then why are you here?
What?
Hi.
I admire you.
I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
It's me.
Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?
You're the Sphinx.
But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!
Maybe. But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny...
We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever. 
Cover me!
Maybe she's right.
Roy --
So you're only invisible... to yourself?
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
Or Batman --
And there's the Sphinx.
It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered.  Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet.  And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you?  You have had to rule with an iron hand.  You have turned friends into enemies.  And even at that, the result has only been partly effective.  You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials.  But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance.  You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies.
Your Majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as Ambassador.  But I would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the Emperor, if I did not say that it is entirely possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a French alliance for an English one -- with all the dangers that might entail.
I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle.
You have my absolute assurance, Your Majesty, that Napoleon does not have the strength to attack St. Petersburg now -- his army is exhausted and ill-supplied, and he would be defeated if he attempted that.
If he withdraws his army in good order, it will be a serious political defeat.  But, if he should be caught on the move, with his army, in the full grip of winter, then it will be a catastrophe.  If Your Majesty can prolong his hopes for a treaty by silence, be deceit, by any means, for another month, thus postponing his departure, then the graves of his army are already dug in the soil of Russia.
And, what a great pleasure it is, indeed, to meet you, Alexander.
Without a doubt, to estimate the enemy's strength on the battlefield. This is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct. At Jena, there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present.  Murat said there were 50,000, preparing to attack.  Berthier said there were no more than 25,000, about to withdraw. "Berthier sees only what is in the open," Murat said.  "But don't forget there is a second force hidden in the forest."  And so it would always go, each of them would judge things according to his own ability, character and state of mind, at the moment.
We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.
There are none here.
Well, Belliard, what's this?  What are you doing here?  Where is the enemy?
Ah, my poor Josephine.  She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world.  She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead.
You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
I haven't been there for three years.
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
Hello there, Picart.
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
I beg your indulgence, Ambassador, but it is.
The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
Oh...?
Thank you.
Thank you, Napoleon.
No -- not as a rule.
Then what brings you out on such a night?
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
Only Lisette?
Ah, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, you have no idea what happiness it brings me to see this child, at last.  I was told the very idea of such a visit would too much distress the Empress.
Ah, that is good.
Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
May I offer you a drink?
I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais.  I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon.
And you, are you in love with any one else?
Were they pretty?
Were any of them married?
Go away -- I'm busy.
How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
No, one cannot simply ignore it.
Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?
Do you know what you're saying?
How do you know?
I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.
You mean you heard them making love?
I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.
Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?
Do you like music?
Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
Article 46, calls for the virtual dismemberment of Prussia, reducing her population by half and her army to a token force.
England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform.
I suggest that you leave with your men while you can.
Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on August 15th, 1769.  He had not been a healthy baby and his mother, Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion.  In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena.
Well, let me in.
I know you smoke weed, right?
Stretch it out.
What's the green stuff poking out?
It's about to work, just come on.
This you?
I can't see!  I can't see!  Daddy!
You straight?
I walked.
What's the matter?
You better stop running from that girl.
Craig, what the hell are you doing?
What you see?
Karla.
Most definitely.
Delivery!
You coming in?
You too.
I can't give you your damn money back on this.
What it say?
What was that?
You wanna knock?
What the fuck you looking at?
Tape his mouth shut.
What you say?
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
Hey, what's going on?
Make sure you look after my son out here. Don't get him involved with none of your bullshit, Roy.
Need to lose some weight.
Well, we better hit the road, too. Craig, get your stuff.
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
Where'd you come from?
Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you.
How do you know that?
Who did?
This? I've never even fired one.
Good luck.
Come with us, sir.
You're out of your mind.
This says "invitation only".
This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
Are you 'fucking with me!?
I killed you.
Come back.
...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together.
Is that something precious?
Are you sure?
But...
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?
Ready?
No. Kisses to you.
What do you do, if I may be so bold?
You got anything smaller?
Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about.
Cover your mouth.
Who?
Oh, Jesus ...
It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  That's just what I thought I was supposed to do.
Irene is going to help.
Well?
You have, huh?
You talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead.  Do it.
Yeah.
He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke.
He never told about the money.
No, Ben.
That Sword has served me through many an evil time, Ben Harper.
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
Here they come.
You understand?
..."and I won't never tell about the money."
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
Yes! Yes!
See ye got two more peeps to your brood.
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
What's wrong, Mother?
Dear Walt and Icey: I bet you been worried and gave us up for lost. Took the kids down here with me for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm. Thot a little change of scenery would do us all a world of good after so much trubble and heartache. At least the kids will git a plenty of good home cooking. Your devoted Harry Powell
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
Twenty-five wives!
Draggin' the name of the Lord through the evil mud of his soul!
He lied!
Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!
Pearl dotes on him.
That boy's as stubborn and mulish as a sheep!
I tried to save her.
Stand still, Miss Jenny!
Hing, hang, hung.
Why?
Where's Mom?
John?
John, when your Dad says 'come', you should mind him.
Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was.
What's taking you so long about it?
What's that you're playing with, boy?
She thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?
Now: Where?
Sure, that's no secret.
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
John, Mr. Powell has got something to tell you.
Get up, Willa.
Do you want more children, Willa?
You were listening outside the parlor window.
Answer me!
Mornin', ladies.
She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
What are you after them for?
You'll whip me!
What'd you all talk about?
Miz Cooper!
Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. Don't worry, they go away.
Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.
How can you tell?
So we'll guard her together. Through the night.  In each others' arms like we always said.
Meanwhile...?
Rod's not a lunatic.
Lieutenant Thompson. Sorry to wake you, but --
Get into bed.
It's real, Mamma. Feel it.
Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger.
The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.
Thank you, Comrade.
Bring me forty-five back.
What is it, Ninotchka?
I'll tell you later.  That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?
No, that's not him...
We are not comrades any more... we are friends, Ninotchka.
Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.
Misha! Misha!
Yes! We could stay with Leon!
We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look...  The service in this hotel is terrible!  See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.
How are things in Moscow?
Let's not close our eyes. There are many good things to see here too.
The former Duchess!
Good morning, Your Highness.
Good evening, Gaston.
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
What time have you, Gaston?
I guess it is eight forty-two.
And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something.
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
General, would you mind making my excuses at our table? I'll be back in a few moments.
Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.
Is this satisfactory?
Comrades, why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful.
They tell me when you ring once the valet comes in; when you ring twice you get the waiter; and do you know what happens when you ring three times? A maid comes in -- a French maid.
That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!
Leon, my little boy.
We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade?
She says she won't be intimidated by parasites. She called the Duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer.
Yes, monsieur?
Now, monsieur, you have no right...
Allow me, Comrade.
We dealt directly with the representative of the Grand Duchess. I am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.
If there is anything we can do for you...
The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good.
She must have her little joke.  You're not going to take that seriously.
Yes!
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
In other words you don't know.
Thank you.
Four massive piers of masonry are sunk to a depth of forty-six feet on the side of the Seine, and twenty- nine and one-half feet on the other side. The girders of interlaced iron- work which stay the structure have an inclination of fifty-four degrees...
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
And what do you do for mankind?
That is correct.
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
You repeat yourself.
It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?
I must go.
Let's forget that we ever met.
Then do it through my lawyer!
But, Ninotchka, I held you in my arms. You kissed me!
Room service speaking.
Ha! Ha! Now go back.
Not funny, huh?
Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?
She is very attractive. She has great elegance.  She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?
I wouldn't know. The closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
No speech.
Radio! What is radio?
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
Is this the wish of the masses?
Oh, Leon!
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
Will you do me a favor? Stop talking about the good old days.
Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll...
Brutal frankness, if you insist.
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
Now, please, Swana.
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
You leave me no choice.
Unfortunately.
May I have your bags, madame?
That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?
Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
For Christ's sake, it soils my mother's memory.  Do you think I want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this?  Raising a dirty mouth!
The bigger problem I see is this guy who was arrested, McCord -- James McCord -- he headed up security for the Committee to Re-Elect.  He turns out to be ex-CIA.
I was sorry to hear about your wife.
Is it?
How the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the President of the United States?
It was her wrist.  And it was through a plate-glass door.
Eight words back in '72 -- "I covered up.  I was wrong.  I'm sorry" -- and the American public would've forgiven him.  But we never opened our mouths, John.  We failed him.
Hunt?  Howard Hunt?
Goddamn! How long have we had this fucking dog?!  Two years, he still doesn't come!  We need a dog that looks happy when the press is around.
He's begging for a meeting, chief.  He wants to go overseas for awhile.
I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit!  You know who's behind this, don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president.
It'll never wash.  Pardoning them means we're guilty.  The people, the press will go nuts.
This is June twentieth?
Exactly!  We've got to take the war to them.  Hit 'em where it hurts -- right in the nuts.  More assassinations, more killings.  Right, Al?
"Victory at Sea," Al ... Henry.  The Pacific Theatre.  Christ, you can almost feel the waves breaking over the decks.
June twenty-third, '72, sir.  The part that's underlined.  Your instructions to Haldeman regarding the CIA and the FBI.
Sir, the deadline is today.
... they smelled the blood on me this time, Al.  I got soft.  You know ... that rusty, metallic smell ...
Their fourth!
He works for Colson.  He used him on the Pentagon Papers.  We're trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a White House consultant.  After the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his White House safe.
But what are we paying him for?
But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate.  We're clean.  It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's "national security."
"National security priority restricted and controlled secret."
Bob, did I approve the Ellsberg thing? You know, I'm glad we tape all these conversations because ... I never approved that break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist.  Or maybe I approved it after the fact?  Someday we've got to start transcribing the tapes.
This isn't a "moral" issue, Bob.  We have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes.  The FBI is filled with people who are pissed that I put Gray in and not one of their own.  Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union: when you look at the big picture, Bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world.  Let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary.
I don't understand.  Track 2's Chile?
The first assassination attempt was in '60, just before the election.
He didn't veto it.  I ran the White House side.  The mob contact was Johnny Roselli.  One of the CIA guys was that jackass, Howard Hunt.
... he'd just found out about Track 2.
Well, one way or the other, Kent State is not good.  We have to get out in front of this thing.  The PR is going to murder us.
Mr. President!
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
You know, they all miss the point. Probably our biggest achievement as an administration, when it's all said and done, isn't China or Russia.  It's pulling out of Vietnam without a right wing revolt.
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
Because they're not Americans.
You know why they're turning on me? They're not serious about power, that's why.  They're playing with power.  They're forgetting the national interest.  In the old days, people knew how to hold power, how to set limits.  They wouldn't have torn this country apart over a third-rate burglary. All they care about now are their egos, looking good at cocktail parties ...
Please!  I'll never let you down again, Mother.  Never.  I promise.
It's meant to make us stronger.  Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen thee to survive ...
Is there something else that's bothering you, Mr. President?
We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos.
Roselli?  Johnny Roselli?
You'll win the nomination.
Kissinger?
Let's get the fuck out of here, shall we, ladies?
Like you said Jack, I'm just a New York lawyer now.
I know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a Republican, and she'd do anything for the Party.
Gentlemen, I tried.  I told Kennedy to go into Cuba.  He heard me and he made his decision.  I appreciate your sentiments.  I've heard them from many fine Cuban patriots, but it's nothing I can do anything about.  Now, it's a long drive back to Dallas tonight, and Trini and I have got an early flight tomorrow to New York ...
And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ...
Because if you're uncomfortable with the EPA up your ass, try the IRS ...
Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli.  They all went through the pain of losing power.
You have many friends ... and admirers ...
It was illegal, what he did.
Hiss was protecting his wife.  I've always believed that.
Sorry, Dick.  She's a little tipsy.
Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
Uh, wait ...
Jesus Christ!
You all right?
... Somebody should shoot the little bastard.
... Use his women.
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
What you have to understand, Mr. Nixon, is that we are willing to die for what we believe in.
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
We gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are -- that Nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything!  I played a lot of poker in World War II , and I won big, and let me tell you this -- unpredictability is our best asset.  That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and I'm bluffing.  I've got to play the hawk in Vietnam and the dove in China. And if we keep our heads, we can win this thing.
Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute.
Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in here?
Yes!  This is about me.  Why can't you understand that, you of all people? It's not the war -- it's Nixon!  They want to destroy Nixon!  And if I expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out.  Do you want that?  Do you want to see that, Buddy?  It's not pretty.
No, I don't.  I'm not Jack ...
Yes.
I'm the only left, Dick.  If you don't talk to me, you ...
Howya doin'!  New York treating you okay?  I'm sorry I haven't been able to see you at all--
But being out of the game gives me time to write.
Write.  You know, a book.  I'm calling it "Six Crises."  It's a good thing, Rocky -- take some time off to write.
Let's wait and see how you survive your first crisis, Rocky ...
Some say you are, Rocky.
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
No money in his room there?
I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.
None of that explains your man though.
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
Who's Charlie Walser. Oh! Well, I, uh... True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail but... it's certainly true that it is a story.
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
...How come do you reckon the coyotes ain't been at 'em?
These boys is all swole up. So this was earlier: gettin set to trade. Then, whoa, differences... You know: might not of even been no money.
We goin' in?
...Now that's aggravating.
Sheriff, that's aggravating.
You think this boy Moss has got any notion of the sorts of sons of bitches that are huntin' him?
What was the bullet?
I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there?
Yessir. None of the three had ID on 'em but they're tellin' me all three is Mexicans. Was Mexicans.
Yessir.
Yessir. It was punched out.
Yessir.
I thought it was a car afire.
What's in the satchel?
Did you buy that gun?
...If I don't come back tell Mother I love her.
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
Llewelyn --
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.
Llewelyn?
Llewelyn?
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you in the lurch.
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
And where is that.
Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?
Hello?
What's this about?
How'd you find it?
What airport would you use.
...You need to talk to me.
...Me?
How much?
This. And the gas.
What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?
Will there be anything else?
Yessir.
Well... I need to close now --
...What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?
Just call it.
Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.
What kind of tent?
Yessir, that's correct. I know 'em when I see 'em.
Okay.
Well enough.
What do you want to know?
He killed three men in a motel in Del Rio yesterday. And two others at that colossal goatfuck out in the desert.
Could I get another room.
No, one forty-two.
...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
Cast iron?
...You didn't take the product, did you?
No no. No. You don't understand. You can't make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He's not like you. He's not even like me.
Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
That is correct. And how do I decide?
Are you in the service?
Nam?
What outfit.
How is she?
Jesus...
Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
One question, Doctor, please!  You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!!
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.
So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
No... what about your sister?
Aahhh...  So what color is it?
I gotta go.
Oh, you mean Fred.
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
Your lines are in the script, but you can ad lib.
I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?!
...well, then you ain't got much.
Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
What're you doing here, Roy?
Shut up, Merle... Williams.
I left my husband two days ago.
What are you doing?
It's something I had to do. For David.
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
Guess who I saw today.
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
Looking for someone?
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
What are you doing?
Your husband?!
What?! That you had something to do with it?
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
Like what?
Bourbon, little water, thank you.
I didn't. You gave me a look!
Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this.  This was supposed to be my last job. I already put the deposit down on my boat.  How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just watching you...
I hope you're right...
I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
What?
That woman could be in any one of four states. Four big states where the deer and the antelope play, Wesley! We're not in Rhode Island!
You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you? Nah. You're like me.
How'd they describe her?
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
"When I grow up I'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral..."  Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you?
Well, guess what? I found Betty... where she's been, anyway.
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
What doesn't?
I never said that I believed...
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
But she wanted more out of life, right?
Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
She makes me stretch! I got inside my character last night like I haven't done in six years on "Reason". It was a totally rejuvenating experience.
Can I have an evil twin?
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty...
You're wastin' your time, Roy.
What did you say?
Her show?
Huh?
Thankee boys for throwin' in that fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt I was feeling a mite peckish.
You can't do this -
It ain't the law!
'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.
That's right!
We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just thought you was a toad.
Huh?!
NOW HOLD ON, BOYS-AINTCHA EVER HEARD OF A NEGOTIATION? MAYBE WE CAN TALK THIS THING OUT!
...but try getting a decent hair jelly.
Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George?
What on earth is goin' on here! What's got into you, Delmar!
Uh, we uh-
Finest governor we've ever had in M'sippi.
I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
It's just a symbol, honey -
How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis.
Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.
A million dollars.
Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...
Well, it's a invitation-only affair; we'll have to sneak in through the service entrance-
...Yeah?
I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!
Mama said you was hit by a train!
She's at the five and dime.
You, Zack?
How was the flight? They take care of you okay? Long way from Norfolk, isn't it?
You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
Hi, Byron.
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!
Ay, palequero. Never hochi in the P.I.
So what're you doing in Seattle?
Who gave you this idea?
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
Good morning, girls.
Zack, we've got to go.
She may not make it through the program, but she's got more heart and more character than you'll ever have. I've seen your college record. I've never heard of most of those schools. Tell me something, Mayo. Did you buy that degree?
Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
See you in the fleet, sir!
Before that.
Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?
I know why most of you are here. We're not stupid. But before you get to sell what we teach you over at United Airlines, you gotta give the Navy six years of your life, Sweet Pea. Lot of things can happen in six year. Another war could come up in six years. If you're too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an enemy village where there might be women and children, I'm gonna find that out. Understand?
Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
Is your brother a flyer?
Forget that. Come on. Got a little surprise...
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
Sid, there's no baby.
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
What do you want, Paula? What do you really want?
Zack, I dare you not to fall in love with me. I ain't gonna get serious with you, no way. But how can you resist me? I'm like candy.
I don't care what the magazines say... it's just not as easy being a girl, especially from a Catholic family. You don't know the junk I grew up listening to, 'bout the way women are supposed to think and act.
My old lady swallowed a bottle of pills one day while I was at school.
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
I'm looking for Sid.
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
Two bucks a buckle, Perryman. Look at that shine! Boonies'll cost you five.
Jets.
You told us it would grow out an inch.
Nice, hospitable folks they get around here.  I hope she comes.
What? You've gotta be kidding!
Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor?
Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
He said open it.
You got an idea?
The hell does she want?
Fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks!  They shouldn't be here for another week!  They don't own this house yet!
I'm afraid to let you think, Junior. Things get worse when you think.  Oh, that's gonna help.
Be quiet.
She's never coming out.
You walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.
May I ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be?
Third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used it as an office.
Master bath.
That's highly inappropriate.
Push that button for me, will you?
That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my idea to get the plans, I found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at no point did I say "you" or Raoul," got it?
No cars.  Feet are faster.
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
What if they get in here?
We're not coming out.  We're not letting you in.  Get out of my house. 
Oh, please.
Are you freaking out?
Got him!
We're never getting out of here.
Call Dad!
I'm sorry.
Why?
Alma!? I uhh I don't think...
Well... is it loaded?
You got six months to donate to the party, Bobby?
What's up?
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
I ain't gonna tell you no more. No pushing in the neighborhood, especially not on my fucking street. You're killing your own people asshole.
Hey, this what they got you doing now?
Hey, it's the invisible man. Brother where you been?
Cy... Cy... Oh shit man... who did this to you. Was it the pigs?
Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous,
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
Yes sir I was.
Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting?
Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left...
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
This here's a "Panther Patrol." We see a brother getting busted. We check it out, make sure the pig don't go beating on the man. Brother gets taken downtown, we post bail, hook 'em up with a lawyer.
You're a little old to be a school boy aren't you brother.  Cool it! You're probably not the only one they've gone after. Stall a little so they believe you're for real. Make them trust you.  Hey Tyrone, you figure feeding our children is gonna make The Man jumpy?
Yeah man, but where's Judge?
We put our lives on the line today. Malcolm X's widow was on the line today. And your guns weren't even loaded.
You were. infantry right?
Judge... we're doing security for Betty Shabazz's visit next week. I'd like to have someone who knows there way around a pistol there. Someone like you.
Listen Judge, Oakland's Panther International Headquarters. We shut the Pig's infiltration down here, they're gonna think twice about running their games on other chapters.
I don't know man. I don't know. That reminds me.  Another little donation from the police.
Shit, we made him get his moms to give permission before he could sign up.
Busted firing pin.  You want only the legal stuff right?
What? You don't like to see a traitor get hurt? I wonder why that is?
Fuck is up?!
We'll all get out of here together.
You meet those friends of yours in jail too?
Do you think Francis with an "i" is too womanly a name for a boy?
You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
He shouldn't make light.  That Redcoat should not have been killed.
I know him well enough?
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
What unit?
My boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed.  Thank you for that, Colonel.
First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
Very well, let us move on to...
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
And if I triumph, you triumph.
I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.
Father...
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
These four wagons must be his.
Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured.
When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
She spoke?  Susan spoke?
She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.
We buried them, then we went to track.  It was a cold trail and they were moving fast.  We went faster. We caught up to them at Kentucky Ford.
... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery...
Who's in command?
His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child.
Goodbye, Francis.
For trying to impose some decency on that sort.
Gray.
Honey, Church will be fine.
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
Was it Pascow?
My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed.
Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days?
But--
We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!
Jud, why am I doing all this?
I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But...
They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on.
Leave me alone!
You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?
She's finally asleep.
Don't be silly. Church is not going to die.
I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard.
You better get going, hon.
How does he do that?
What's in your head, boy?
We got that part.  Anything else?
No!  You gave your word!
That's your offer?  You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a name?
I'll watch my back.
There was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates.  What is it you want?
I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.  Means 'No.'
You've got sand, for a maid.
Maid or not, it fits you.
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
Man overboard!
Did he speak?
Elizabeth, I'm relieved you're safe.  Clap him in irons.  And behind his back this time.
Difficult ... to say.
I know the code.
If I had known --
There.  And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!
It doesn't!
You are despicable.
You're in league with Barbossa!
Don't be thinking I'm happy about this, Elizabeth.  But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about.
When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!
Say again?
Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
What's your name?
But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
We're going to steal a ship?  That ship?
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
Jack!
You haven't seen it.
He's still breathing.
Dr. Argon, everything's starting to come apart here.  You hired me to take care of these matters of security and I am trying, but elements are making my job impossible.
Wheelchair accessible.
I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build.
What are you going to do to him?
What did you use?
Poison?  I'm surprised at you.  You lack vision, Mr. O'Brien.
The body is just another part of nature and ever since we gave up trees for central air, there has been nothing sacred about nature. Nature is the enemy, Mr. O'Brien, and science is our greatest weapon against her.
How apropos.
As you can see I am a new man, just like you.
It remains to be seen who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. History is written by the victor.
It works, Poppy.  It works, it works!
Do you think she loves him?
Icarus?
Poppy, please --
Well, at this time, I mean that is to say, it is difficult to project --
What is it with you litterbugs?  Is it a territorial thing, marking your turf with your garbage?
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
I don't believe this is happening...
There's a guard outside my door! I'm a prisoner, Nigel!  Do you understand that?
You want to tell me what I'm looking for?
What's it smell like?
The big house.
You don't know?
Oh no, no, no!  You've got to be able to fix me!  Please, Susan, tell me you can make me normal again!
Pills... you know how I feel about pills.
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
Just look at it!
You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
I feel very emotional right now.  A bit out of control.
Do you have something to bring me down?
I'm going to go out for a while.  I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
That's going to fit me?
You made this out of my hair?
I didn't know what was going to happen.  I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
Argon's private lab.
That means the nanobot is still inside him.
You're not going after Argon!
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.
Vermin...
If you don't have any questions, I'll let you get back to doing your job.
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building?
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
May I use your telephone?
Where did you get those letters?
I suppose you're going to print them?
won't even pretend it isn't a very great favor. I wish there was something I could do for you
Oh, Mother!
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house
We could have the whole left wing? Wouldn't that be nice! Would that be room enough for us?
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now
You wear them of course, silly.
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!
You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
Stewart! We're all waiting for you. Where's your valet?
I'm not going!
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home.
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
You've done nothing but watch me - watch me! - ever since I've been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that Jane  goes out and counts the silverware.
It's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family. I can't imagine what made you do such a thing. A reporter! Of all things, a reporter! A barbarian who lets his socks come down!
Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night.
Why doesn't Dexter show some decency? And you might show some too, Mother. What do you expect a man to do when he's called such names?  I'm glad you hit that reporter, Stewart. He deserved it.
Yale '21, I believe.
What do you want?
How's that?
Yeah.
Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?
Now listen, we've got a tip that the Schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame.
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
All right, outside!
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
He's probably very tired. You see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight.
You're sure going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer[4] from now on!
Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.
There you go, talking like a woman!
Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
Joe! A little snifter.  Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh?  Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
Oh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why -
No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.
I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.
Okay.
You know what I should do with you? I should sock you right in that funny little nose.
How far have you gotten?
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
What could I be?
Hey, Gallagher!
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
What other girl?
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
Traps shut!
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right, you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut.
Fine, but kinda thirsty.
Come in, Joe. It's all right.
What's going on here? Who is this woman?
Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh?  Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake!  Now, as a Smith to a Smythe
But I
Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?
Yes sir.
Yes.
Can I ask you a question?
What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
Have you got any make up?
Oh, hello Betty.
Oh, hi ...
I just thought ... It's beautiful.
Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
Look at me George. That meeting's not for me. Look at my face.
It goes away ... It'll go away.
I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue.
Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...
Oh God! Are we in that episode?
I don't believe it.
I'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town.  You know what I mean by "changes"?
BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?
You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!
You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's gonna like beeeee here!
Noooooo!
You know him?
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
No way.
I could like kill a guy with these things.
So what's the point?
You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED you.
No. She really liked you.
Besides. You think there's like a chance I'm gonna get into college back there?
You got the admissions letter.
And you're sure about this?
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
How?
What's going on?
Real rain?
You're gonna forget about me.
A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little disaster didn't ya fella.
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.
Don't get upset.
WAIT A MINUTE!!
So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again.
I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
Excuse me?
What do you mean?
Where's the remote control I gave you?
Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.
Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.
You know what I really like?
Oh, hi.
Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.
Hey.
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
Yes, I'll be there.
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
What's the listing?
Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?
I don't think I'm going to the party.
Hey....I was just telling everyone about how I was gonna bring this girl for you but you wouldn't let me do it.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
Are you gonna do it?
Yeah I can't.
Why's it here?
What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
No she didn't; that's a lie.
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
-- what are you talking about, come on --
Yes.
Hi. This is Jack.
Nothing.
No.
No, I mean, what city, what state are you in?
No.
Sure.
...just talking to you....
Well. I have no way of knowing. So it doesn't matter.
I'm horny, Jack, what about you?
Yeah....do you do well, do you make alotta money?
Hello?
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
No. No. We got disconnect -- why?.....you're calling me at work....how did you get this number -- ?
Why did you tell me you did, then?
Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?
I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
Business is good, you're busy?
Do you want to pick me up?
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
Who is it?
....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
....No....
I don't know.
Hi.
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
Do you wanna have sex?
I forgot about that.
Ok.
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
Yeah.
Your hand is bleeding.
Can I pay you here? Can I pay you for our drinks and salad?
Hi, is this your first time calling?
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
Of course, it's just for us to verify your credit card information. It's completely confidential and it appears on your credit card billing statement as D&D Mattress Man.
You want her to call you Jack?
You do guaranteed sale? etc.
How many sisters do you have?
How you doin' Barry?
Mhm.
Hey, good morning, Barry.
What is this?
No.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days.
Which guy in Toledo are you talking about?
You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?
No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --
HEY. You made a fucking sex call and now you're gonna pay. It's not a big thing -- just give us some money and then it's over -- we'll just walk down to the ATM and get your money out --
Ok. This is what you get when you're a pervert -- you said you'd help someone out and you didn't so we're just getting some money for her and that's that.
They need to be scanned individually. They each have a bar code, so I need it scanned individually so that each and every cup appears on the receipt...
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
Ok.
I'll see you there.
Put him through.
He's wearing a suit again, I don't know why he's wearing a suit, he doesn't usually dress like that --
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?
So...did my brother call you?
I'll just see you when you get back here.
If you're going to slander him, then you don't deserve to hear his stories --
Has he hurt you?
Had I known your taste in novels, I never would've taught you to read.
Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.
Don't turn us out, Abbe.
Go back to your room. Quickly.
I must grant him his last rites.
Care for a splash of wine, Abbe?
And --?
You've a touch of the poet, too; perhaps you should take up the quill.
You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.
My bed, gone! Am I to freeze to death?
That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime --
WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
What on earth would that require?
I saw the longing in your eye --
I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed?
Dr. Royer-Collard? May I be the first to welcome you to Charenton --
I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.
Indiscretions, Abbe? Please. I've read his case history. At sixteen, he violated a serving girl with a crucifix. After six months in the dungeon at Vincennes, he mutilated a prostitute, cutting her flesh with a razor, then cauterizing the wounds with wax --
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?
Well?
And --?
I have.
It was not inspired by circumstance.
You ought to be ashamed, Abbe. Exploiting those drooling, pathetic cretins for financial gain --
I'll do everything in my power --
You'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force.
Will you sleep soundly tonight?
Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
"The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..."
If only these coins purchased your other talents, too.
Most assuredly.
It's a long story, this one.
I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations.
-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!
You're aware, are you not, that it costs a great deal to house your husband at Charenton...
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
If you're truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity --
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
I'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon. There we can sit... side-by- side... before the fire.
Ever met Walter Winchell?
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
That poor woman.
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
Well, I wish you luck. It is a treacherous business.
It's not really--
We're 125 million dollars in debt?
That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight.
castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
It's all you. It has the political campaigns and the mining fortune and the war with Pulitzer and the castle. And ... Marion.
He lied to me
This is the chance you've been waiting for, boy. Tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him!
Hearst?
That's right, fella, no Hearst paper will run an RKO ad until you agree that CITIZEN KANE will never see the light of day.
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
But with compassion and insight--
How about Howard Hughes? We could do Hughes
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
Mank! You scoundrel! What took you so long?!
How long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle! Waiting for--!
Fuck you
Sorry to disappoint.
Let me out.
I don't have it anymore?!
It doesn't have to be
He'll destroy us.
So, who is he? We have to know him.
Hearst looks down at the world at his feet Everything has always been beneath him.
The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.
It's good, huh?
They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads--
They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints.
Not one of them today has what you had, Miss Davies. Not one of them.
To do what?
You're lying to me.
Yes
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud
Pardon?
For the title
What do you want me to do, Orson? Radio City won't premiere the picture. Louella threatened them with some bullshit about
Listen to me. The press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. And meantime I'm dealing with the stockholders in New York who are scared shitless -- and I'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. So you have got to trust that I'll do what I can to--
It was the best, kid
I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
Where you going at this hour?
That's what I'm sayin'. You shouldn't even think like that. It's crazy.
You know?
Sure. What is it?
Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again.
Who's that?
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
With her? How?
Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
Whatcha doin'?
I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
I'm gonna order up some stuff. Have a steak.
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like.
What do you mean, "you"?
Why not? There's nobody else around who wants to fight me; they're all afraid. I don't see why I shouldn't have a shot at the title right now.
He ain't hurting me, but I can't get him down.
You go first. Let me watch how to do this.
Now, touch me...  ...here.
I was just...
In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
What's the matter with you?
What'd you see?
Jake, no --
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
Why don't you just call him up?
I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.
Vickie, open up. I need to come in.
But they don't have a case against you.
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
All right, lemme ask you something. Let's say I was a good friend of yours. And I was telling you I was gonna bet a lot of money on you in this Janiro fight. What would you tell me?
Salvy, would I steer you wrong? Let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? Now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,  take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.
What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
What do you think, I'm blind? My brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
Indo-China -- Jeff predicted it would go sky-high.
Mrs. -- Thorwald's -- clothes. -- Clean -- carefully packed -- not too stylish -- but presentable.
You told me.  I've got to run, Jeff.
The building superintendent, and two tenants. Flat statements -- no hesitation. And they all jibed to the letter. The Thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station.
I hate to remind you -- but this all started because you said she was murdered. Now did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?
If possible -- both.
I can't do it even if he's gone.
Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
A detective's nightmare.
Forget the story -- find the trunk. Mrs. Thorwald's in it!
Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.
Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.
I know what you told me! She went in to get evidence, and she came out with it.
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
For what?
This is Wednesday.
Read some good books.
I'll send you some comic books.
Like what?
Jeff --
Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?
You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.
People have different emotional levels that --
Keep your mind off her.
He and his wife splitting up?
Isn't he a salesman?
A Federal offense.
Mrs. Thorwald?
There's a dip at this end. And since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?
I wonder.
When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this?
Ten here.
What about the rest?
Yes.
Something big going on somewhere?
You can't buy that kind of publicity.
Make the one you want.
Yes.
Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
What do you think?
I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
Maybe she died.
Lisa, please!
That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.
It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.
Something on your mind, Lisa?
A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
For a minute, Doyle almost had me convinced I was wrong.
Friend of yours?
Meaning me?
I thought only punks fought with knives.
Where can we meet?
What's he going to pull--
That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.
Tell him why we moved here.
The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
We don't have time.
Well, just get it off your chest, son.
Except yourself!
Son--this is all happening so fast--
I don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink.
No thanks, I don't smoke.
Frank?  I'm frightened.
Are you going down there?
What's your name!
I'm here.
I got to go in.  You better get home too.  Hey--what?
They're looking for you!--
Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and everybody!  I think they're going to kill you.
Hey where'd you go?
Nobody talks to children!  They just tell them one thing and mean another.
What?
Let's see how long we can stay under.
I don't want you for my father!
You crazy nut!  You crazy, crazy nut!
Plato?
I'm sorry.
'Bye, Mom.
What happened, darling.  We were so worried.  I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
No!  I don't want you to go to the police!  There were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
Well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving.
Do I have to spell it out?
Too bad you didn't connect.  You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
Things pretty tough for you at home?
If he could--
Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
Plato!
You don't have to be unfriendly.
See, I'm new.
I'm getting that way, too.
You can trust me, Judy.
Ever been in a place like this before?
What?
Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets--
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
You should have heard him talk about you tonight.  Like you were the hero in the China Seas.
Is he your friend?
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
Children?  Well, we really don't encourage them.  They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
Judy--we're ready for you now.
What?
Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
Didn't you forget something?
You're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo.  I thought you stopped doing that long ago.
Is this him!?
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
He wants... your "sister"...
-- till he fucked his parole --
Gabriel!
Gotta be ten degrees out there.
Negative five?
I don't think it's negative five.
No, c'mon --
I told you, Nick. Remember?
Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything --
I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.
He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters.
I'M NOT NICK!  You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me!
I thought we'd have a few more days.
Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...
I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...
We need to find a way to make me part of it.
He wants to see your map.
But I never said Rudy.
Who are you now.
You what...
So you could get with my sister.
She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
I had better sex in prison.
Let's get back on the road. It's time to start talking, Nick. Time to start telling tales --
How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.
We walked the place for a week.
They won't recognize me.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through?
Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?
Got something to say to me, Nick?
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access.
No, you're not.
Where the HELL did he go?
THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!
I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!
Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke?
I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?
Thanks, sister. How are ya.
What the hell was that about --
Monsters in the gelatin...
Hell you haven't.
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
Why you gotta say a thing like that.
Don't look like he missed the sunlight.
No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
Just a roach, Zook.
Tell Ashley... I...
Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
That was my card, pop! My card! You hit for my card!
POP! That was My card!
Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?
I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.
I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.
We can work this out, can't we?
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?
No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
What kinds questions did Cabot ask?
What?
But what is this?
I gotta memorize all this shit?
Mr. Brown?
I'm sorry.
How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?
But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he wouldn't be here. Okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody. But once again, at the risk of being redundant, if I even think I hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their Christian name...  ...you won't want to be you. Okay, quickly.  Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink.
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot. We like each other too much.
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.
Follow you where?
For what, the cops?
Because this guy's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard.
I told 'em not to touch the alarm. They touched it. I blew 'em full of holes. If they hadn't done what I told 'em not it, they'd still be alive.
Hey, just cancel that shit right now! You're hurt. You're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying.
Say-the-goddamn-words: You're gonna be okay!
I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?
How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
Look, enough of this "Mr White" shit -
No real people?
I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
Nope.
No shit?
Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.
I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
Why!
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
Don't fuckin' patronize me.
Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down!
Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
Hello Graham -- Joe -- Mr. Gardner.
You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
What's the matter with her?
Yes, ma'am.
What's the matter with her?
Where do you keep the can opener?
If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?
I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
Coffee?
You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?
But the rest is right.
Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.
What was he in jail for?
In a fight?
You must be plenty worried about Lednov sneakin' up on us.  Think he will?
Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.
All right, I hurt your feelings. But you know better than to go lightin' fires.
Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
Go on, hit me.
I said keep your nose out of my life. No kid is going to tell me how to run it.
How's that?
I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
I can't take her with me.
I can't take her with me.
Runnin' off and worryin' people. Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is already.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here where I belong.
You got no business snoopin' around --
I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
You think that's all we busted -- You should see...
It isn't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of.
Maybe I better start working on him.
How do you know who we are?
Clay Phillips.
What are you doin' --
Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
It wasn't Clay's fault. We've been moving around most all the time -- mebbe when we get the ranch and stay in one place I can learn my letters then --
Aren't we stayin'?
What comes after Z?
And that's tough, isn't it?
An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?
Well, Steve?
Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him.
She was only teasin'.
You don't know what it is to be sorry.
Goodnight.
Me, too. 101?
Thanks.
Cindy, what's going on?
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart...
Where the hell are we?
What about you, Buddy?
What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.
Stop it! I'm just trying to say I think we should take our friendship to the next level.
Okay, I get the point.
Let her go, Cin.
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
Where's Shorty?
Hanson, please.
Stop touching his brain!
This can't be happening?
What the hell are you doing?
He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
So, do you think you made it into the class?
Did you do that?
Hey, y'all! What's going on?
Yippie! Wasn't that amazing?
I'm telling you, it was possessed.
I take it you're not mad at me.
I think she's starting to suspect something?
I finished all the interviews.
Yes. The scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.
I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top.
That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
I have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. We want to be safe.
I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly.
I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
It's the best seat in the house. I warmed it up for you.
Alright... I might need your help.
It's okay. I understand.
Would you like to see the girl?
Oh shit, you gonna take that?
Yo' Tommy, what up, man?
Did you hear?
0h, shit!
I saw blood! And it's brown! Not red like in horror movies, but brown!!
Hi!
How about Mrs. Ackerman? We both hate her!  Should she be the next victim?
I'm Dr. Eugene Sutphin. What's the trouble, officer?
Sorry, ma'am.
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
Because it's the rules!
Oh God, really!  This is the limit!
Bye, Birdie.  Chip, honey... I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand... I'm your mother and I love you.
Get in, Mom! I have to open.
Are you Chip Sutphin?
He goes to college with me!
You've been working in that video shop too long.
Home Sweet Home! Everything's fine, kids!
No woman would!
I can't stop thinking about that poor teacher.  Goodnight, honey. Don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow.
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
Yeah! Oohhhh! Get it!
Beverly! Not the Sterners!
Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive obscene telephone calls?
You bitch!
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!
State your name, please.
Ooohhhhhh! I made it all up! I never saw Beverly Sutphin in my life!
0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!
Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!
That girl was looking for Jacqueline Gibson. I'd forget it if I were you.
We can't stand here all night.
No.
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
Well, then I can tell you that in addition to other dangers, there is a grave danger of Jacqueline losing her sanity. I would advise against you seeing her.
I don't get this. Miss Jacqueline was always so fond of you -- she was always talking about you - had your picture in her office.
Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village -	"The Dante."
Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right. I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby.
She's a pretty good sort.
Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.
The people at the restaurant?
That was Dr. Judd. He was phoning to say that, Jacqueline is on her way here -
I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you - you must know it -- but Jacqueline's my sister  whom I had lost and have found again....   
I'm going to find your sister.
She'll have to know some time.
No!
Please, Jacqueline.
I want you to see my room. I want you to see all of it.
It isn't that -- you said, "have to go." What could compel you --
And you believe that?
Ah, my Jason -- always laughing -- always trying to help others.  He's a good boy, Miss -- he just talks that way.
Why can't everyone be happy like we are -- laugh and have good times. Look at that poor little one  so sad because she can't find her sister. And that man with her - he doesn't make her laugh  he just sits and talks.
Why, Mr. Jason. Most of these books are on the closed shelf. You have to get permission.
Because there was another girl years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once - I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
Would they hurt her?
Is it about Jacqueline?
This is incredible I It must be some sort of a joke.
If I were you, Mary -- I'd go back to school. I'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline.
Yes  yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
I'm worry to bother you. I want to ask you about my sister.
No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door.
Miss Gibson, I'm tired of resting.
Because I have something very important to do.
I went back through the history last night. I read about Johann Rozenquartz -- I read what he wrote --
But he also wrote --
Oh, uh-huh.
Well...
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
Why? Didn't you know him well?
Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway.
So what about kids?
Do you want them?
So what's your personal thing? Are you really going to tell me something personal?
My therapist said that --
Aren't you?
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
Yes.
About sex?
You know?
But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you.
What will you do when the money runs out?
Tell me your name.
Yes.
Is he going to see this?
I don't see what difference it makes, I mean, I can think what I want.  I don't know if I want to do this anymore, I'm afraid... I don't mind answering the questions so much, but if somebody were to see this...
Yes.
The problem was me. I was... I was a pathological liar. Or am, I should say. Lying is like alcoholism, one is always "recovering".
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
Like maybe a big part?
Graham and I were talking about apartments and I told him to check the Garden District, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff.
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
What?
Why?
Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!!  Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him.
Answer me, godammit!! Did you make one of those tapes?
You son of a bitch!!
Yes, I remember. What do you do when these moods overtake you?
Well, last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities, and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem.
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
It's possible that Graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists. Perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with, and he would like to see other people, you for instance, wallow in their situation just as he does. Do you think that's possible?
That you are under no obligation to me?
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by.
A card? For her fiftieth birthday?
Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.
Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.
Because I wanted to.
I wanted him to see me.
In front of him, Ann, yes.
Listen to you!! You sound like Mom. What are you talking about?
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here?
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
Nope. I think the man is a liar.
Oh, okay. I think I get it.
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?
About what?
Would anybody else see the tape?
How long will it take?
Do I sit or stand?
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
I am now recording. Tell me your name.
Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
What did he say?
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
I have a friend coming in from out of town, I'll probably be spending some time with him the next couple of days.
I wish you'd quit that bartending job.
Hello.
Hello.
What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
It won't. I trust him.
I wish I didn't have to live someplace.
What tapes?
John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
Answer him, goddammit!!
May I ask who's calling?
Jesus!
Another kiss?
Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?
Do you want to make love? You're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. You're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. Do you want to make love?
Want me to breathe deeply?
Good shape for an old man, eh?
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology.
Well, let's wait for the X-rays.
I know. You're bored already. Transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?
Right. It's crazy. But here's the beauty part. Ready?  Who cares?
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?
OK, I bite. What does it look like?
GOT MY HEM SO HIGH THEY'LL SAY I'M BEING CHEEKY
BREAKING OUT
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
I know, I know, it's just...
Dear old Bert's settled everything.
I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this.  We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips!
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR COMPASSION
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EACH OTHER
Oh, Harry.  What are we going to do?
LIKE A VIRGIN WITH AN' URGIN' IN A SURGERY I'LL BE SWINGING -- I'LL BE BRINGING OUT THE NURSE IN ME
Could you tell us a little about it?
Could I do that later?
I NEED SOME
No!  He's never done that before.
This is the nerve center of operations, Janet.  You must stay here tonight.  That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.
WHAT A JOKE...
CRIMINAL
So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...
And none of them worked?
You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
Really? Because I don't know, I was thinking that --
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
They're from both of us.
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious.
She was good for you.  And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right?
Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
What happened to you guys?
Hiya.
Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
Yeah.
Oh, that's tasty.
And?
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
You know, you could work in a wine store.
Are you chewing gum?
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
Here's to my last week of freedom.
Sure I know Maya.
The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
What do you think?
Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall.
Stop it. You are blowing a great opportunity here, Miles. Fucking Maya, man. She's great. She's cool. She's funny. She knows wine. What is this morose come-down bullshit? These girls want to party. And what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come on!
You should call her.
Hey, there you are.
Does she know about Saturday?
Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes. She's not uptight or controlling. She's just cool. Things are so easy with her. Smells different. Tastes different. Fucks different. Fucks like an animal. I'm telling you, I went deep last night, Miles. Deep.
You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
Been checking your messages?
We're on.
What's that supposed to mean?
See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that.
Well?
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
You know what I'm thinking?
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
We gotta go back.
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
Love you, man.
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
Yeah, weird. But great.
What's the title?
Well...
Can I ask you a personal question?
Bathroom over there?
You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.
Hello?
Ken.
I guess I just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and I just, I just --
Universally rejected. Strike three.
Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
How much skin and stem contact?
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
Cabernet Franc.  This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc. It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year.
That was fun last night.
Huh.
See you, Miles. You take care.
I got the bat at home... On the wall.
I cursed.
Pharmacy crowded?
Morgan, be careful.
Do you feel comforted?
They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.  They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion.
Chicken Teriyaki.
Should we turn off the lights?
He was only a year and half old.
We won't be able to get out of there.
It's getting stronger.
How many died?
He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.
Dad.
We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.
Did someone save me?
Second thing this week I can't explain.
Okay.  So he was tall?
Is anything missing?
But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.
Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend opened up on me.
That's all over as far as I'm concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied.
Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye?
I've got my people sitting down there...  ...swatting flies and raring to go.
Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends.
Offend anybody lately?
Jefferson City?
South of here, past Chimayo.
They got a saloon there?
Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry.
Where you been?
You might make a farmer yet.
Where is Rae?
Who?
J.T.'s done everything he can. I married a brave man. Augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking.  McKendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so J.T. can't even get the law enforced.
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
Get out. We have nothing to talk about.
Why come to me?
Why are they doing this, Mal?
I heard from Stella you were trying to find Jake. What happened to Emmett?
He must be pretty good.
Hello, Cobb.
I thought we talked about that.
My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon.
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?
Is this a fair mix?
You really are a gambler.
I've got a place I can hide her.
It's an advance. We want him to know he's going to be happy here.
-- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.  I'm just trying to understand.  All these films, TV appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood -- all fake.  This is fake, this is fake -- fake, fake, fake, all fake.
Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?
The public decides who's on that list.
Sorry I didn't get her back in time.
Whatever.  I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.
Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
-- You can't go in there!
Are you and Simone...  ... getting married?
Is Simone back to earth yet?
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?
This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone.  What woman can?
Oh, Viktor.  You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this.  But in the morning, you'd go back to her.  What man wouldn't?
-- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --
I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?
Where are you?
Mom, do you miss Dad?
I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart.  She was the most vital woman I ever met.
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
What?... What did you say?
Simone?
-- Simone, the question on everyone's mind is simply... "why?"
That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
Your mother couldn't make it?
There was no other way.
How?
You know me -- married to my work.
Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now.  She broke up with Kent.
You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake.
So they're probably here.  You might be able to sell this 'disappearing act' to the rest of the world, but I'm not buying it. What's really behind this Simone woman?  The public has a right to know.  Why is she staying out of sight?  And why the hell is she with you?  I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Viktor, but you're not exactly Cecil B. DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
Nice boat, Taransky.
What now, Sayer?
Is it a jamming device?
Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
It's a hotel.
Would you like me to read?
You mean they buy it?
Maybe he can.
Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
I just needed to do a couple of things.  And I needed to tell you something.
Goodnight, Malcolm.
I forgot your name.
No.
Everybody got upset. They had a meeting. Momma started crying.  I don't draw like that anymore.
I walk this way to school with Tommy Tammisimo.
What kind of words?
No.
How often do you see them?
Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
You weren't a paper champion.
You really look better.
It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
They're right here.
There's only two of us.  Maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid it nicely in your drawer?  Is that what happened?
Communicate?
You know that accident up there?
Someone got hurt.
A lady. She died.
Where is she?
They?
You see ghosts, Cole?
I don't like people looking at me like that.
I don't know how else to look--
How did you--?
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering--
I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school.
'Course, it's none of my business.
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
Fuck you.
Bitch.
Come on --
Gene.
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
Thought your boy and his band were only staying the night.
Should we be doing this, dude?
He means moon shining.
I'm your son. And Laureen's son.
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
It's time to make amends.
Never heard of it.
Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.
You know what they say about men who need big guns...
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break.
Is that right?
Time for a little... "feedback" guys. That guy from Hectic Records --
You're... limping.
Mac... let's get out of here.
Get out of here.
Yeah. Great work, Rod. But next time, it would be nice... if you could JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!
Where's Mac?
It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines.
Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
How are you going to find him?
Maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?
How about Brenda?
He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
What the hell are we going to do?!
You dig that rat out of the hole?
Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?
Welcome home.
Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your -- ?
Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
When one sees you they all see you.
Kate McConnell.
Why? You have a bowling date?
So tell me about yourself.
Can I ask you something?
You know, my mother was a dancer, too. Her big shot was the touring company of 'Brigadoon.' She's been married three times. To a redneck, a poet and her tennis instructor.  See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous. I was nervous when I first got into the car. Now I'm scared shitless.
Well?
Hey...
By stealing my car?
Yeah.
He's just exhausted.
I should've told you, but you would've thrown me out, right?
What are you thinking?
Sure I can't interest you in anything else?
Whadda we have to do -- kidnap the Pope?
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
What are you doin' now?
I hate to say I told you so.
Bandit I, do you copy?
I'm still trying to ditch this Texas Smokey. I don't know what the sucker wants.
Talk to me.
Breaker. Breaker.
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
It ain't ever been done before, hot shit.
Uh-uh. What Cobra?
But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
That crazy sumbitch made it.
It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.
C'mon Bill... you've got some Sultan up there, one of your whales, big- spender, likes a lot of space, you cook up this "construction" thing...?
Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall- to-wall major felony offenses, murder, extortion, arson, grand larceny --  -- A paternity suit... I just feel like we're playing catch-up with all this and we shouldn't be.
So he has no idea what's about to happen?
...I forgive you Darwin.
Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude.
Are you on a land line?
-- Forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. Sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest.  Buddy, nobody knows about your condition, or your drug use. Why you lied to me, knowing that I'd find out anyway, I'll never know, but it imperative now that I see you.
So I guess you're not going.
Y'ain't never had to wash another man's blood off, dig it out y'fingernails... Y'had us for that. Y'ain't ever made a real beef on y'own, shit as light in the ass as you are, I'll bet you ain't ever made anything more than a fuck'n fist your whole life.  So if you think I'mma let your lil' punk-ass, with the dirt I've done for you, in the eleventh hour, sell me off like some fucking field nigger, hand me up to the Feds like y'last chip, then you done gone straight out-your-motherfucking MIND!
FUCK YOU!
-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --
Buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it...
Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of "The Turnpike Murders" that was Sparazza.
So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche, the mention of Israel's heart?
I can't discuss --
The agents of that era are all dead and gone, history had defaulted to fable... until now. You can imagine the shock this sent through the corridors of power in D.C. Heller's op predates the second world war. That's over sixty years of intel. Do you know how valuable that could be? The man's a treasure trove.
I'll overlook what you've done here today in light of what's taken place. You've been fully debriefed. Now I want you to return to D.C. immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter. I mean it. It's closed.
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
... Jesus... what for?
No shit.
Buzzy... Buzz...?
Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the scout, the sitdown, y'musta felt it from 'em then huh?
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
I feel like I know you girl. I feel like I've known you forever.  You gonna lemme see your scars?
Nuthin', we cool. There was somethin' about a fed being in the building.
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
...Shhhhhhit... girl, there's these two dudes, just sittin' here in this elevator, all shot up...
Forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent finders fee for me.
Listen --
Where's Snow?  Did you call him?
You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
Tell me.  I won't think you're insane.
Was her breakfast conversation that bad?
Personally, I think it's God.  At least, it fits my definition.
Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  I don't think so.
You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that --
If God is beyond our comprehension, and she --  -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?
Why do you think she hasn't suggested that?  It's the most obvious solution: Escape.  She knows she can't leave here --
When did this happen?
I need to see Snow.
"And Death Shall Have No Dominion".
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
You go home.
Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
Where've you been?
Seven, eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up.  I was a threat.  Now I know why.  She was afraid she'd be seen.  That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right?  I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on.  I guess that's part of the reason why --
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
What's wrong.
What are you talking about?
Why did she do it?
You said he was dead.
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
Chris --
Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
Is that really what you want?
I wish you wouldn't.
You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
He won't do it.
We thought you'd be alone.  We want to talk about...
And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
Looks a little constipated to me.
What did he say?
You were reading my Renoir.
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
It was nice having you "watch over me"...
Claire?
Stop being nuts!
You don't want to know.
Oh yeah.  When is it?  This thing in Queens.
What a memory.
I'd miss my life...
"For"...?
I like your coat.
You're planning to speak?
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
Keep what handy?
Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own.  We can afford it now.
So how'd it go?
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?
What did she say the down payment was?
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today?  He misses you...
Even Joey Venza?!
They're operating on him.  He's still alive.
No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up!  He told me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone!  He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away!  Koontz, please!
Wasn't your fault.
Yes.
Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table!
Nice threads Dad.
Time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
Here you go, Pete.
Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline.
Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--
"Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."
Are you okay?
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
Maybe I was hiding.  For years, I never told Ben the one important thing.
I hate the Platonic idea of you.
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
You should write that one down.
Some prep school thing.
You'd feel what?
Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?
Waldos.
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
There's nothing in there worth stealing!
I'll introduce you.
A match made in heaven.
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
Poison emergency.
Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
Creation? Or its opposite?
Mr. Parker.
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
He'll try to finish his experiment.
A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.
Loonytunes.  And yet...
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
Don't let him kid you. Cagney couldn't have pulled a sweeter job.  All right, boys. We were waiting in the depot in Frankfurt, see? And there was an ammunition train coming through, the longest ammunition train you ever saw, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room, see? Fixes himself a time bomb, busts open the window and just as the train moves out, lays the thing in there, see? So then, he comes out like nothing's happened and three minutes later you can hear it -- boom! Broke every window in Frankfurt. It was gorgeous!
What's wrong with him?
Jawohl.
Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.
What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?
I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?
If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy? Or Security?
So long, Cookie. The department store is all yours. What's left of it.
Private property, bub.
Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
Have a cigar.
Put me down for ten, you louse.
What some brandy?
Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
I'm okay here. Why bother?
Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!
When you get going on those broads, think of me!
Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
I'll kill you, Harry -- so help me!
To the Brick Kremlin!
Harry -- I'm blind!
Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
Come on, Animal -- let's trip the light fantastic!
But it's not just those legs. It's that nose of yours I'm crazy about. That cute little button of a nose!
We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone.
How do they know?
Who did?
What are we going to do with him?
Yeah?
Or how about a game of pinochle? No, you're not a pinochle man. You're a chess player.  I haven't played since I was a kid. Let's see --  -- a pawn moves this way, doesn't it? And a bishop this way? And the queen -- every which way, doesn't it?
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
December seventh, forty-one.
The what?
Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
From a chicken, bug-wit.
You must have been some tail gunner!  Go ahead, Cookie.
So you're stuck with me, eh?
You're not disposing of those Russian broads?
I thought he was the Chief Engineer.
Where is he now?
Target their Bridge.
Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
Really? What do you feel?
We're within range, sir.
Well, may we have a look around?
Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft thrusters ahead one quarter, port and starboard at station keeping.  Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if you would give the order to get underway.
I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
Oh
But I do have a theory...
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you.  I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.
Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
Enterprise maintaining full impulse power...
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
Response?
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
Hello, sir. It's David.
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
My readings indicate great instability.
.          .. Spock's tube...
What is it?
Saavik... My god, what happened to them?
Why?
I don't understand.
Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb.
I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
Mr. Scott?
Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.
Good shooting, Scotty.
... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly...
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
Will you be able to handle that...?
Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
David?... David!
Wait! Give me a chance --
Yes, I was...
... He spoke of your friendship.
Bones!...
What about Spock?
Share this with no one.
I give two minutes. For you, and your gallant crew.  Take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily!
Range: 3000 Kellicams.
Firing range, sir.
Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
You're not going in there -- !
Say thank you.
What DO you want? Damn it, why isn't there a girl here? You know this has nothing to do with age. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies.
Don't mince words, Bones; tell me what you really think.
Shore leave, Admiral.
I've got the sick bay ready. Will someone please tell me what is going on?
Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm <u>still</u> in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis?
Khan could be down there!
They even killed the galley chief.
Go? <u>Where</u> are we going?
Hours instead of days, Saavik; now we have minutes instead of hours --
But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
... Can't read you... repeat...
How can you let them pull that stuff on you? They're just lazy.
Well, don't have kittens. Genesis is going to work. They'll remember  you in a wreath with Newton, Einstein, Surak...
I've tried to warn you. Scientists are always pawns of the military --
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!
A criminal, Captain -- a product of the late 20th Century genetic engineering --
Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk was only doing his duty! You --
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
I suppose I was.  I poured a drink. Would you like it?
It was just words.
I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry.
What are you looking at?
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
No!
Tactical!
I don't know you. But you. I never forget a face. Mister Chekov, isn't it?  I never thought to see your face again.
Scotty -- what's left?
Uhura. Can't you augment?
She's not responding...
Mr. Scott on discrete.
On screen.
... No response, sir.
Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself.  Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
<u>WHY</u>?
Admiral, I've got to take the mains off the line. The energizer's shaken loose and I can't get in there to fix her -- radiation --
Meaning you can't even beam us back?
Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?
I know of your fondness for antiques.
Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate.
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
Admiral, you can't give him Genesis...
A distinct possibility.
I think we can guarantee she'll follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego.
Admiral, they're reducing speed.
Sporadic energy readings port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn.
Spock!
Any suggestions, Admiral?
May I speak, sir?
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
Saavik, get us out, best speed!
Admiral on the bridge!
Sir, you did it.
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?
You -- sent them away. Without even letting me say goodbye?
Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix-up Would you believe I was never told about your visit?
Well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive.
What did you say she was getting?
Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past.
Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b.
No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.
"Neutralized?" How?
They are mature humpbacks, weighing 45,000 pounds each. They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were brought here. We call them George and Gracie.
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
They're gonna hafta take their chances.
Do you trust me?
How will that be done, exactly?
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
What's that?
Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
I'm all ears.
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
Where are you going?!
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
Ready to engage computer, Admiral.
Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
Well, Spock, thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck, we are in the streets of San Francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales.  How do you propose to solve this minor problem?
Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: "Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...
You've done it before. Can't you remember?
Status?
Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...
Ready sir.
I'll have bearing and distance for you, sir.
I can't, sir -- Nothing!
Scotty, how long is this bay?
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
It's going slow, sir. It'll be well into tomorrow.
I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie...
Full power, sir.
The explosive override -- ?
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
Professor Scott, if you'll --
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
Ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira.  Ah... Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life.
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
Will it?
I wonder if you're aware of the trust you endanger, Jean-Luc Picard. In my experience, it's unusual for...
Jak'tahla?
How is it a woman like you never married? And don't tell me you "just haven't gotten around to it yet"...
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...
Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child...
Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.
Why not...?
Anij!
No... I want to stay with you...
Can he breathe under water?
To many offlanders, what you have here would be more valuable than gold-pressed latinum.  And I'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you.
Very funny...
She's stabilizing.
I'm showing fresh air  behind this calcite formation, Captain...
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
They're following the kelbonite deposits... using the interference to block our transporters...
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
Full impulse.
Commander, I'm showing two Son'a ships on an intercept course.
They need us to mediate some territorial dispute...
Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...
Deck five.
Prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours.
Bridge to Captain Picard. We are approaching sector four-four-one.
Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out...
Doctor Crusher asked to talk to you when you returned...
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...
Why would we be involved with these people?
Exactly as the simulations predicted...
Good hunting. Hayes out.
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
He's stable... for now.  But it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
You think they're still up there?
Is it Japanese?
His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator.
You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?
No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...
What year is it?
Mister Data, I want to know the exact date and time.  Give me a damage report on that missile silo.
But now... they are all one with the Borg.
Did you know her?
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
Captain --
What's still there?
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
The Vulcans should be out there right now. We need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we're going to get their attention.
Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it?
What makes you say that?
We?
Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them.
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes.
Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.
Report.
Good luck, sir.
I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success.
A ship-wide decompression has been initiated!
We saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data.
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
Emergency override!
I remember it made me sick.
Worf to Bridge.
Worf? Is something wrong?
Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
They may be trying to send a message to the other Borg...the Borg in this time period...
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed...
Pity they're retiring us just as I was starting to understand you, Spock...
No!
Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.
- <U>Kobayashi Maru</U>...
Specifically of...?
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
ABSOLUTELY NOT!
Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen.  Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
Are you carrying a surgeon?
Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
I didn't have the knowledge of Klingon anatomy I needed.
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
What?
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair, Captain James Tiberius Kirk. I put it to you, Captain, that you were seeking revenge for the death of your son.
As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
Mr. Chekov, take us forward, thrusters only, one half impulse power...
Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe's deep in Klingon territory. If we're discovered...
You must have cursed yourself, for having programmed our data banks, Lieutenant. Only they revealed something wrong aboard Enterprise.
Chancellor, may I present Commander Spock, whom I believe you know, Dr. Leonard McCoy, chief medical officer, Montgomery Scott, chief engineer...
And your coat.
I know how to get outside the shield.
Stand down your weapons.
As you were. Lieutenant...?
We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
Just the prototype.
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
Lieutenant, I am pleased to see you.  The Lieutenant is the first Vulcan to be graduated at the top of her class as the Academy.
I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace -
I don't believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy...
I SHOULD have been -
Close enough to beam down?
Captain, perhaps we're going about this the wrong way; our job is to get to the conference; HER job will be to stop us.
What's she waiting for?
Control tower, reading, Sir.
You have done well, Saavik. As your sponsor at the Academy I have followed your career with... satisfaction. And as a Vulcan.
How did you - ?
A lie?
Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too - about having faith.
In nineteenth century France, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines, flung their wooden shoes - called SABOTS - into the gears to stop them. Hence the word SABOTAGE.
Sir?
I have confirmed the location, sir, but...
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains - however improbable - must be the truth.
I don't think Starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament.
Do you know who I am?
It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.
The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.
Geordi equipped me with the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit. I recommend you use it to return to the Enterprise.
What do you imagine this is?
Ready, Captain.
We are being hailed.
Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.
What purpose does this serve?
It's you.
No.
If you wouldn't mind.
May I have this dance?
Counselor.
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.
It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
Cannon fodder.
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
Prepare for a site-to-site transport.
 Believe me, we don't under- stand it either. You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.
Sir, we're being hailed.
Coordinate our attack with the Valdore's tactical officer. Triangulate fire on any shield impacts.
What's this?
Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols  -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here, we are.
Not very chatty.
Report.
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
Anything.
I am, Commander Riker...  May I touch your hair?
On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
Were we always explorers?
Looking up at the stars.
With a full head of hair.
In time, Jean Luc.
Hello, Jean Luc.
What are you doing?
I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.
Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.
Target disruptors. Destroy them.
Deploy the weapon. Kill everything on that ship. Then set a course for Earth.
This is a mistake.
The bond is broken.
Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
What did I tell you?
Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here.
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?
Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
Please...
Please...
What?
What?
No gas... car dead.  We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas.
Shit.
What?
What is...  ...Coke?
Sun...
Eh... yes...
No... The closest...
Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay.
Well... I'm going to go now.
Goodbye.
Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
You did? That's funny. So did we.
The captain...
I like this music.
I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?
This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
You are cold.
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
Well...
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
Wait. Could I have your autograph?
Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
I'm telling you they're probably friendly.
They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
You have no conception of this, do you?
This has always been my favorite time of day.
No, sir. Radar.
Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
I told you...
Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
Bullshit politics.
Okay, let's get you wired up.  I hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors.
You said you were going to get her out of this.
The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head.
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
Cut it out, Tran.
Faith, call me, okay?
Hi, baby.  I've missed you.
You have to go.  I mean it.
No.
Talk to me about costs, here.
I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--
Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
How did you hook up with Faith?
I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?
Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist.
Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.
Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
What the fuck are you doing?
Jesus, Lenny.
She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.
Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
No it doesn't.
The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough.  You want to rub my neck?
How's Zander?
You better keep a low profile for a while.
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
This is bad.
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
There's a plus side?
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
Alright.  We're going up.
Was this him?
...well, there was some friction: I wanted to write up my work, educate the public, but Koessler wouldn't allow it. Low felt Koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers. Koessler had Low reassigned to the Pacific Northwest, Seattle. You know when they say, stick it where the sun don't shine? That's where they stuck Dick Low.
Anybody talk to the press?
Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
Jesus.
You... surprised me.
Yeah.
What?
Excuse me?
My God.
You're a... you're sick.
The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
What did he look like?
There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.
An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford.
Speck's the killer all right. We got box loads of evidence. Did 'em all the same way: torture, strangulation. Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count.
Nada. Vague description, that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car, the diner: no fingerprints, no trace evidence.
Sorry to interrupt you, sir, but I thought you'd like to know.
I'll relay this to CIIAC.
Its called insubordination.
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
Agent Mackelway, you're going to get your wish. You're going back to Washington. I want you back in Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat rooms.
I'm hesitant to...
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
We're waiting for trace evidence results on the Rice killing.
Why did you go to Chicago?
There was talk of a file photo.
Miss me, Dave?
Thanks for the ride.
You work with Koessler?
This is a sexy case.
What about the chat rooms themselves?
That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
What's that?
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
When you were his student? Did he come on to you?
It's a no-no.
You mean --
Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.
It's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong.
You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
Mack must think Zero has a police band.
Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?
Who are you?
What was your weakness, sir?
Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.
And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.
We're alike. We are hunters. We have the gift. It's ancient times all over again. We stand between order and chaos. I need help. I can't carry on alone.
Is he dead?
[Reality very risky.]
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
Thomas Mackelway.
No.
I don't...
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
Are you calling Her?
Don't do it, Mike.
How are you ladies doing this evening?
I like quiche.
Well, I left someone very special behind.
Like what?
Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.
...not until you book it...
Why don't I just wait three weeks and tell her I was cleaning out my wallet and found her number...
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
You haven't told then, huh?
I know what you're saying, man. I don't know what to tell you...
Always...
The poor thing. Six years?
He's so sweet. He really said that?
A couple of high rollers like you?
You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
Why not?
You said there are advantages to being single. I want to know what the advantages are.
Well... This is it.
Can I give you a ride to your car...?
...Which one...?
Lorraine?
Hi, Lorraine. Thanks for holding on.
...Yeah, with the baby in the tire. One time I started to cry right in front of Pierre...
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her.
Well that sucks.
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
It's definitely a step back for me.
Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.
I didn't mention her once today.
I'll give you an eight. 
Sounds more like Aids...
I got to at least try once.
No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.
Thanks, man.
Sorry about what happened at the Dresden. I had no idea...
You should play another team. The Kings are bitches in this game.
Pause it. 
She was cute.
You asshole. Why are you carrying a gun? What? In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg?
...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Are you ready to order?
Tonight, baby.
I can't lose more than a hundred.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
They're all skanks.
That's not cool.
That's where we make our scene.
Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
Mikey's the big winner.
What an asshole.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
I'm too tired for this. Let's just go.
That's bullshit.
"Big Brother", "Little Brother"?
...So give me the fuckin part...
Christy was nice...
...a day...
I hear she's getting real fat.
How you guys doing?
Please, don't mess with me right now...
It's not like that...
Oh, it's on, baby...
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
...shivering...
You're money.
It's on.
Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.
No.  You ask for too much.
Maybe three, four times.  I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no.  Things have been so smooth the last ten years...
You look terrif on the floor!
My compliments.  I'll take care of them from my share.
I kept trying to call you after my divorce and Tom always said you were busy.  When I got the Wedding invitation I knew you weren't sore at me anymore, Godfather.
You look terrible.  I want you to eat well, to rest.  And spend time with your family.  And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want.
My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
I see you have your Luca Brasi.
Don Tommassino.
I know.
I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
Beautiful all over, eh?
You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful.  That doctor did some job on your face.
Mike!  The party starting!
Who are those girls?
Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him.
We should hear what they have to say.
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
The Don was slipping; in the old days I could never have gotten to him.  Now he's dead, nothing can bring him back.  Talk to Sonny, talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio...it's good business.
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?
Mike, why am I out?
Christ, Tom; I needed more time with him.  I really needed him.
Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all.  I guess you've figured it all out?
What time do they expect us?
Would you like me better if I were a nun?
I have to see my father and his people when we get back to the Mall.
We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets.
Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me.
Tell me!
Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm down at the hospital.  I came down late.  There's no one here.  None of Tessio's people--no detectives, no one.  The old man is completely unprotected.
Mikey, you look beautiful!
Do you wish to be baptized?
Let us fill up our Regimes.
Buy me out?...
I think so.  Detective squad?
You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.
Uncanny!
Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast. It's not love it's the coffee machine.
Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open.
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
You know, a primer.
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother.
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
I could fuck this icebox I love it so much.  What were you actually doing in New York?
Do you have any brothers?
What does he say?
She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.
The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious --
Dick -- you've got to hear this!
No. No, I'm staying here for a few days, in Rome. That's a new piano, so you prob --
I don't know, I don't know, I just know it.
That ring's so great. The green one.
I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me?
Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited...
Oh my God. Tom.
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home.  I'm going to go home.
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
What?
He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me.
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
No, we're meeting another friend. Tom Ripley.
What's your secret?
Which is?
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
Of course. Aunt Joan.
Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore Roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
Questa lettera e stata trovata nell'abitazione del signor Richard Greenleaf a Roma.
Well hurry, before we sink.  Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
What rumour?
He's already angry, I don't think --
Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
I keep wanting to do that -- fling open the door -- let the light in, clean everything out. If I could get a huge eraser and rub everything out... starting with myself... the thing is, Peter, if...
Are you okay?
Was that Meredith?
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
I really don't want to see anybody.
Was it? Did you speak to Tom?
That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge Sherwood.
Thank you.
How much to get a permit to carry?
Nah, this'll be fine.
You like ball games?
Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
Yes?
Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
What kind of people?
Really?
What did you do?
Huh?
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". 
You didn't have to spend your money -- ?
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
Huh?
What about the record?
Tom, come here a moment.  I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  And don't forget to add the new photo releases.
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.
He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
No, I'm serious, really...
Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.
Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge..."
Yeah. We went to Harvard together. 
Fuckin' One-Ball.
20 bucks?
I don't remember.
Don't you want to go?
But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
You a narc?
Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
Travis, what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most?
There must be something...
Got your license?
You kiddin? Who else would hack through South Bronx or Harlem at night?
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
Who?
Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man?
Here, officer, take me in. I'm clean. I didn't do it. Got a ticket once in Jersey. That's all. Honest, officer.
Anything you say, officer.
So howsit?
Real down.
Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.
Like do anything, you know.
What do you expect, Bertrand Russell? I've been a cabbie all my life, what do I know?  I don't even know what you're talking about.
Maybe.  Not really.
He says he's leaving the island sir.
Motor oil?
Wait.
Partners?
You knew?  All this time?
God's speed.
I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
That's my girl!  Did you...?
I think  it's worse  now.
He doesn't remember anything, Delly.  Doesn't know how he got here, doesn't remember his father, the town, the Bijou, anyone...
Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed?
City hall?
We were in love... weren't we?
This is strange.  Do you feel it?
You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...
Huh.  That was nice of me.
... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.
I see...
Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
C'mon, I'll give you two a lift back to the Bijou.
I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
And... what's my name again?
But I...
And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make.  What are those?
Why don't you two get out there and dance?
Ha!
Pete... go home.  Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy?
Any idea how you got here, son?
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
Do you remember if you were driving a car?  Maybe you went over the bridge.  No guard rail there, it's easy to do.  It's happened before.
That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy.  Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does.
That's where you live.
What's wrong?
You smell gas?
You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk.
However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles.  Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.
Why not?
Peter, I'm an agent.  I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you.  That's what I do.  You're a writer.  You write pictures. That's what you do.  And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.
Oh god, oh, god, no, I...
That was beautiful.
That's my r-r-rent.
Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?
What happened?
I suppose.  Thanks.
They all know you?
Who?
Miss Hayworth?
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
Did you drive up from San Francisco?
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
Thank you.
How do you like our little hamlet?
I guess you knew that, anyway.
I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
I did.
And the second?
Yes.
Mother!
Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
Why are they trying to kill people?
Mitch, let's turn back.
Do you know him?
Yes, but where?
And the white house?
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
Daniels.
The little girl's name.
Yes?
Thank you.
Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to understand. This young lady says there was an attack on the school.
Lovebirds, I see.
She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
She was selling birds.
When?
We won't be here.
What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
No.
I couldn't ask you to.
Well, if there's anything else I can do, Mitch...
He was killed last night. By birds.
Is that for Mitch Brenner?
Sixty...  Oh.
How?
What are you? A policeman?
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
We... we went to school together. College.
So you came up to see Annie, huh?
I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
Can't see a thing.
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
I do different things on different days.
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's not a job, of course. I just take it because...
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
Melanie...
The town looks clear.
Have we still got power?
Where are they heading?
You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
Well... well, how soon would you want them?
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
Yes, all right, I'll wait for you. Good-by. 
Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...
Help how? What do you want to do?
How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish.
Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
I don't think I can go on, sir.
Well --
I don't know that -- neither do you.  This subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --
But, I didn't ask him to kill.
I've just been to see Mrs. Marsh. Georgina is doing splendidly.  The incision has healed -- clean and fine -- but she doesn't seem to have any desire to walk.
See that, Fettes?
This is not a woman!
What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?
Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
Toddy hates me.
Now that wasn't a friendly thing I heard, Toddy.  Not at all friendly.
You say you've come here on your own account?  No one knows you are here?
But where did they get those people?
Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once.  But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
She would if she could.
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
Two down. Two to go.
Where is it? This place?
That was a fucking hollow point!
You killed her. I saw it.
We're going to play a little game called "Who's got the Scar."
Yeah, no kidding.
I know who you are.  That's why you paint your face. To hide.
I've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. But what you're doing now, does. I don't know why.
From the bonfire over there. Look at it.
No...
No. You don't.
Erin. Who?
I thought we had an understanding. I thought we understood that discretion is paramount.
Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case.
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
I watched her grow up. Just like you. I know how her mind worked. She kept snooping around because she was worried about you. What you'd gotten yourself into. So stop blaming me. And blame yourself.
But you, you've had them.
What were you yelling about?
Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
You're in with them.
You killed her!
You should see it, Professor Barnhardt! You should go out and see it for yourself!
You have faith, Professor Barnhardt
It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
It is not enough to have men of science. We scientists are too easily ignored -- or misunderstood. We must get important men from every field. Educators -- philosophers -- church leaders -- men of vision and imagination -- the finest minds in the world.
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
Such power exists?
The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake.  You mentioned a demonstration of force--
Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
He gave these to you?
Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
The present situation?
You know about the United Nations?
I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--
We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations.
Good afternoon.  I'm glad to see you up and around.
We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. And the radio's still busted, so me can forget about the space man for today.
I wonder if we ought to--
How do you know?
Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
Well... we blew Plan A.
Okay.  Where's Nosferatu?
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
Whattaya mean?
We are awesome monster-bashers!
What is this, David?
Look.
You can't kill me, Star.
This is just our cover.  We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
I wish they were vampires so I could nuke them in their hearts.
Of course not!
Smells good.  When do we eat?
... And stay outta here.
Thanks, Grandpa...
I had the dream again about <u>them</u>.
He looks dead.
I'll hitch.
See you later.
Michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  Will you stay home with Sam tonight?  I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
I <u>didn't</u> invite you in this time!
Can I sleep in here with you tonight?
Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
Ohmygod...
So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy?  We've got it all.  Best selection in Santa Carla.
This looks terrific, Lucy.
Will somebody please tell me what this is all about!?
I'm Michael.
Ouch.
I wouldn't have given my Mom such a hard time about moving here if I'd known I was going to meet you.
Why not?
It's gone.  I feel it!
You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?
Did you spill something?
I'm making you a sandwich.
What happened, Michael!?
What??
We've got to stick together, Sam. You've got to help me.
Star.
All right... Box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol.
What the hell you looking at me like that for?
Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?
Look, I know it's hard to believe...
You can't let anybody leave!
Whatever that Norwegian dog was... It... It was capable of changing its form...  ... when it attacked our dog... it somehow was able to digest... or... absorb it... and in the process shaped its own cells to imitate our dog's cells exactly...  ... This for instance isn't dog at all -- it's imitation... We got to it before it had time to finish or...
Too damn dangerous.
Childs!!
Why didn't it imitate Fuchs?  Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits.
I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me.  But...
Cut that out, Copper.  Nauls?  What's taking you?!
I don't know how.  Because he's different than we are.  Because he's a space guy.  What do you want from me, anyway.  Go ask Blair.
... Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline...
... Ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up...
Not the only one.
Hey, Sweden!!!
Anything?
... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.
I'm getting worried about you.  You ought to have a checkup.
Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up...
Sanchez...?  Hey, who...
Tie up Clark, too.
How we going to try and find out who's... you know, who's who?
What is it?
Get your gear on.
What's happened?!
It's in between us and them!!  How we going to get back?!
You know of them?
My God... I saw this.
Machines?
This has to end.
What's your name?
And centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again, we couldn't.  Our adaptation was too successful.  We survived... we endured... for this.
She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
I'm tired of running.
You're late.
You promised me flowers.
Well there's something new.
Alex, what is it?
Why do we have to race for heaven's sake?!
... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
... One day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him. The thick brow, so lacking in imagination.  The dim little eyes, devoid of curiosity.
It's my Jamie's birthday today. Your godson.  He's nine years old. At his party he asked me if Uncle Alex was coming.  I told him no. Then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore.
You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
What happened to Emma will never go away.  It's part of you now and it always will be.  But you have to learn to live with it...
I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
And this would be my study.  There was an elm tree outside the window then.
How long did you travel?
We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you.  And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?
Oh, that explains everything.
That machine --
Why?
I don't understand.
Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
Those rocks, over there... they're the same... this is... Central Park.
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
Alexander, take my son away.  Take him back to your time.  Will you do that?
It was different then.
Yes, sir, he --
But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
My father has gone to a better place.
My fowl have polluted the yard.
Sir, if I may --
Hello, Mrs. Watchit.  You're looking in the pink.
Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer.
Relax.
You're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition.
Long live the Organization for the Organized!
Of people like you. People I was just trying to help. They couldn't get worse so I thought, with medication, they might get...
Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.
What? What are you thinking?
They've got lives to be grateful for.
You gotta stop thinking like that.
No. I don't want it to.
My God you look exactly like him.
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?
What about the world?
[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
Why don't you help me?
I'm not gonna let that happen.
William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.
Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.
Becker does? Are you sure?
I'm not sure.
Hon?
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
We spoke with a gentlemen today who says he personally delivered very close to that same amount to a Miss Louise Sawyer.  Do you know her too?
He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City.  He also says that at that time he met a man.  He identified you through a series of mug shots.  He also told us that you and Mrs. Dickinson seemed "close." Is that true?
Well, you're not exactly an expert witness, but what makes you so sure?
What kind of gun was it?
I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better.
Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel good.  I've been sick.
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
Louise, is that you?
What?
Tell me.
You're kinda the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.
Well, come on, gal, I got you a room.  You can go on in and take a nice cold shower.
Do you love me?
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
You didn't say what it was for, did you?
I'm the one... I never made it work. I just... It's not that I don't love you.  It's not that.  I just never thought I'd be thirty-six years old and I never thought... I don't know what I thought.  What do you want, darlin'.  What do you want me to do.
Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
Whose place is this again?
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
Exactly.
Shit!  I... I, which way?
Will I be?
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
That's puttin' it mildly.
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
You think you've found your calling?
You're disturbed.
Thelma.
I want you to call Darryl.
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
How'd they find out we're going to Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?
Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
I mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse.  I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it.
Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
I'm warning you, Thelma.  You better drop it right now!  I don't want to talk about it!
You do?
I think I've really fucked up.  I think I've got us in a situation where we could both get killed.  Why didn't we just go straight to the police.
Louise?
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  I mean, I just wanna know.
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
Louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car?
Me too.  I feel awake.
We've gone insane.
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
Then let's not get caught.
Are you going to apologize or not?
Hi!
Where you goin'?
Yeah... sure did.
Hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to scratch that thing, huh?
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted?
Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
Stop it!
Gay? He said you were gay?
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
Mary again.
Whatever happened to Mary?
I mean since then.
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
You mean he doesn't like bad guys.
Very nice.
This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
Oh yeah.
The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency... especially after what I did.  I lied to this poor girl. Lied, man. She deserved better.
I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?
Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.
Don't you want to know my name?
I work with retards.
I know he's around here someplace.
That grandmother of yours -- she's really something.
Lint?
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
Yeah.
So...
I guess.
All you want is a phone number?
Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. Now I want you to level with me: Did you knock this skirt up?
I think your life's about to change.
Mary's a little chubby, huh?
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
Hey, hey, hey!
Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
Do you know the... soccer stadium?
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid.
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
Oh... Sully.
Oh. Well I am.
I'd go with the seven.
No, it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs.'
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
I don't watch the new ones.
Pat's an architect, too.
Pat does projects all over the world.
What's up, Doc?
I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?
Oh he can hold you. He weighs two- hundred-and-thirty pounds.
So who you taking to the prom?
I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears.
Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?
Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.
Sure.
We should play some time... I mean, if you can afford to lose some money.
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.
Um, Ted, I need a moment with Magda -- would you let the dog out of the bathroom.
Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?
Go!
What what are you doing here?
But but what about Steve?
Yeah? What do you want?
What seems to be the situation here? You shit yourself or something?
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
No! I was pissing!
Eh.
It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you want.
Uh-huh.
Okay.  So is that a yes or a no?
Yes, Captain, you may proceed. Clear your guns.
Good.
Jack and Bobby are good men. But it takes a certain character, moral toughness to stand up to --
That is correct.
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
Is this the Chiefs' recommendation?
-- I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war!
So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?
Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
Hey, sport. You winning?
No choice. This is going to cost lives any way we go. Do nothing, and it could be 80 million of ours. We have to get rid of those missiles.
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.
Let's get out of here.
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesn't have to double-barrel me.
Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples.
Who are you?
I did.
Water. Worth killing for out here, I'd think.
Who is he?
They obviously wanted it to be known that they offed Leo. Some kind of statement.
I'd just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down.
She took something from the house. What she called a medicine bundle. Most likely Jimmy's.
Alright. Alright...
Bastards...
It may have been Maggie's way of saying "get off my ass."
And it was full of water when I drove by here three days ago. Full. I mean... a river.
What?!
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information.
Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
Why does he wanna see me?
What was he saying?
So what?
The owl told him about Leo. That's incredible. I guess we just broke the back of this investigation, didn't we? Evidence doesn't get any harder than that -- not for my money. Is there anyway we can seduce this owl into Federal Court?
It's not real.
Take care of yourself, Walter.
Not no more.
You tell me. You tell me who went to the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said I was messin' with your case, man. I don't give a goddamn about your case.
That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.
This Clear Moon's house?
Grandpa Reaches says you come from heavy Indian blood. I used to think Grandpa was gettin' senile. Now I know he is.
You burned an American flag today. And left it for me...
What?
X21, give me a 20.
You ever try solitary confinement?
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.
I thought he'd never leave.
Yes, ma'am.
Two.
It never came up.
I can't.
Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
What if he's not?
What about the plane?
I'm different.
That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
What he said..."There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result."
What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
You're totally insane.
Danger?
This is it, then.
No.
You say the truth.  Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?
Goose is dead.
Now?
Well?
Sir?
That's missile lock!
We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.
3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
You're not supposed to...
You hear that? Anything we want. Anything...Well???
What do you want?
What do you want?
The list is long, but distinguished.
So I've heard.
How was it?
Nice. Always a good idea to show up your instructors. He nods toward Jester, glaring at them from his A4. Goose indicates the backseat of the Tomcat.
What are you doing?
Hi...Hi there. How ya doing in there?  Mav... Ahhh...you know, at one point I did want a Navy career.
That's Kazanski.
She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't.
You're a hell of a flyer.  You can be my wingman any time.
The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
I've seen this before.
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
Why?
Twenty years' experience, I couldn't shake you. You may be a great flyer. I mean that.
Sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it... I served with your old man.
You may not think so, but you are.
What to the rebels want?
So, where to?
Lemme ask you a question.  Ever fuck a mutant?
What happened to number five?
The guy's a fucking asshole.
Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?
I say we throw the switch and see what happens.
Bob?
I'm with an very important client.
Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the corner.  Tiffany, you help him.  I'll destroy his file and refund his money.  And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid.
I'm listening.
Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
I've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure.  I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down.
HER!
Pull them out.
I don't know.
Why not?
What are you, my father?
You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.
Where?
I'm sorry.  Would you please rephrase the question.
Who?
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights:  Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course...  Venusville.
All right.
They'll be here any minute!  They'll kill you all!
Ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing?
I don't remember you.
What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?
Hauser, you're lost your mind.
I'm not falling for it.
So you dropped by to apologize?
What can I do?
Like what?
Where's this "reactor" come from?
Cohaagen knows it makes air.  But the bastard won't turn it on.
The whole core of Mars is ice.  The reactor melts it and releases oxygen.
Wait!
I can't believe it.  No tracks, no sign, no spoor.
Let's go you two.  We're headed for the mountains.
There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.
I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.
We're not going over there, right?
You're really leaving, huh?
Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?
Tammy Lynn Baxter.
Why don't his parents ever take him to Vegas with them?
Jeez, look at that guy.
You're full of shit.
Reckon he hated Perfection more than us?  You suppose he <u>wanted</u> to kill himself?
Here's the plan...We don't <u>even</u> stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we keep right on going.  We'll walk the horses.
Pham Van don't get his mitts on <u>this</u> for no measly fifteen bucks!
Son of a bitch!
Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!
Well...that's it.  We're not getting off this rock...
Use the fucking bomb!
What the hell are you doing?!!
Road's in!
Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
I'm dead.  Let's finish in the morning.
You sure this is where it was?
And I appreciate it.
What?!!  Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
Forensic ballistics isn't an exact science, is it?
Objection.
"We"?
Hey -- the fact you popped Jimmy Chin in broad daylight proves it wasn't premeditated. Jury'll sympathize -- dude was banging your wife, right?
We had information bearing on Mr. Kim's desire to gain admission into the Joe Boys by assassinating a member of a rival gang.
...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!
Don't tell me where to work. I moved to New York to work for Edward Dowd. But I can't believe that Edward Dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --
Ten years is a long time.
Where?
Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.
I feel like I've been mugged... Guy scared the shit out of me. You made your point, Eddie... I'm relieved we're not taking the case.
What other case?
-- Easy as that, huh?
A fucking wheelchair?
Goddam it... the little punk bests me again, I get thrown down and lectured at and where the hell were you?
So what're we gonna do?
Well, I mean, Roeder's gone, now... A dead end. Believe me, I'm sorry too, but...
You're carrying that around like it was a picture of your girlfriend!  I don't want to see your heart broken when this case crashes and burns!
-- What?
...Jesus!
How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?
You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs?
I embroidered.
I've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the Tri-state area. No one's heard of Chuckie Roeder.
Racist asshole came at me.
But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face?
But why?
Quite a bit you didn't tell me.
I did two tours in 'Nam...
...You told the Desk Sergeant you were certain Mr. Kim wasn't the killer?  You left your telephone number?
Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?
Edward T. Dowd.
I'm sorry if I've ruined your day, Mr. Reynard. But my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and --
Back in the Seventies I spent years putting away gangsters in a Colombian syndicate called "the Ochoa". These guys are very dangerous, Ed. When I hear that a small-time dope lawyer is conniving to spring one of these guys, I see red.
I see: He'd walk out next month.
Isn't it a standard trick to pack a line-up with men who resemble each other but look different than the suspect, so the suspect will stand out for the eyewitnesses?
Isn't it unusual for a man who's just committed a murder in plain sight to bring the weapon back to his apartment?
Yes, Mr. Dowd.
My skip-trace turned up two Cecil Stipes. One's in Butte, Montana. Other's at Riverhead Veterans Psychiatric.
Look. Mister --
Five years.
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
I think what Eddie wants to say is --
Tell me some other things about her.
No... No, go away.
No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative.
A basic kill. Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. My boys have been all over this. It's a dead end.
Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
GOT A MAP OF THE ENVIRONS OF THE YAKIMA INDIAN RESERVATION WITH YOUR NAME ON IT. BETTER BRING A POLE.
I cracked the Whiteman case with this.
And no one found the ring?
Where am I? And how can I leave?
Had the FBI here once before. Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place.
No.
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
Oh, the uncle is missing.
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
Maybe, later we could take a look.
Agent Desmond, it's...
When he says, "Discussion", how do you take that, Agent Desmond?
One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
Noooo...
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Oh god, Laura.
You want a muffin?
What are you doing?
Bob.
The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
No "Jacques". I am the Great Went.
That's right. She called me. She even asked me what your fathers looked like...
What the hell is wrong with you?
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
Dad.
Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?
Did you come home during the day last week?
Neither is mine. And can't we talk about something serious for a change.
Bobby didn't give you this?
What are you doing?
You're right. There's no one here.
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
He was accused of jury tampering.
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin...  ...nothing can make the woman well... but we try to compensate... to make a gesture...
What is the truth?
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
You know what that would mean?
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed...?
They lied.
I do. Yes.
That's not my handwriting.
Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
Neurology?
Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
Ed Concannon.
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Objection!
Whatever the 'truth' is, let's hear that. You were her doctor.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
You reached down into death. Now, isn't that right?
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
You know... sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
Yes.
Hi.
Mrs. Simmonds.
A single hour.
...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
I need an extension for my case.
Sustained. Yes. The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
I changed my life today. What did you do?
Really. How wonderful for you.
Maybe I can do something right.
Would you like me to leave...?  Is this a bad time -- ?
What happened...?
That's not the question. It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault? If I'd... if I'd... I never should have taken it. There was no way that I was going to win.
Well, then what are you doing here?
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
Thank you.
We find that your subscription lapsed...
...we, we love her, Dick and me...
I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will...
My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue...
What does it mean?  I... I mean we, you have other tactics...
I... please. My wife... my wife's prescription has run out. If I can call him...
...now who is that...?
...hey, I don't need your charity...
I have to talk to you.
Come on. Let's get a drink.
Are you out of your mind...?
You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
Who have we got?
What happened, Joey...?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
What the hell are you doing here?
We got a mistrial, you know. Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
What happened in those three...
Hurry up!  Jump in!
What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?
Aw, he isn't that good...!
Good to see you, General.  This is Pastor Collins, director of Civil Defense.  Sheriff Bogany, head of the local forces ... Miss Van Buren.
You'll hit something!  Can't you go higher?
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
A big family must be fun...I imagine it makes you feel you belong to something.
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
I've been as close to them as anyone. But not close enough for real observation...
They've blocked it!
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
What is that gizmo?!
A forlorn hope - but there is a chance.
It's about that meteor.  They say it's a whopper.  The District Officer phoned us at the lookout up on the summit. Thought you might be interested... It's ten or twelve miles from here - over by Linda Rosa.
There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!
I think somebody ought to check on it. Over.
I thought you'd killed Freddy off.
Which means he's having nightmares again?
Might as well be, Dylan.  State of the art animatronics enhanced with bio- organic grafting.  Bull tendons, nerve bundles from a Doberman, even half the brain of a homicidal primate was...
Like Freddy.
Was there any trigger event?  A trauma, shock or...  You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you?  The horror stuff?
Does he have to stay here over night?
Ms. Langenkamp.  I suggest you go home and get some rest.  Your son is fine. He's been taken downstairs for further testing.
He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
I want my kid out of here now!
Home.
What...what is that?
Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.
Everything went great, I thought.  We really got you, didn't we?
What...happened?
Freddy, for all I know.
Really?
Holy...
Heather Langenkamp?
Isn't there anyone that can stop him?
I don't know if it has, really.  With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it.  I'm working in television now.  The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy.
Of course he is.  Freddy's dead and gone.
Did we lose anybody?
That low passed through last night. May be a little bumpy out there.
You sound so sure.
Because we believed we could make an impact out here.  Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing.
Come in.
Everyone out of the rigging NOW!
But your instinct was to lose sail?
I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in.
Yeah, that's right.  You wanna come in and shake it for me?
I cheated to get on the boat!!!  All right?!
It's a ninety-one!  It's an 'A'!
I thought this was your dream come true.
Hey, shut up will ya?
Why'd you do it?
I feel like I got you into this.
What's on your mind?
Why do you think I'm sending him home?
The Dolphin was a symptom.
Does Phil know how you guys feel?
But you invited is aboard.
Your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-October.
What's wrong, you don't like steak?
Humor me.  Eat it anyway.
I need to know what I'm working with; what their boundaries are. Their lives depend on it, and for that matter so does yours.  We've got to bring them together.  Make them a crew.  We're as strong as our weakest link and I don't want to find that out the hard way.  So, I will challenge them and they will come together.
What?!  What's happening?!!
Son-of-a-bitch.
Don't ever call me stupid.
This isn't just a story!!  It's history made allegory.  It is a philosophical handbook for life!  It holds the secret of this very voyage.
They're waving... handkerchiefs or something.
Fuck off man.  It's just a fish.
Phil.  What are you doing?
No way Phil.  Not like this.
I don't know.  We gotta get 'im outta here before Skipper sees him like this.
Do you have something to say?
Swing up, son.
Don't look down.  Look in my eyes! Climb!  We'll do it together.
I can't be sure.
Yes.
Everybody knows why she went over Tod.  You jibed the boat.
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
He's so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts ain't quite my type.
Meetin' him at the gate. That phone call this afternoon was the signal. My deranged mama's hid the keys to my car. But of course, I know exactly where they are.
Y'all take American Express?
What's Cao Ben?
No.
No... I don't think so, man.
Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
How much money you have between the two a'ya right now?...
What is it?
Ain't never had no girl pull a blade on me.
No shit?!?! You know him?
Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.
You hitched yet?
That's what I mean... Always looked like you was just knocked out in love... Was real nice to see.
So, it's back to the islands.
But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
My name's George Kovich. Bet you've heard of me.
Only that it's supposed to be a pretty poor sight since the hurricane came through last year.
The same to you. If you are in Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and visit us. The Hondurans are great friends of the American people. But I have a joke for you before I go. If a liberal, a socialist, and a communist all jumped off the roof of the Empire State Building at the same time, which one of them would hit the ground first?
Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local shrimp boat captains is in jail now. These people are friends of mine, so I must return and find out what happened.
Gotta admit, you guys are -  two in four dozen.
You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me.
What is it, Johnnie?
I did, honey, but that was last night... Let's just find those two kids before it's too late.
You won't of missed much.
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
My daddy ain't never killed nobody, has he, mama?
Hey, my snakeskin jacket... Thanks, baby... Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom?
You have such a pretty, long neck, like a swan.
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
Hell, you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all.
That don't seem fair.
I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
Musta been a lesson tellin' ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out?
The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would "give him peace of mind." Nobody's seen him since.
Let's go dancin', peanut. I'm ready.
One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...
Sorry, baby... When's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?
When she got almost to the top step I stuck my hand between her legs from behind.
You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
It's huge. This musta been a grand old place at one time.
M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i... You can almost hear that jazz blowin' up from the big N.O.
Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
I really do think it's the best night of my life.
Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
Who do?
You think he saw us?
I wouldn't mind a little night life. How about you?
What's wrong, sweetheart? Somethin' botherin' you?
I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.
You upset with me?
We'll be alright, peanut, long as we've got room to move.
Oh God, Sailor.
I can't take this, Sailor. She's dyin' right in front of our eyes...
Not bad for eleven dollars a day.
I'm gonna stay here in this room, Sailor. I don't feel so good? This heat makes me tired.
A little, I think... Darlin'?
Darlin', I still ain't feelin' so well. I'm goin' to bed.
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.
That man's a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, you'll regret it. If you live to.
What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
The reptiles were supposed to be of a docile species, said a senior government official, but it seems the breeders bungled and reared attack crocodiles.
I'm fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry.
I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.
Explain it... I told you.
Shoot him? Like with a gun?
Where?
Through the forehead?
You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.
I got your message... But you went right to Johnnie, didn't you?... I can't trust you, bitch - not for one minute... Naughty girl... Sailor and Lula are headed west, and guess what? There's no turning back. I'm in a killing mood.
No... I just wanted to kiss you good- bye... You know too much 'bout little Lula's mom...
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
You really are one dumb asshole.
I know... I remember.
I'll tell you the problem. You behind the wheel. There's your fucking problem.
Actually... I just want to go home.
I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in?
Tripp!
I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes to be published. What you do as a writer, what I do as an editor...
He has a book.
Not Curtis.
That was good.
Tripp?!
Sometimes we have to improvise.
James? My James? What's happened?
How bad is it for you?
So tell me about you and the Chancellor.
Who do you think it is?
I want to publish this. I've got to. I think they'll let me. With a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant.
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car.
No...
I've been trying to finish a book...
Better luck next time.
Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?
Sure.
It's just... for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet...
Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James?
Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.
Well...
Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought... I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it. You don't see one of those every day. It looks like heaven...
James.  Don't leave just yet. There's something I think you ought to see.
The one she wore on her wedding day?
They're glass. The buttons.
It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.
You mean, with your wife leaving you and all?  Hannah mentioned something about it. About a note.
I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her husband's dog.
That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.
But... ?
How's that?
It's not so bad. I know the night janitor. And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff.
Isn't this...?
I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me.
Colon cancer.
Outside Scranton.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
You're lying.
And we both thank you for that, but we're... we're... fine.
I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck.
Easy there.
And? Are you going to tell him?
You had another one, didn't you? You have to see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday morning. All right?
Not have it.
Who's gun is that?
I'm kidding. Hello?
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
Sara.
I'm through improvising.
Ouch. How many?
I guess you have to go on faith.
Couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
Grady?
Oh?
Is it good?
Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub all kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb.
Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious... Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.
One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
Are you riding with me, James?
There's so many...
Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth, 1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an accident, but, you know...  He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took pills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more pills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget when. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot himself. Jean Seberg, pills of course, 1979. Everett Sioane -- he was good -- pills. Margaret Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills. Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in 1978. There are more but I don't know if you would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia?
I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?
I'll never forget you got me started there.
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
What's happening?
I've got some pictures.  Want to see?
Soon.
It's not what you think.
There's little chicks!  You want to see?
They're starlings.
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
Something like that.
You should hear the bird.
I think you do.
Cherry?
You walked home.
Do you believe in them?
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
So. How are you adjusting?
And your new apartment?
I'd keep away from him.
No.
What's her name?
Walter?
You seem a little hostile today.
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.
Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
Is that what you are angry about?
I mean, when will I be normal.
You couldn't say.
How do you define it?
You know that if anything happens, I spend the rest of my life in prison. No parole, no nothing.
To relax.
Where?
A nap?
I'm only asking questions.
You felt pleasure.
What?
Want a ride?
I'm talking about you.
You're quiet at work.
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
Something happened to you.
So?
No you're not.
What's the problem?
Do you?
You mean the time you're locked away?
I've changed.
You know, this is crazy.
Being here, with me.
Most people say the odds are against me.
You're scared.
You okay?
I heard they were filthy birds.
This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.
Okay so far.
Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.
What are you still wearing that for?
But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
It was a machine, but it seems almost alive. Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a feeling.
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
Son of a bitch!
We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple.
We'll go in through that large breach.
Did you find Wilhite?
Do we just leave him there?
Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.
Y'all could be more specific.
Quiet!  Quiet!
Are we talkin' little space friend here?
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
You've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig!  With everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here?  Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?
Figured that out for yourself, did you?
Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move...
4800 feet.  It's official.
He's losing it.  Talk to him.  Keep him with us.
No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone.
Which one shall I wear?
Used to what?
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.
Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.
These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all.
It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.
I think you're very sweet, Corrado.
Somebody must live here!
Don't be so humble.
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
Nothing but the usual argument... The only thing was -- if I remember correctly -- that she said she had a need to be alone.
And I suppose it's my fault... Why don't you tell him that too. That's what you believe, isn't it?
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
Oh, Sandro...
Sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.
Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.
Why are you looking at me like that?
No, Sandro... Please...
Good night, my love.
I don't love you.
Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?
He amuses me. I don't know of anything more amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't you find it so, Claudia?
Have you ever been in love?
How do you manage to put up with all this confusion? You always said people bore you.
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
Who are you talking to?
Now what do I have to do to be left in peace?
What happened?
First let the poor thing have something to eat.
Goffredo is the Princess' nephew. He's eighteen years old, the lucky boy. And, what do you know -- he paints.
Because there is no landscape as beautiful as a woman.
Don't worry, we've got everything.
I only exchanged a few casual words with her, as one would ordinarily do on a public bus...
Are you the owner of this place?
Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?
Here I am, Patrizia. I'm always here.
Who knows?... Another one has it that she entered a store in Troina. This information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought I don't know what in his store... at Troina.
I can't say.
Because...
Look at the statues, they're thin.
That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
I don't know.
Should you see a doctor?
Uh huh.
He's told you?
And you like that?
Yes.
Down... there.
I got sicker.
What's your real name?
What else did she tell you?
Sister Paul was in her eighties?  Did she climb up here often?
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
What things?
Do you?
Do you believe she really saw them?
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
And you're unhappy.
What did you do?
Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.
That you're a mistake?
Oh, yes.
Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright?
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
Are you pretty?
Are you intelligent?
Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you.
I really love you.
Did you want it to come out?
No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?
For me to get sick in.
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
Which one?
Are you frightened?
I've been watching. We were fine 'till she came. She brought the devil here.  There was blood on her hand that night.
???
Are you dictating my position to me? We're getting into some sticky legal territories here.
I don't know.
It's Martha, Mama.  There you go.
No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.
But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
Could there have been anyone else?
And you didn't try to find out who?
Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
I believe Agnes is different.
No... not in the eyes of the police.
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
You hate us don't you?
Nuns... you hate nuns.
The Catholic Church...
She is not a child.
Do you know what she did to her?
I haven't decided yet.
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
That's all?  That's enough!  She was a beautiful little girl.
Right.  What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
Do you want to become one?
Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?
Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
You tied the cord around its neck.
The usual ten per cent?
Lay them down.
Oh don't be so stroppy!
Nine.
Eight and two thirds.
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
Well --
You never know, you might be lucky this time.
Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
Ringo!
Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...
Oh, there you are!
Well ... come on.
Should I say it?
Are you supposed to be here?
Are you pulling my leg?
Gear?
They ought to be.
Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever.
Ah.
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
And what's it all come to in the end?
When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.
What are they saying?
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
And we're looking after him, are we?
Yeah ... so what?
Anything to spare?
Eh ... pardon me for asking but who's that little old man?
That little old man.
Well we know that but what's he doing here?
What's old got to do with it?
No.
Paul, John, George - get at it.
Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.
The office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.
Is it?
That's what you tell me.
He belongs to Paul.
How's that?
"The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr. Richard Starkey, that's you, in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet." Blimey!
Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man.
I'll set John on you!
I feel like shit...
Locked.
Engines off.
Are you in pain?
Any rotation?
Dell, I want greater magnification. More surface detail.  I want to see what this place looks like.
Close enough to walk to!
I'm sending.  Do you hear me?
Appears to be a door hanging open, the entrance is clogged with debris.
Are you okay in there?
How do you feel, Dell?
What's wrong?
Breathe deeply.
Hello, Faust!
<u>He</u> died.
We could cut a section out of that metallite netting.  It won't hold up to that acid, but aside from that it's pretty strong.
What happened?  Where's Sandy?
Hurt!  How?
Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are clogged with dust.  We overheated and burned out a whole cell.
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
It's really on there tight.
Might even incinerate the damn thing.
It's clear.
All right... but do <u>not</u> go below decks.
I'll do it.  The rest of you continue.
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
No, don't open the door.  We don't want it escaping.
Yes?
Don't worry, it won't damage it, it'll just give it a little incentive.
While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net.
We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there. 
<u>How</u>?
I've got 'em!  They're back on my screens!
Look at that.
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him?
Don't count on it.
What about all the minerals and elements in the cargo hold?  That's the only reason we came out here. We'd have to abandon them all.  We'd be broke.
Sandy, you want to give us some vision?
It won't come -- it's stuck.
No, thank God... just missed him.
And what do we do when we find it?
This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we are not home.  Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all.
It's out of focus.
Yeah, okay. 
Not a one.  It's dead.
Find anything we missed?
Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
You hear me, Martin?  Open the outer door.
I'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, Martin.  We never should have landed here.
I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
I think the best thing to do with Broussard is to just freeze him as he is.  It'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the Colonies.
Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our food supplies in there!  We can't pump poison gas all over them!
This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing.
So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?
Poor kitty; puss puss puss.
That'll blow the ship up.
Kill me...
That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter...
No... don't...
Minh...
A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.
Seal everything now!
I found it...
It's too late!
Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.
Not yet.
Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
De Vries?
Shit!  Our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores.  We got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it.
Already working on it.
They've changed their heading again.
It's not all good news.  We had to take off the helmet lights.  You'll be going in blind.
See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.
What is that?
Seltzer?
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
Don't worry about it.  If the Network goes by the book, like everyone figures they will, a Marine gunboat from Powell'll drop-by for a look- see in four-or-five days.  They can go poke around out there and find whatever it was hit us.  All we've gotta do is sit tight.
Do you believe him?
Hurry it up.
Jesus.
May I come in?
I expected to find this little room overcrowded, with a theater full of people at your feet...
Of course your performance was no surprise to me. After the other day I regarded it as no more than - a promised fulfilled.
I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly...
I'm about to go into the shower, I won't be able to hear you...
Just like it.
It'll be a night to remember. It'll bring to me everything I've ever wanted. The end of an old road - and the beginning of a new one...
Some plain soda.  Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven...
We're?
Addison, will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly - and then get out so I can take my nap!
What have you got to do with it?
She was a liar, she was a liar!
I don't suppose there's a drink left...
No, it's not.  It's for this.
We never met. That's why.
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
It is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in New York, Hollywood and London are no different from the good people of Des Moines, Chillicothe and Liverpool. By and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children-
Answer me this. What makes a man become a producer?
From the smartness of your dress, I take it your luncheon companion is a lady?
Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support...
Miss Caswell got lucky too late. The audition is over.
Naturally enough, your understudy.
It wasn't reading, it was a performance. Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire...
Macbeth.
Forty-five minutes from now my plane takes off and how do I find you? Not ready yet, looking like a junk yard-
Oh well...  ... look through the wigs, maybe it got caught-
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do-
You in a hurry?
Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it...
Bill... Bill, it's your birthday.
Happy birthday, darling...
Many happy returns of the day...
Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...
Thank you.
Then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say, happier side?
Addison-!
I must have frightened her away.
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
- shows up for an audition when everyone knew I'd be here... and gives a performance! Out of nowhere - gives a performance!
Well, I am.
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
It's not nonsense.
But you may quote me as follows. Quote. Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play, the like of which I have never seen before and expect rarely to see again. Unquote.
There goes Eve. Eve evil, Little Miss Evil. But the evil that men do - how does it go, groom? Something about the good they leave behind - I played it once in rep in Wilkes Barre...
Never try to outguess Margo.
A cowboy.
You said forty-seven minutes. You'll never make it.
Why what?
But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there.
She's on her way. With half the men in the joint.  It's only a fur coat...
There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's-
She, too, is a great admirer of yours.
Who are you?
I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
That's all.
The maid'll fix it in the morning.
How'd you get all the way up here from Brooklyn?
That's the door.
Not at all.
Hello, Miss Channing.
Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
I think she would cheer.
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
Oh, but there is-
You know, I've always considered myself a very clever girl. Smart. Good head on my shoulders, that sort of thing, never the wrong word at the wrong time... but then, I'd never met Addison deWitt.  I remember once I had a tooth pulled. They gave me some anaesthetic - I don't remember the name - and it affected me in a strange way. I heard myself saying things I wasn't even thinking... as if my mind were someplace outside of my body, and couldn't control what I did or said-
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
He can help you.
You want to play "Cora." You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.
Hello, Miss Harrington.
Well... it started with the play before this one...
What - again?
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...
While you're cleaning up, I'll take this to the wardrobe mistress-
Well, I was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night I meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards - and I guess I was asleep when you got home...
If you'd like.
Good evening, Mr. deWitt.
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
"... my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington. I am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops." ... I thought that one went out with Woollcott...  Down here... here, listen to this- "... Miss Harrington had much to tell - and these columns shall report her faithfully - about the lamentable practice in our Theater of permitting, shall we say - mature - actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory-"
Karen, in all the years of our friendship, I have never let you go to the Ladies' Room alone. But now I must. I am busting to know what goes on in that feverish little brain waiting there...
But not right away? First the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella...
Now let's not get into a big hassle-
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.
Eve did mention the play, you know. But just in passing - she's never ask to play a part like "Cora," she'd never have the nerve...
Darling, I didn't promise Eve anything. Just said I thought she'd be fine for the part, but there were some practical difficulties...
Three days, that's for the bourgeois - I see a midnight elopement, waking up a village person...
What's so funny?
I didn't think you would! It seems to me, Karen, that for some tine, now, you've been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general-
Honey chili had a point. You know, I can remember plays about women - even from the South - where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers...
How about calling it a night?
I'm sure.
I never said it was!
It's been quite a night. I understand that your understudy - Miss Harrington - has given her notice.
I don't think I could be.
You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way... and you need her, Max.
This is for lawyers to talk about, this concerns a run-of-the-play contract, and this you can't rewrite or ad lib!
Are you breaking the contract?
I said I'm a dying man!
--Bradlee went to Harvard--
You heard?  They put us both on the break-in thing. Simons liked the way we worked together.  Listen, I'm sorry I said your story was bullshit.
What's that?
---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP--
This is terrific work, if you like rejection.
'68.
--we've got to find out who the five guys are--the five with access to the slush fund--they were aware of the break-in.
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
How do you want to handle Sloan?
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in.
--because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed.
--Jesus--
I know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury. 
What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?
--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.
I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
By "they" you mean the White House, don't you?  Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin-- he works for the White House.
Harry, I just talked to a Miami investigator about Barker--
Speak.
--and we got a guy in Justice--
--it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this--
I thought you had to get to Miami.
If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
Hey, easy...
You were Hugh Sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for Maurice Stans at Finance, and we were sort of wondering, did you go work for Stans immediately after Sloan quit or was there a time lapse?
I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
The ones who could disburse the money.
Why couldn't you have just dialed me from the office, Irwin?
Who by?
Right.
--if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--
Same kind of crap--
Look--why would the Republicans do it? --my God, McGovern is self- destructing before our eyes--just like Muskie did, Humphrey, the bunch of 'em.  Why would the burglars have put the tape around the door instead of up and down unless they wanted to get caught? Why did they take a walkie- talkie and then turn it off, unless they wanted to get caught? Why would they use McCord--the only direct contact to the Republicans?
Anything else from Mr. Throat?
You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken?
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
Yes, sir.
What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
My turn to keep you waiting.  What's the topic for tonight?
You'll have to find that out, won't you.
They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.
Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.
Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?--what were they after?
Talk about Segretti--
There were more then.
And Justice and FBI know all this?
Where?
Where in government?
But it's possible.
As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly.  Except  it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters--  --and  these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying--  --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices.  Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.
OK, get on this W.House guy and do a better job then you did on McCord.
Who's Colson, Harry?
Whaddya got, whaddya got?
So?
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
Howard--
--listen, I love this country, you think I want to bring it down?--I'm not some goddamn zany, I was a hawk--
Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?
--and he says Chapin hired Segretti--
Mr. Sloan?
I can't say anything, I'm sorry. 
You're a killer, Ozzy!
Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
Finch, don't you think it's about time you learned to take a dump at school?
I had no idea you'd be this good!
Of course, Finch.  What?
You're gonna shit your pants!
I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age.  Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison.
Um...Chris --
What's your middle name?
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
You want onions?
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
I know.  Salt and pepper?
...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...
You're missing the game for us?!
What?  We both have cars.
Jessica, can you drive me home?
No comment.
Like a bet?
That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
Did I miss anything?!
But, but -- what would I do?
I know, Dad.
Jim?
Yes.
Son.  This lady's here for you.
Dad.
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
Whatever you want.
So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?
...excuse me?!
This was remade?  Into what?
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
There it is.  I want to grab my bag. Oh, and my date.
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
So you need to change, right?
You are done, James.  Perhaps I should be going now.
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
Tonight?
Like how?
But you don't love me.
Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two of us, we're not your parents.
About the other day...I've been thinking.
That was a great night.
What?
You called me to ask me how to get laid?
Have you ever heard of the bible?
Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that.
Kevin, it was just a --
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!
God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.
You know.  If we hook up, tomorrow I'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.
Hanging is nice. Never goes out of style. What about hare-kare - a taste of the Orient? But no! You're in Paris! Try the Guillotine! There's one in the Louvre!
Merde! Just missed!
Look, the more you think about it, the harder it is.
Salots! Shitfucker!
Andy! Holy shit!
What about your glasses?
Don't you want to change?
This looks familiar...
Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...
I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.
What the fuck!? You too!?
You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
No wonder he let her go.
These tunnels must loop around and connect.
There's something down there! A bear or something! A god damn monster! Beau coup teeth! Huge, Grande, with yellow eyes, all this hair, it killed Serafine! My God...
Pull over! Now!
That's not all...  Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.
I always wanted to do that. I saw it in a movie.
Psychic awareness. Right.
I don't believe we've been introduced.
Oh shit! No! Andy, don't let them take me back there!
Where is it! Please!
Claude.
Jesus...
Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
Merde.
Two more nights in this lunar cycle.
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
Hurry, Grandmama!
I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
Is everyone all right?
No! I look ridiculous!
You'll laugh.
Poor Meetoo!
Why do you want to go to Paris?
Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
Just what do you think you're doing?!
Every Russian family has one..
...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . .  [THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE]
You said you wouldn't laugh!
Don't let me go!
Don't you, child?
What?
What was that?
She doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . .
What do we do now?
May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
Yeah, I do. It's for my girl friend. Make it out to Ralph.
Singer!
Well, you take a meeting with him, I'll take a meeting with you if you'll take a meeting with Freddy.
What do you mean, next?
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
Two minutes, Alvy.
Look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that?
You? You kiddin'?  If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.
Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think-  Aaaah! Okay.
Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
Oh - you're an actress.
Right!  Where?
Oh, you do?
Oh, right.
Huh?
Oh, you see an analyst?
Duane?
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
it's my first time.
Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
Here, you want some?
Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.
Hey?
You see, like you and I...
That's the key question.
I know you've only known me a short while.
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.  M'mrnm.
I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.
M'hm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You've always had hostility toward David ever since I mentioned him!
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
Will it change my life?
Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
I told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. You never know who's gonna crawl over.
Is he in the bathroom?
Okay, let me have this.
Yeah?
Alvy, what about... what if we go away this weekend, and we could-
Happy birthday.
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
Check it out.
That's sick!
...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
Yeah, this place is great.
You look very pretty.
Oh!
Alvy.
Oh, I'm sorry!
Hey, come on, it's quiet now. We can- we can start again.
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
Tsch, a few.
without getting... well, let's put it this way...
Probably on their first date, right?
Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country!
Ah.
Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard.
We do the show live in front of an audience.
Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
Imagine my surprise when I got your call, Max.
But she's colored.
So the colored have enough trouble.
All right-so we can afford it.
Dennis-right, uh, uh... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night.
Oh. What about?
Uh... w-we're going back to the Pierre. We're staying at the Pierre... and we're gonna meet Jack and Angelica, and have a drink there, and... if you'd like to come, uh, we'd love to have you.
Oh.
You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?
Was it a contractor?
You're not upset that I brought the dog?
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
So they tell me.  Not soon enough, of course.  How are you, Sal?  You look fantastic. It changes your life, you know.  A baby. It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it.  Doesn't it, Mac?  You can't be the center of your own world, anymore.
You don't have any clothes on.
What a fucking day!  We only just got a sitter.  I don't know her from fucking Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number.
Oh.
Oh.
Never.
Would you leave us alone right now?
He's gonna miss his flight.
I told his father he'd be on that flight.
Take good care of it.
Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
But she's alright.
I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry.
Time.  Hey!  Time.  Judy!  Time you guys. Hey!!
I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
The Roses?  And of course they said yes.
You're out of your mind.
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
Accept a compliment.
No.  Did you?
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
Okay, knock it off.
Dolphins.  Great.
I think we should all take it tonight. Everyone's staying, stays.  No driving. That's the rule.  I love you Sally-Mae. You're going to have a fabulous time.
Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come!
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
It's a shit novel anyway.
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
I can't got tonight.  I don't want to be on a plane on my own tonight.
That's under lock and key.
Happy anniversary.
Panes!  How are you?
Oh.  Well.  Good.
And I you.
Ah.
Ours.
And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?
I meant Sally.
Sally did all this herself?
I'm a little nervous, so...
The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
And Ryan works at home.
I need to leave you now.
Medallions.
I didn't say a word.
Jesus Christ.
What?
I'm so sorry.
I...
And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality.
Is there space here?
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
She's even better looking in the flesh.
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
Exactly what I mean.  It's all ruined.
How's the movie going?  Your movie.  You are making a movie, aren't you?
Alright.  Well, that's something new.
Um.  Happy for you.
Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much.  We keep him in at night.
I didn't know you had this.
Oh my God, sorry.  I'm interrupting.
I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center.
You don't need to do that.
Enough about me.
It's much more personal in here.
Well, I don't trust her.  I never have.
I trust you.
You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
I don't have a drug problem.
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
Tell me about it.
General -- we have to talk sometime!
He's...he's dead.  You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis.
That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
I order you to find out where we are!
Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
Water...water...
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
Of course --
I felt the same way before I got married.  Confused.  Scared.
Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
Barbatus!
Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.
Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!
Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
Time to cut a rug, Z!
You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
Such a racket I heard in your place -- maybe you had burglars.
Morning, Mr. Baxter.
You should have stayed in bed this morning.
I hope everything goes all right.
I wasn't trying to be personal -- it's just that the fellows in the office were -- whether you wondering about you ever --
Well, it was just an idea -- I hate to see a ticket go to waste --
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order.  Shall we join the natives?
Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
Your phone.
Don't you remember? We were at the office party together --
I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just let me die?
Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first.  Just what are you going to tell her?
And where are you now?
What's her first name?
When are you coming home?
Your stomach?
I didn't mean it that way -- I was just talking to him on the phone -- he's very concerned about you.
There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
Why do people have to love people, anyway?
No doubt about it.
I would.
You turned it on -- but you didn't light it.
What are you doing with that?
Tennis racquet? Oh, I remember -- I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.  I used it to strain the spaghetti. FRAN  Why not?
I know so. He's a taker.
You can't leave yet. The doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.
Worse than that -- she was the wife of my best friend -- and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless -- so I decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five automatic and drove up to Eden Park -- do you know Cincinnati?
Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?
Are we dressing for dinner?
Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night I had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then.  Cheers.
You know what we're going to do after dinner?
You don't have to if you don't want to --
We're going to finish that gin game.
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
Are you all right?
What about Mr. Sheldrake?
Oh, Mr. Baxter -- I'm glad you're here -- I was just going to get the passkey.
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
Baxter?
Been hearing some very nice things about you -- here's a report from Mr. Dobisch -- loyal, cooperative, resourceful --
Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?
You do?
Where is your apartment?
I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
I am?
Morning, gentlemen.  Everything satisfactory? You like your office?
Yes, she's in the shower -- she's coming along fine, considering.
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you --
You're going to take her off my hands?
You left your wife?
Don't mind what?
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
Now hold on, Baxter --
No, no -- just had a little accident.
I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --
A lot of guys around here have tried it -- all kinds of approaches -- no dice.  What is she trying to prove?
So long, Baxter. We know you won't let us down.
Hi, Baxter.
You can't come in.
Say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us?
Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
Make it thirty minutes.  What do you say, Bud?
Teamwork -- that's what counts in an organization like this. All for one and one for all -- know what I mean?
Quite an office -- name on the door -- rug on the floor -- the whole schmear.
There's a girl in my place -- she took some sleeping pills -- you better come quick -- I can't wake her up.
No, thanks -- I don't feel like it. Look, Doc -- in case I don't see you again -- how much do I owe you for taking care of that girl?
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.
You like Castro?  I mean -- how do you feel about Castro? BUD What is Castro?
Family?
Where do we go -- my place or yours?
You got a girl-friend?
Still stuck on her, huh.
What's with you, Fran -- did you forget where you live?
What for?
Well -- thank you.
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
How long has it been -- a month?
It's been hell.
You don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- Good morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still crazy about you, Fran.
I never said goodbye, Fran.
How do you think I felt -- riding home on that seven-fourteen train?
I mean -- about my getting a divorce.
That's enough, Fran.
You're not being funny.
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
Okay.  I just thought as long as it was paid for --
A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
Just walked out on me -- quit -- threw that big fat job right in my face.
That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
Thursday? That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack.
Did you have a nice Christmas?
I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies?
Where are you headed?
Well I mean like they also took our fuel -- We've been here two days.
You're out of your skull --
Who the hell are you?
Thirty -- sometimes fifty.
I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam.
A year ? Waiter another beer.
Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
A sauciere --
There's some bad holes, man, and the cracks -- water's coming through the cracks. Food's shot to hell.
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
Careful,  Captain, they've been known to charge.
Rocks, sand -- those two men who deserted.
I never heard about that.
Our Recon flight ?
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
It's to everyone I really knew -- the first girl I screwed -- my brother -- best friend -- I wanted to tell 'em how much I enjoyed knowing 'em -- it's been a great twenty years. I gotta let 'em know.
It is very good -- there is no current -- It is very good. I have never seen one like it in all Indochina. I was in Paris when it arrived -- do you know what might have caused --
Attacks repulsed, as I was saying.  This is only  for this war, Captain. Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese regular forces -- 15; South Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular forces and otherwise.  Americain -- 6. Of course, they were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.
What's your name, sailor ?
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
You think that section on the point is ridable, Lance?
How big it is?
Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels Four -- bring it in on along tree line and huts.
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
Can you trust them?
That village you're pointing at is kinda hairy.
I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
You know, some day this war's gonna end..
Do you know me?
Did you know him very well?
Captain -- that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff?
What's this tiger shit?
Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out.
I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --
This boat's a mess.
But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.'
Sounds like he's gone crazy.
Right on -- he's been waiting for --
Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?
Are you warm, Captain?
I'm afraid I won't have time -- I gotta --
23   CONTINUED:
See the blood?  Pack of wolves took down a moose.  Greedy, gut-ripping sons of bitches.  I'd kill the last wolf on earth, right in front of the President of the U.S.  Stinking, cowardly predator, the wolf.
117  CONTINUED:  
...I won't let a killer walk!
27   CONTINUED:
A certain sonofabitch bastard -more-
Oh.
Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
What are you doing?
Thanks.
Look, why get into this again. As long as it's working, let's leave it alone.  It's been nice so far.  We're together --
Maybe you should drive him into Devil's Cauldron, let them decide what to do with him.
Please, Anne Marie, you being here only complicates things.
Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.
When you ran off, I thought you'd keep going 'til you were back home in Washington.
Ben Corbett?
Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.
Does he have people?
How the hell were they smart enough to find us?
Been driving long?
Ice is too thin -- you can see the water moving underneath.
Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head.  You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?
There's a cabin, maybe twenty miles south of here.
Told you I'm fine!
Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
It was blown up with the plane.
Don't judge me.  You're a joke, coming here from a fucked-up culture, telling us what to do!
Emergency transmitter?  What happened to signal mirrors or two-tone smoke fires?
Answer and I'll shoot!
Can you walk?
Christ if I shouldn't know better than to step in soft earth.  I've seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years old.
Sam, listen -- I shot to defend my man.  Other guy drew first.
What's wrong?
You can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline.  The few voters there are in this district look up to Corbett, and I'm not about to alienate them.
Nobody wants any more killings; we all agree to that, correct?  That's good.  Now, Eric, you're gonna hand your prisoner over to us.
I'm too old for this shit.
He saw you and Corbett come in...
I called the cops in Fairbanks, see when Ben is standing trial. They don't know shit about Ben or Wilder!
Look, we pull Ben's ass out of the fire, I'll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars.
It's Sam Wilder!
There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact.
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
He's good...  And I'm an expert on doctors.
What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend...  now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, "Thank you." No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe.
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
Sorry.
I'm hungry.  You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten.
What needs clearing up?
So you'll be at work?
Getting loud, getting loud.
So. Anything else?
My son.
Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
Hi.
I was going to do that for you.
Thanks, Melvin.
... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano.
My son was outside playing soccer. I never saw him playing ball. Come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time... Take me out dancing.
Stop asking everyone.
Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
I don't want to hear that music right now.
I'll take you... why not?
Do you want to know what happened with my parents?
I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
I love you...  Let him take you home.
What the heck do you mean?
So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
Yes, we do... And I can give you a tie and jacket.
Sorry. What are those cards?
Absolutely.
Oh, is he dead?
Which color was that?
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like...
Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?  By the way, thanks for saving me.
Would you leave now, please?
I think you gotta camp it here...
What did she say?
Because...  ... you love her?
Picking on me won't help.
What's wrong?
I can't resist. You usually move through here so quickly and I have so many questions I want to ask you. You have no idea what your work means to me.
Not too good at small talk, eh?
No shit.
Probably.
Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on.
Boy, that's fucking genius.  You're a fucking genius.  Then you're just sitting there, bullshitting with me. Man, no way I coulda done that!
Bain.  Michael Bain.
You don't have to tell me that. It's just, I know my bid was low, but was it too low?  I mean, did I seem like an amateur, like I didn't know what I was doing?
Okay.
Listen to me, Bain.  Two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where I was going to pick up the transferred money from MicroCell. You don't know how they got the information.  It bothered you, but you didn't care.  How do I know this?  Because ten years ago, I was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now.
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
Such language in front of a lady.
No, the other Hotel Paraiso, in the city.  Near the Plaza del Sol.
What?
Who is the mark?
I have been sitting on a contract from Cleveland for six days because of you.
Nikita?  She helped me find you.
I work for the government.
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
Why?
Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --
Why?
How?
Yeah.
I killed him.
Some people said that.  I never thought so.
I was just different.
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
My first take?
Do you have a passport?
But you've never figured out a way to win.
In Costa Blanca.
I know what you are thinking.  I'm not going to disappear, okay?  I'm not going anywhere, just down there, to that beautiful beach.  I got to get out of this room, just for a little while.
You should knock.
Where did you learn it?
Two way?
He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
Then, we wait.
I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
Yes.
What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?
I don't believe that.
You didn't take it.
Ten years later, here you are again.
Nobody ever sees me.
Uh-huh.
I'm taking off my mike.
I thought it was interesting --
I prefer it like this.
You're very good at this aren't you?
Do you ever regret things you've done?
Then, I'll sail alone.
You're pretty famous aren't you?
Right.
Can I ask you a question?
Look at that.  I haven't watched the sun set in a million years. Do you mind?
Of course, senor.
Because it's in English?
Inspirations a fickle thing, you don't realise you had it till it's gone.
It all comes down to ideology and they've lost theirs. If I'd been here ten years ago, maybe they wouldn't be in the mess they are today.
I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
What we need is a space for real performance art. A cultural exchange for radical expressionism.
He's not drunk, he's crazy.
Like Custer huh?
Okay, we're listening. But I'm with Katka on this one.
No, but like my dad said, "There's only so many ways you can wire a plug".
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much.
I'm making history Chris, nothings going to stop me. There could be a knighthood for us in this, once President Havel hears.
Tell them we're working for the University.
No, why?
It must be on the other side of this.
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
Destroy the evidence huh.
No, not if you've got better things to do.
What happened to Katka?
Shit no, it'll be twice cost.
Does Jahn's thing have a name?
It's me you want, I'm responsible for all this.
They're good guys..... Have you seen Holly?
Damn!
I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.
It's...42 56 76 .
If I cut a deal, I'm not staying in this country and I want Holly to come with me. So, if she doesn't come here today, you're going to have to get her to me tomorrow; after I call, promise?
Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?
Yeah, no problem.
I don't know what it is with you bloody hooligans. Not content with causing trouble back home, YOU idiots have to go off and wreak havoc throughout the whole of Europe. And when finally, the police do catch up with you, you expect us to wave a magic wand and get you out, well not this time, I'm sorry.
I could pencil you in if you like?
Turned Czech huh?
Well, get me and Chris a drink then.
A word of advice my celibate friend. These Czech girls look like dynamite and go like it, but don't be fooled; there's a price to be paid and it's going up fast. Right Kat?
Doug I can't, I've got to be at work by eight. You promised to take me home.
I'll do my best. Is the place open.
About forty minutes.
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!
And take Jiri with you?
What would you like, beer?
Why don't we both forget about him?
Where did you steal the car?
We'll have to see what more we can do for you, while you are still our guest.
Good try Mr. Greenwell but a little late. We have analyzed the contents of that drum, the remains of the disks are there, just as you said.
I'm not sure it's possible.
I'll need to make a phone call.
No, just a drill.
Nothing. I've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. You've got one haven't you?
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
Great, let's break for lunch and I'll buy you a beer on the way.
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
Shall I look after the rest?
Honey what a pleasant surprise, sorry to keep you waiting.
What are you an idiot!
It was crazy not to have destroyed them
What if his accomplices have made copies?
Delay Mr Greenwell's departure until the disks have been located and you have notified me. Then, have one of your officers drive him home - I'll see to the rest.
So go dance.
It could help with a new car --
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
Where is he? He's supposed to be here.
'Is it really me?'
That's deep --
Saturn. Beautiful.
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
No.
You're not in a very good mood.
The play's in a couple of weeks.
Oh. Just not at school...
So it's like you want to be secret friends.
I haven't been nice to you.
I don't want to be just your friend --
It's a start.
Yes. But not as a date date.
Your turn.
It's places like this that make me certain there's a God.
We can measure wind.
What's wr--?
Can you locate XXI5639I?
Here. Why am I looking at this star?
I'm so sorry. I'm a coward --
Help me live until I die?
What are you thinking?
Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie needs. I'm here.  I could start by driving her to school --
I'm supposed to always be alone?
I'm sorry your mother isn't here to help you become a woman.
Did you give him a gift?
You're in the play?
Reverend Sullivan. Can I ask you something?
I care for her.
So talk to us about something.
Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays.
Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.
I don't get it. How come there's no rock 'n roll?
And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
I've been calling you for five minutes! Didn't you hear me?
You mean you're going to stay up all night?
How old are you?
It's polyester.
Huh?
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!
By the way, that reminds me...  Saturday night we're taking Grandma Stella out for Chinese food.
Dad, you seen the drill?
No, Chinese food is fine.
Your line, George!
What?!
Catch you later! 
But Professor --
The plutonium! That's what I came over here for! Professor, where did you get that stuff?
You've convinced me that you must be who you say you are. No living human has ever seen this machine.  But why? Why even in my twilight years would I remotely consider sending someone back in time?
On second thought, there may be some things you'll have to tell me.
How did you know?
Then I would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history! Don't you understand? The fabric of history is very delicate. Anything you do could have serious consequences!
An atomic bomb.
Your 'mother' wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon, and that if you were interested in going to the dance Saturday, she's available.
Hop in, Marty, . We've got a long drive ahead of us.
Sweet and what?  Maybe you'd better pay for this first.
Suzy!
What you been doing?
Yeah, I guess.
What'd they look like?
What do you feed him?
You ever held another job before?
You lost that one?
Then why'd you do it?
Good luck to you.
What do you think you're doing? Go on, get out of here.
What for?
Jack.
I've got to stick by Kit... He feels trapped.
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
You still in school?
That's my father. I got to run.
Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.
Hi.
Quit my job.
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
I came in the front.
Why?
"The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."
Think I got 'em?
Don't.
Why not? I mean, I'm having fun... At least I'm not bitching.
Boy. I had a feeling today was going to be the day... Helicopter.
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
Who are you?
Okay, friend. Start running.
Hi.
She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--?
Not me. No way.
Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...
I'm starving...somebody, help.
Then what?
Apache?
We will, old fried, we will.
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?
...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for...
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.
Got a casualty list?
He offered you money?
The girl I remind you of.
Another 'you'?
Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.
Never.
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight?
Is, uh... Is he okay?
Let him go.
...Hello.
No, I  I didn't mean to sound 
Well that's what he said.
Sir, I'm flattered that you even recognize my name. My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood.
Don't worry about it. It's just a B picture. I bring it in on budget, they'll book it without even screening it. Life is too short.
Sure he did. And he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa.
Wuddya got for me  what the hell happened to your face?
What do you think this is? HAMLET? GONE WITH THE WIND? RUGGLES OF RED GAP? It's a goddamn B picture! Big men in tights! You know the drill!
A souse!
I thought you were going to join us. Jesus, Garland, you left me alone with those people.
...Look, they love you, kid  everybody does. You see Caven's review in the Herald?
What do you mean, Barton?
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?
What kind of scribbler are you  newspaperman did you say?
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying  a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
...And look, I'm sorry as hell about the interruption. Too much revelry late at night, you forget there are other people in the world.
Howdy, neighbor.
Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here.  Figured I'd drop by.
...This must be boring you.
...Probably sounds a little grand coming from someone who's writing a wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.
I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie. I'll miss you.
...I guess it seems pathetic to a guy like you.
...Can I come in?
What do you think happened?
Jesus... You're leaving.
...Yes, thank you.
Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider 
Fink.
Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards.  They'd love to see me sit this one out.
...Okay
Okey-dokey, go ahead.
Jesus! Ain't that a load off! You live in 605?
Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
Good luck with no fuckin' head.
Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.
Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers.
Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say anything you might remember could be helpful. But I'll be frank with you: That is not helpful.
...I thought you said you were a writer.
Okay.  I went after him.  I lost my temper.
Yeah, I was drinking.
No?
You okay?
What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you?
I had him in two classes.
What's your new book about?
If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring at all.
What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?
Jack Daniel's okay?  It's gonna have to be.
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
Say -- "What do you want from me, Catherine?"
Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
How's your new book?
Are you kidding?  You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
How'd you get in here?
I'm writing a book.
I hate rugrats.
There is no smoking in this building, Ms. Tramell.
Did you ever tie him up?
It teaches you to lie.
No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.
He had a girlfriend?
Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?
You think I --
I don't understand what the hell's going on here, pop.
If she's telling  you the truth.
Were you with him last night?
You sure?
Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
Gus -- go over to Berkeley. Harrigan -- find out what else she's published.  Andrews -- get the files on her parents' accident. Carbon Beth on everything.  I want some psychological input on this Andrews and Harrigan go; Nick is left there with Gus.
You knew her, didn't you?
She's got enough money to burn this whole department down.
How old was she when this happened?
Yes I did.
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
Of what?
New York.
Yeah... Like  stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
Well, I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card.
Jean, your parents are here.
Who did this?  Who did this?
MOTHAFUCKAH!
B.B. It's me  Jean! What's the matter? No snow in Switzerland this year?
What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
What are they?
You're shattering all my myths.
Your people.
I don't go there. Too many party girls.
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
... What's the matter?
You're back.
I'm your family.
Which island of Hawaii do you want our house to be on? Maui? Kaui? Molokai?
It looks done.
... babies.
Hi.
So. Are you ready? I start Columbia next fall. Of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but  whatever. I'm really excited.  And: Rene gave me a job as his secretary. His poems are getting published.
That is amazing. What year is it?
I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
Forget it .I'll take six, no, seven chocolate shakes, an order of fries, a Big Mac, and two apple pies.
I'll take the whole tin.
You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.
Hi.
Some of them.
See you later.
How can I ever thank you?
You're a fast mover.
What? Wait a minute... talk to me.
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it  did your girlfriend leave you?
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too.
It's cold.
Sorry, Alfred, I have to get to the Plaza.  You heard Penguin, he was practically begging me to show.
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
Ah.  "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?
How could you?  I'm a woman...
I can't sleep either, lately.  A little link, between us.  But bottom line baby, you live to preserve the peace, and I'm dying to disturb it.  That could put a strain on our relationship.
You're the second man who killed me this week.  But hey, no prob ... I've got seven lives left.
What're you really after?
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.
Not compared to that "Cobblepot" person you're promoting...
"Oswald" is linked to the Red Triangle Gang.  I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
Selina!  Selina Kyle!?  You're fired!  And Bruce -- Bruce Wayne! Why are you dressed up as Batman?
Y'mean frame him?
Son!
I ... it was terrible, I leaned over, and accidentally knocked her, out --
Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.
It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
Find my brother Wilfred.  Give him This.  I have duties he must fulfill in my stead.  Only family can be trusted.
You have?
Well, I hope you'll stay with us.
Alfred, old friend, I could use your help right now.
Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions.  Fear.  Rage...
I could have made it, you know.  I didn't need your help.
I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand.
... A giant drilling truck burrowing under the city ...
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
You think Freeze will take the bait?
I'm totally over her.  Positively.
Umm-hmmmm.
Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
Tell me, billionaire, would you warm faster to my pleas if I looked more like Ms. January here?
Dr. Isley.  it was like I could feel you in the room.  You're...enchanting. Gorgeous.  The most beautiful woman I've ever seen.  If you're..um... free...this evening.
That's gotta hurt.
Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
Of course.  Alfred still keeps your mother's picture in his room.
Hail the all-knowing Bruce Wayne. Here's what I know, she loves me, Not you and it's driving you crazy. It's why you stopped us from kissing. Because if you can't have her, nobody can.
That's no batlight, it's a birdcall.
You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
Impressive
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
My reserves are exhausted.  I must have the gems that power my suit.
In my weakened state I am no match for the bat and the bird.
Trust me.  Vegetable magnetism.
Make yourself right at home.
I have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals.  Once you have frozen mankind, my mutants will overrun the globe.  The Earth will become a brave new world of only plants. And we shall rule them.  For we will be the only two people left in the world.
You will distract the bat and bird while I prepare to freeze Gotham.
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
Do you remember the night I fell into that cave and the bat chased me?
All the answers are numbers.
And another name for Mystery?
What now sir?
Up here, Al.
...dual personalities. Abnormal psychology. Washington's poster child for the criminally insane. I read your work.
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
We'll talk some other -
My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko.
I think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats?
I'm surprised you aren't blind by now.
That kid is amazing.
Look, I'm rock climbing Sunday. How about coming along?
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
What the hell did you think you were doing?
We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
Exactly. And once you'd killed him you'd be lost. Like me.  All this has to be a choice. Otherwise...it's a curse.
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
Who is The Batman, Edward?
That floor has got to be very hard. Is that better?
How high up would you say that is?
It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control.
GET IN THE CAR!!
They don't come down here. They're afraid of the lights.
Do you want a drink?
All street mimes should be executed.
Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.
We'll raid the Ace the moment we get a warrant.
It's me.  "Sugar Bumps."
And what happens if we say no?
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist.  People might like to see the face behind the makeup.
I'll see you burn.  I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.
Where does one man get all this junk?
Rich.  Reclusive.  Bankrolls half a dozen charities.
Nice snap, huh?  Pulitzer Prize, 1963.
Yep.  He watched the whole thing happen - - Recognize the beat cop?  Jim Gordon
You are on drugs.
Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope.  CRAZY BAT-STARD!
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
Go ahead.
Liar.
Yes.  And	I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Here, let me do that.
Two dollars please.
Goodnight Annie.
Oh Jesus.  Oh God.  Oh Jesus God.  Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.
What happened?!!!
Howls he getting on with the family?
Okay, that'll do.  The Governor's here in half an hour.  We have to be totally ready then.  No excuses.  Period!
Ah, David.  Finally.  And this must be our professor from across the sea.
Ah... He certainly has something, sir.
David, David, David ...
Shut up, Kevin.
You know, Mr. Bean's okay.  You're not gonna kick him out, are you, Dad?
Dammit, Beavis, I was about to score. Huh huh.
We're gonna get paid to score.
Dammit! Huh huh. That chick wants me.
Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
Me first.
Check it out Butt-Head, TV!
Huh huh huh. Hey Beavis. We're on a bus with chicks.
Heh heh. Fire. Heh heh Aaaaeeehhhhg!!!
Oh yeah. Can you just take us to Washington? We're gonna meet her there and, you know, heh heh hmmm...
Really? I poop too much.
They perk me right up.
Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the plane!
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
Okay, boys and girls, our suspects are on a tour bus we believe to be headed for...  the White House! Jumpin' Jesus! I want everyone there. Our people. Locals. Orders are shoot to kill. Repeat! Shoot to kill!
Do her? Huh huh.
This is Travis and Bob... What's your last name, dear?
Whoa, this kicks ass! Huh huh huh.
Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?
You scored with two chicks?!
You got two seconds!
Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?
You'll be rich!
Get <u>away</u> you little monster.
I don't think we survived the crash.
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
She can't see you, right?  In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.
What about this Beetle guy?
... Not what I expected when we walked through that door.
I feel really stupid.
Go ahead... third time's a charm.
Has anything been simple so far? From the look of the shovel, we dig.
Honey.  Let's go.
But <u>we</u> let him out.
Maybe they'll leave now.  That snake was a pretty nasty customer.
You know, I've been thinking.  I could teach Lydia to sew.
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
We've been given a gift here, honey.  A real live little girl. She likes us a lot.  She needs us. Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to <u>things</u>.  The house, antiques, your model.  Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone.
What...?
What time is it?
We weren't there.  The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.
What is going on?
You don't have an appointment, do you?
<u>Barbara</u>?!!
You lilly-livered bleeding hearts!
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
We're very unhappy.
Tell the truth.
Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
W... What is it?
Your qu...?  But you're...
I was just trying to open the door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key.
Look at all that <u>parking</u>!
Are they suffering?
<u>You jerks</u>!  That is my art, and it is <u>dangerous</u>!  You think I want to die like that?  Lydia.  Moving is a family affair. So buckle down now and go get Mommy some drugs.
Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors.  You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.
Is the rest of the house as bad as this?
What's wrong?
Blue-green!  Hydrated chromic oxide!  Remember I'm schooled in chemistry.  I was a hair analyst! Briefly.  Interior design is a <u>science</u>, Delia!  Think of me as Doctor Otho.  And this patient is truly <u>sick</u>!
Are they still here, Otho?
Well there's a Little Deetz at least.  Boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, don't you?
Hellooo!  How's school?
The injection will ease the pain and swelling, Mr. Gardiner.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.
I would like to walk today.
Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.  ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.
... Eve - this has been an exhausting day for Ben...
I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.
Do you know Raphael?
Oh. I have a message for him.
Oh, Mr. Gardiner, I've been looking all over.
Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.
Yes... I know, Chauncey.
Oh, I like that very much.
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
... I'm grateful to you, Chauncey... I would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that...  ... But you're so strong - I can trust myself with you. I'm glad, Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed so much restraint...
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!
Yes, Eve. That would be good.
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.
Failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells... Not a damn thing they can do about it. Oh, they can make me comfortable, prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions... And what makes my blood boil, what little I have left, that is, Mr. Gardiner - is that it's generally a young person's disease... Here I am, getting on in years and about to die of a young person's disease...
... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology.
Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.
Bravo!
It's a very pleasant room, Ben.
No, Ben.
Yes, when I was younger I had thoughts about public office... But I found, Chauncey - that I was able to contribute more as a private citizen... of course, my wealth provided me with considerable influence, but I've tried, believe me, not to misuse that power... It's extremely important, Chauncey, when one is in a position of eminence, that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country... The temptations are strong, and I've been labeled a 'kingmaker' by many, but I have tried to stay open to voices of the people... I have tried to remain honest to myself...
I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.
... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
Certainly, Ben.
Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
We could do it now, we can go upstairs.  ... Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
It's starting to swell, is it painful?
Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening.
... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
Since you were a child?
How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.
... Gardiner is laconic, matter-of fact. The scuttlebutt is that he's a strong candidate for one of the vacant seats on the board of First American. But before we can do any sort of a piece on the man, we're going to need facts on his background...  ... Kinney, what did you come up with?
... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
... Ben, really...
Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
... This is another world, Tom - I never would have believed it...
... Yeah...
Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.
This is not what I requested.
So...? Where the hell is it?
What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
Mr. President, I'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
... Well?
Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
You take care too, Bobby.
I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
Say, aren't you that actor guy?
Malkovich.
I never played a jewel thief.
When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job.
Why'd you do it, Craig?
Now?
How was it?
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
You were him last night, weren't you?
Don't forget me.
I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
Tell her you need to see her.
You fell in love with her first.
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
People make mistakes.
Holy shit, yes!
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Mr. Juarez?
Yex?
Security.
Dr. Lester...
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
Somebody told you.
No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see...
Don't you want to know what happened to me?
You wanted to be partners with me?
Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
You're late.
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this.
Yes, my dear?
Oh, be still my heart.
I'm getting divorced.
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
Aaaahhhh, the portal!
Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
Yeah, I saw them
She's not available.
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
Thanks so much for coming over.
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
I'm getting better all the time.
I'd love to see your work.
No one would ever have to know its not him.
Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
You still know.
..I swallowed her blood right along with my mother's milk. She played with me and always came to be with me whenever I needed her. Me and her waited for our daddy. I love her. I do. She never hurt me. I love my mother but I know she killed one of her own, and tender as she is with me, I'm scared of her because of it. All the time, I'm afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own, could happen again. Whatever it is, it comes from outside this house, outside the yard. So I never leave this house and I watch over the yard so it can't happen again ... I have to keep it away from my sister...I'll protect Beloved...'Cause She's mine...
Well, is it now? How you getting along?
You on your way home?
Your mother all right?
You think she sure 'nough your sister?
They good whitefolks?
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
You know he's colored? What else there to know?
It's her, ain't it?
Sethe. He took up with her and stayed in there and you don't want nothing to-
Well, who can tell what went on in there? I never even knew who Sethe was or none of her people.
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our price in the future? How are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are they gonna pay for us, if we free?
You don't know what I think.
She comes in the daytime.  She still with me, my Denver.
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works over by the slaughterhouse. Said she lived on Plank Road.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
Manolo will load it into your car for you, uh, Dude.
I know my rights.
The Gundersons.
Excuse me?
They range up to three thousand.
What the fuck is he talking about?
What do you mean, Dude?
I was bowling--
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
Burkhalter.
Are you gonna split hairs?
That's the key to the city of Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was given two years ago in recognition of his various civic, uh.
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
These are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak--
No, they--
Heh-heh--
1972 Pontiac LeBaron.
No.  Here.
Ahh, not so good, man.
Take it easy, Dude.
Me?  How would I know?  The only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me.
Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?
Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
I was talking about my rug.
Shit yeah, the achievers.
Yeah, but my-
Well...yeah--
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money.  Father doesn't have any.
Increases?
Yeah, but--
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, Dude.
The fucking point is--
We?  What the fuck we?  You said you just wanted to come along--
FUCK.
There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!
Wooden bridge, huh?
Aitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used to say.
Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about that poor woman?  What do we tell--
You don't know, Walter?  You seem to know the answer to everything else!
That wasn't her toe.
Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off.
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?
Is this your homework, Larry?
You're going to enter a world of pain, son.  We know that this is your homework.  We know you stole a car--
It is a fucking emergency.
I mean we totally fucked it up, man. We fucked up his pay-off.  And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything.  Huh?
I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man!  He's had enough!  He no longer digs her!  It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks?  I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.
His million bucks was never in it, man!  There was no money in that briefcase!  He was hoping they'd kill her!  You throw out a ringer for a ringer!
Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle.
Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.
What about that shit about Vietnam!
Another Caucasian, Gary.
Well sir, it's this rug I have, really tied the room together-
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man.  I mean, if your wife owes--
Ah fuck it.
Mind if I smoke a jay?
'Scuse me?
Brandt, give him the envelope.
Shit, sorry man.
Smokey Huh?
You've been training two years to take me out.  Here I am, the big, bad vampire hunter.  So do it.
What about Nomak?
how long since he was bitten?
Thank you.
How does it look?
I agree.  We play along for now, we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks.
What do you think?
He's right.  They'll smell that you're human.  Stay here, watch our backs.
You ask me, you and Miss Muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste.
I did some checking on that Carter Stevens character.  That familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the NIH? Turns out he used to work for them, but he doesn't anymore.
Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!
You want me to hunt them for you.
The genetic material you spliced into Nomak --  Where did you get it?
And why is that?
Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
What's going on?
Oh yeah?  Like how little?  In case you hadn't noticed, we lost two men while you were out farting around.
I would hate to think you were losing your perspective.  Who do you think God favors in the web?  The spider or the fly?
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
What took you so long?
Whistler, I --
Beautiful day, isn't it?
The Day Walker's blood is a disparador -- a trigger, you see? For LaMagra's return. One need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him.  "And the Sleeper will rise from the shadows anew, cleansing the world in a Tide of Blood."
But he's a policeman --
What are you looking at?
Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them.  See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman.
It's dark in here.
I can't -- I won't be able to stop --
How's it going, Kam?
You don't have to be.
I wish you could see the world as I do. Deacon opened my eyes. There's no turning back from that.
-- but then I remember what an ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back to reality.
The Day Walker represents a unique opportunity. We'd be fools to waste it by killing him.
I see. And what would you have us do with this "half-breed"?
What happens then?
What -- ?
Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
Whistler!
And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?
All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood?
Basically you'd have to re-write the victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin.
On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure --  The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him.
What do you mean?
--stop it! Stop talking about it! I'm gonna freak!
Why?
Looks like business is booming.
So says her website.
--chalked just hours ago by ancient adolescents. It's called vandalism.
Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
What?
Was that you laughing?
Just...try and go back to sleep.
The clothes--take 'em off-- I want to see every square inch--
Oh, Jesus, no--
It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!
--last thing I remember were those four clowns shooting the movie--
Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.
This is a little nuts.
Okay, a blur.
You're a complete fucking idiot, aren't you?
I take it back--she <u>wasn't</u> an actor. She's a nutjob.
Get <u>out</u> of here!
English.
You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
Where?
We're not making Blair Witch II here.
Cotter?
Either way, maybe there's a book in it, and they both make a ton of money.
Okay, but--
<u>What</u>?
Let's get inside.
Running a junk yard.
There's four other angles, man, we haven't even--
Well, she's got to be <u>somewhere</u> here.
Chrissake: why <u>any</u> of this?
Just let it go, I've got you!
Oooh. Oooh.
What'd you see?
Jesus.
I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.
--I know!
I can't do it!
No. We <u>all</u> go.
Like a blueprint for disembowelment.
You're gonna keep an eye on Marty and Ray, make sure nothing happens.
...For you I answer the door. If you wanna stay here, that's fine. But I'm retired.
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
Who was it?
...I can find a place tomorrow, then I'll be outta your hair.
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
Hello?
...Ray?
Well... what happened?
...Who?
...So?
You won't have to. I'll explain what a palate is.
He needs a room, Dusty.
What night is it?
...I don't know. Sometimes I think there's something wrong with him. Like maybe he's sick? Mentally?... Or is it maybe me, do you think?
...What're you gonna do in Houston?
...You get a refund though, if you tell me who else she's been sluicing.
Well what?
...There's a big--
Yeah...
Just the ten thousand'll be fine.
...it's too damn risky.
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
Red Label.
Deuce in the corner needs help.
Tuesday is ladies' night.
Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick. What's going on?
See you Tuesday, Frank.
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
Anything you can tell me?
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Not yet.
Where are we going, Frank?
Frank?
Look at these. What are these?
Yes? What is it?
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Shit. You better tell me something.
I made it go down the toilet.
I liked being with you last night.
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. if you need to. come to where I live. O.K.?
I want you to hurt me.
Come on Dorothy.
Do you love me?
You called me Jeffrey.
Shh. I'll tell you.
Who, Dorothy?
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
What are you lookin' at?
What do you know about the ear?. anything?
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?
I'd like to talk to you about something.
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
Are you alright?
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
I owe you. since I goofed up this one.
I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
Brilliant.
Okay. yeah, call.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Okay. thanks.
Wow. Should you tell my father?
Can I give you a kiss good night?
You want to dance?
NO.
You want to dance?
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
Yeah?
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
Would you like a piece of cake?
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Sandy? ...Sandy, please.
Come on out a minute, okay?
QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?
On the plane.
Norman Cay is not a person.  He is an island, George.  In the Bahamas.  From what they say, it is free and it's Diego's new home.
The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.
Surprise.
Not so fast.  I would like to go over the details.
Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
What the fuck is that?
What the fuck is that?
I don't know...
What did I tell you?
Half a million for you.  Half a million for me.  One-point-three five for the Colombians.
It's nothing personal, George.  Just business.
Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited me.
You?
What's that?
Oh, come on, George.  If we are to be friends, we must trust each other.
Twenty-six months.
But you must.  It's the only way.
Good to see you, Diego.
A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
This is only part of the business, George.  A very small part.  Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you.  I must go to Colombia.
Touche.
Pablo used his influence.  Now, George, watch what you say.  Everybody hears everything.  A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America.  Life is cheap here, you know?  No offense, but you know what I'm saying?
Three million.  I counted it twice.
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me.
Take it easy!  Everything's okay!
George, I am happy to see you.  How are you, my brother?
You'd better kill me now, Diego, because you're a dead man.
Cocaine?  How much?
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell him he's not welcome here.
I'm sorry, George.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
Give this to Mom, will you?
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
Look what the cat dragged in.
Do I know you?
Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.
What?
Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to school.
He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.
I don't know.
Let me ask you something.  If you could go anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go?
California?  You can go anywhere in the world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia. Paris.  And you choose California?
California, huh?
There's schools in California.
Because she's visiting me.
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
Stoned?
Smith.  Hampshire....
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand.  It's all there.  Wow.  A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.
What's the matter, George?  Something wrong?  You look like you just fucked your mother.
Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?
Second name.
Which "district" do you belong to?
Second district ... Explain better ...
Can you read?
All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
And so the tapeworm no longer has a head. Are you satisfied, Mathieu? In Algiers everything should be over.
What is she saying?
Okay. But we want your promise for a fair trial in writing. Give us a written statement, Mathieu, and then we'll surrender.
Take some time off.
I think I'm going to make your day.
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?
Objection, Your Honor.
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
I'll tell her but she won't take it.
I've got work to do.
Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness.
Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?
She was here?
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh to your office?
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
Why did she say she was leaving?
Why do you think she left you?
If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
Yes.
What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
What kind of information?
Dr. Paley, where were you the last time you saw Miss Lawson?
Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps?
What did you prescribe for her?
I heard him say it.
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
-- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him?
How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?
Who told you that?
Yes.
I've tried it.
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money.  That must have made you pretty angry?
Yes.
As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?
How?
Hi, Frank.
Sorry.
I'm sure you'll be able to handle him.
You killed him -- didn't you?
You killed him.  You killed him -- and I got you off.
I've been thinking about that.  I've decided to give it to you after I've collected the inheritance.  You can take that one if you want -- but there's another copy.
I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch.  Do you?
But Your Honor--
Really.
Can't it wait?
How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults?
Why don't you talk to him now?
What's wrong?
Please -- not now.
Don't use language like that at the dinner table.
I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
It's a beautiful picture of her.
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
What?
Grateful!?
What are you doing?
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
Not yet. You want to go?
My niece had "the changes" when she was thirty-one.
Well, nobody put a gun to his head.
Are you supposed to be in Iowa?
So, how long you've been living here?
This won't take long. I'm shooting tomorrow morning. I just need to do some prep work.
This time of year.
Well, thank you for all your help, Mrs. Johnson.
Where are you staying while you're here?
What?
Then what happened?
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
Why doesn't it scare you?
Listen, I'm sorry I --
I would love to come for dinner.
I'll pick you up.
Oh.
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
Take me somewhere.
Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
What were you like when you were younger?
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
Where was she?
I was honest with you. I told you who I was.
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?
What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
What about your husband?
"I had forgotten this. I had somehow remembered it being more his fault, his decision. Then I remembered we made love in that field before we left for home. And I remembered it was my idea. I remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he would kidnap me. I had forgotten that too. And I wondered, as I sat there... how many other things I'd forgotten."
I'm positive.
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.
Well, she's... she's real pretty and ... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport, ya know, for laughs and  ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer.
Oh my God...!
About an hour ago.
'S up?
Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.
Shit.
Where's the gangsta of love?
You ain't going down there.  Not alone. I'll go.
Clean your mouth, or I will.  Those boys had no business messing down there.  Go places you're not meant to be -- that's what you get.
Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
You tell my old friend Mackie, I'll be seeing him.  Soon.  Real soon.
Let me see your hand.
Aren't you going to join us?
You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.
You got his hands.  Beautiful hands.  I didn't even know.  That night.  When they - we - killed him, that you were already alive inside me.  Life's like that. Grows right out of death.
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
We'll have to sneak in.
Lucky thing.
No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
I'm here.
Patrick, he's...
Don't worry.  It's just round the corner. Halfway down that block, you can't miss it.  Top step of the front stairs, there's a loose stone.  Go on, I ain't shitting you.
Did you do it?
Why?  Why did you give a shit about the building?  Why did you care that we were there of all places?
I been watching you.  You done good. Invested wisely.  Respectable businessman now.  Just like you always wanted.
Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
Nice rack.  How old is --
And damp, too.  Let's not forget damp.
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
Illibent?  Who's club is that?
Come on, Pop, all I want to know is one thing.  Just one thing after he made such a big deal out of it.  I bet it wasn't a big deal.  Was it, Caesar?
You don't think I'll do it, do you?
The money!
So, you just got out?
Caesar, what happened?
They were early.
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
Stupid cunt!
Shut up, Violet.
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
We were in a car accident --
I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.
You know he would have done you, too.
You planned this whole thing, didn't you?
You're helping Rajeev?
What?  How about a drink?
Yeah?
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
Okay, sure, Mick.
No, Cease.  There was no answer.
That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax.
I started thinking maybe it's about the money so I call you, but all I get is the busy signal.  I figure the phone is off the hook, that's why I come rushing over here.
Actually, yeah, she was nervous about Gino coming, wanted everything to look right.  You know women, Mick.
Un-fucking-believable.  I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.
Hello?
No joke, ma'am.  Please open the door.
This is a beautiful place.
Caesar is your husband?
Oh no.  Shit.  I didn't know he would call you.  God, you must think |I'm a total nuisance.
I wanted to apologize.
He's a launderer?
You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.
You didn't want to see me, did you?
What are you afraid of?
All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
We make our own choices and we pay our own prices.  I think we're more alike than you want to admit.
Caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |Shelly's books to figure out how he did it.
All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying.
The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.
Then what?  Exactly.
He'll have to run.
I had a partner and she fucked me.
He totally freaked.  I've never seen him like this.  He's out of his fucking mind.
What if he doesn't run?
Oh, God.
No.  We can't risk it.
What do you mean?
So now you know.
I think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea.  How does it feel to be dead?
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
You are a friend of his?
Mr. Kane...  Come right in...please...have a seat.
We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking.  Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
Jesus...
You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that?
Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
What are you talking about?
Okay, so you're a victim.
Where?
-- no -- Marie -- <u>no</u>! -- it's not like that --
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
Shit, we didn't sign in.
Is this it? --  -- this is it, right? --
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
-- and they're sure it's him? --
It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.
What if it doesn't come back?
It's not much, but it should get you to Switzerland.
... fix themselves.
Tuttle! ... mumble!  You've had that scab Tuttle here, haven't you?
This is what you get when you have cowboys round yer ducts.
Oh, yes. We've got everything here. Every bit of knowledge, wisdom, learning ... every experience, every thought neatly filed away.
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...
But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...
Yes, it's all a bit confusing but, it seems she was killed resisting arrest.
Long time no see!
What's the matter?
Sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed -
{winking at Sam) She doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really.
Remember how they used to stick out?
You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.
OK. OK. Let's not fence around ... This is the situation. Some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, B58/732 and T47/215.
What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
Say it was a mistake.
Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
You stupid bastard!
You think these are tits don't you?
I bet you'd like to touch them?
What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!
Alright! Alright! Alright! I'm Information Retrieval Officer -  DZ/015, and I'm arresting you for - your own good! Now start up and get moving before I hand you back to them! 
Don't litter my cab!
Why not?
Where are you taking me?
Look at that - right on time.
Security.
What?
Jill! What are you do ... I mean ... how did you ... Are you alright?
Don't you like parties?
Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long.
There we go. Mrs. Veronica Buttle. What's the number on the cheque?
I've go to accept that promotion to get behind this, haven't I?
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
Sod it, it's broken!
Lime, I need to use your computer
Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please.
Numero une, crevettes  la mayonaaise. 
Mr Helpmann was very close to your poor father. He was very close to me. Still is. He'll take you under his wing at Information Retrieval. You'll like it when you get there.
Mother? Is that you?
Is Mr Helpmann here?
Uh ...
Whatever happened to you?
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
I can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?
This is an emergency!
Hello ... hello ...
Put the phone down and your hands up.
My I.D. cards.
Yes?
I mean it fixed itself.
The pace?
Can you walk? Puedes caminar?
It's okay, Kanita. Come on in.
Frank, take it easy. what happened?
Where is she?
Is this what you gave Mary?
They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm.
You're not going to die.
That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?
Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, I can be out quick. if anything happens, I'll be in apartment 16M.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
Who is it?
You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.
Rule number one: Don't get involved with patients. Rule number two: Don't get involved with patient's daughters. You understand?
We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
I'll drink to that.
No.
He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
These are hard times, Tom.
Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.
The brakes are shot.
I don't know--let's break some windows.
Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us--
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk.
Hi, Aaron...What's doing?
How <u>you</u> doing?
Keep it to yourself.
Everybody has one like that.  I thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end.
No.  Don't worry about it.
Hold it down, okay?
Yes.  You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?
Okay.
Hi.  Turn on your TV... <u>Good Morning America</u>, the <u>Morning News</u> and <u>Today</u> are all about to talk to Arnold Schwarzenegger and I think he's live on at least two of them.
Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now.  But he's not ever gonna change.  He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie.  He feels no different.  He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.
Where's where I asked him about being scared?  You should work on your speech.
Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
Well, whatever you think.
You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
Yes.
<u>If</u>...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment.
No.
Do you feel good about it?
Do others feel that you did well?
I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
I've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me.
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
Let's go...
We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased.  All right?
Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?
All this business of war -- do you get scared?
Okay.  I just wanted you to know.
Jane?
Yeah, I know, I went back and forth on it.
Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.
They're not really going to call security are they?
Yes.  That's right.
No...no.
What?
...and the White House is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do.
Anchor?
I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more.  You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you?
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
As long as that's your only problem you're...
I never told you the reason I was telling you everything for.
I'm sorry if I was in the way.  It was totally impressive.  Great piece.
I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.
So he was indicted?
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
Jane?
There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.
It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.
It's not important.
So what did you think?
At least kiss me when you do that.
What?
That's not it.
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
No.  Did he really?
Why?
It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
I don't wan to discuss work.
You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...
Well, why not?  Hey, what is this?  My life's rushing in front of my eyes.
You're saying stay away from him.
I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.
This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
The last time I was with someone we went through this awful mutual disease questionnaire but I guess it beats getting paranoid the next day.  Okay, I'll go first.  I haven't...
I just need you for another minute now, so we can shoot from behind towards me, and, um...
Would you like to do me?
That's not true I am a sculptor!
If you were an artist you could have created something!
That doesn't look like very much clay.
Are you nervous, Walter?
Let's see it.
Hi Walter.
Where where...
Are you ready?
Nice night out...
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?
Walter...I can't believe it.
I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
Hi Walter...
You've arrived.  You've been recognized.  You're a talent, a creative force to be reckoned with.
What's the matter with you?
Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know?  I'm an artist.  I'm not like a banker, you know.  Like I create.
Man this is heavy!
Man, why do you suppose Walter wants to get her alone?  You suppose he could be physically attracted to her?
Well I brought something, I wanted to show you.
Well...why did you put a knife in it?
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
A show?!  Like this Sunday?
You might talk too much.
Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning, isn't it?
Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -
You like chasing the dragon, Walter?
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse!  Junk!  Heroin!
Wait a minute!  What'd I do?
Wait a minute - I told you I didn't do nothing wrong!
Are you done with these?
An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...
After that we go no more!
With Dead Cat.  Like a breath of fresh air.  I could just - babble on about it for hours.
I want you to have it.  There's a little something for you in here...
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
Buffy!  Looking tasty.
They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
When you get your car together, man, let's bail.
Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!
Which way did she go?
Dying.
Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe it's that outfit...
Something like that.
What show is this?
I can't get sick.  You know -- training and all.  I'm gonna be late.
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
Buffy, what are you doing here?
You broke up with my machine?
You left me a message?
You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?
Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this.
Thanks.
Who?
I'm going to the dance.
Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.
What did Jeffrey's dad say?
I didn't learn... I just... it's not a big deal.
Excuse me for having something important to do.
I'm glad you guys are here.  It's good to see you.
Why?
You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
How do you know all this?
I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
Sporting events, yeah.
Who we gonna beat?
Put your head back.
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
Five?
Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy.  I've got a few things the other girls didn't have.
Another distraction.  It's not right.
Football is my life.
Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie.
Cool.  We can figure decorations and stuff.
-- like she's gonna kill me.
I haven't seen him tonight.
I find it restorative, sleeping in the life-blood of so many.  To feel their souls coursing about me.
No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful.
Bessel!  What are you doing here?
Write that down.
Oh, yes!  Yes!
She didn't even hardly talk to anyone in school.  All year.  She didn't even go to the prom.
You're kidding.
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
God!  Take a chill lozenge.
The homelesses?
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
God I'm tired.  What a trip I was lousy.  I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom.  I--
God...I think I'm gonna be sick--
Death is like spring training?
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
That's my leg.
He didn't mean it nasty.  He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.
It's Skip, for you.
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
You should be at the game.
She's dancing with me.
After 12 years in the minor leagues, I don't tryout.  Besides-- I don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart...or loins.
But you were pulling your hips last night.
247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.
I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
And he's right!  A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often.  You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are!  And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.
I doubt that.
Thurman Munson.  He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ...  And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition!  So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.
You think I could make it to the Show as a manager?
Oh dear....easy honey...
Let's have a quick word of prayer, right here, to thank the Lord for all this--
Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?
Hey!  What're you guys doing here-- stealing my girl?
Drive off your back leg.  You pitch with your legs as much as your arms-
What do I got?
Can I ask you something?
Annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while I'm on the mound, thus keeping my brain slightly off center, which is where it should be for artists and pitchers.  She also said I should throw whatever pitches you call for.
I was great, eh?
You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
"...Good Lord willing, things'll work out."
I don't wanta fight you, I wanta thank you.  Let's have a drink and forget this--
Sorry about last night.
Well, I got Annie all warmed up for ya...  She's just waiting for you to show up, y'know...
Crash Davis?
Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?
I'd kill ya.
We fight, she gets the clown-- how's that happen?
No.
Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once.  Sold Lady Kenmores--it's nasty, nasty work.
The organization wants to make a change...now that Nuke's gone they wanta bring up some young catcher...
Crash ain't there.  He never gets back till four or five--
Thank you.
...was gonna stop what came up next at the casino.
Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer - answer that at this time.
He even played golf with the President.
You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog.
Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.
I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad?
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
...stupid things.
Hello.
She's not here, Sam.
I'll call you right back.
Now this is just a signature card.
Amy! Amy, open the door!
Mommy.
...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.
But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
Okay, Sammy.
But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.
But I'll tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds. He knew all the fuckin' angles. He brought over the whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. But he forgot how lazy them European dancin' broads can get. I mean, he had to weigh 'em in once a week to make sure they didn't blow up like fuckin' balloons.
You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already.
I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book.
My wife?
...don't do it to me...
Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
This guy is gonna run to the FBI.
I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
How'd you know I was here?
She's there with you?  She's there with you?
Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her!
Legally, she can't take that stuff. Legally, she can't take the stuff.
Half of everything is mine.
...position...
...and she doesn't always -
But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
I had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week.
Fuckin' asshole won't budge.
To Abraham Lincoln.
Sam, we got a problem.
So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day?
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
Oh, fabulous.
Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?
Why do you need that much?
What are you talkin' a- ?
Okay, no big deal. That's okay. Yeah. He got his twenty-five.  That I'll live with. Any more I couldn't.
So, what'd ya do with it?
I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
Get off of me! Stop it!
You threw it away?
...she did what she did and I did what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could've done.
Hi, Sam.
I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.
I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, I'm not gonna let her in, the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm -
Well...
You didn't see the scam? You didn't see what was goin' on?
You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
No, Sir.
A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did.
Fuckin' kids at home!  Here.  Get the fuck out of here.
Hey... you got a minute? Hey. He's got two million in the box, am I right?  Okay, you let him keep your jewels. We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about.  Huh?  Her majesty. We go to Europe. You dye your hair, get some pl-
You know where she gets this from!
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
You gotta go back out there.
Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
Carmine left?
Artie!
What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed.
Are you sure?
Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian- American slang for 'I'm counting on you']
Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about?
Thank you.
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
Yeah.
Let me think about that.
Yes, you did.
Yeah.
I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death.
...same outfit.
Don't make me come there. Answer me.
We'll go later.
Don't give me any of your shit!  Okay, this has always been a dream, but we're going.
Right.
...they're in Penthouse K.
Incredible.
'Cause it clogs up your heart.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come here, come here.
I mean, the cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck. I mean, you know, they all worked it out together.
Fine. Everything's goin' good.
Sue me, you Jew fuck!
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
Tony.
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...
Hiya. That's a lot of money to be counting out in public.
Ah, Cats. Now and Forever.
This is insane. Let the heroes handle it.  I'd better get you home...I should check on my warehouse to make sure it hasn't been hit...
Oh now, you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all?
I thought you said you weren't a very good liar.
I can. That's not an admission of guilt,  It's just..I knew you had it in you...
You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes.
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
Don't you realize there's nothing you can do, anyway!  Nine minutes and it's all over!  The Fun Palace is a tomb. No one can get out. And choke on this furball: all doors and windows are blocked, locked, and electrified!  Even the glass around the bomb is rigged.
The "skylight?" Fool!  It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
The shopkeeper on 13th street won't drop the lawsuit--He still claims one of the lasers we fired at the Jenkins gang burned down his store..
"Dat's gotta hurt!"
Well, we spent enough time building the damn thing, might as well use it.
The Tranquilizer Tranquility will hold for about an hour..where is she? These women are out here on a lark-- Ladies Night at a discotheque.  It's not in their blood the way it is for Catwoman...Where is she?
How can you say things with such feeling and then turn around and put on a helmet and...Who are you?  Were you sitting on my right or my left at the card table?  Tell me!  Please tell me who you are; you own me that!
For when the time comes..
"Save the City?" I don't want to save the city, I want to move!  Listen, I'm sure the computer disc is pretty fascinating and I can't thank you enough for the little weird gold thingie, but..
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
What if I were to say "You're Fired?"
I don't know what came over me.
Nothing. How's your hand?
Like you don't know...
You're late.
I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag...
They're going to attack Frank's Fun Palace!
Any place.
Was someone in an accident?
What are you doing on Theo's line?
Be careful.  There were people in that crosswalk.
Who's on the phone?
What was that for?
He's right, Theo.  She might not be around to back up your story. You could end up in the middle of this.
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
You switched license plates?
I don't like anybody laying their hands on me.
I thought you said you could handle him.
Don't fuck around.  Pop a cap in him.
He took it like a man.  Toss him in that drainage ditch.
Nels?
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
Well I'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when I'm about to make the most important score of my life.  This has gotta be some "put-on," right?
Don't lay this on me!
Tell me what she looks like.
Where's the fucking recharger cord?  Must be in her car, dammit.
I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.
Our house always needs touching up.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
Does she wear glasses?
I've got a lot of respect for you too.  For the way you feel about your family.
Why tell me this?
Thank you.  God bless you for helping us.
He's in back.  Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  I never heard Jack cry before --
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
Rachel -- Oh my God.
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
Damned if I know.
Who's in back?
Not all.  They already have a third.  The question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back?
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
You, I would've noticed.
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
It could be a fire.  This is Malibu.
What's Nels' number?
Think you could do a picture of me?
You've had a lot of fun with me today.  What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?
Yeah, I was waiting for that suggestion.
What's your point?
Naturally.
I'm handling it.
I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
I've got ... one last number for you, Theo ...
Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
You're making it too easy.
You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison.  He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
What time frame have you got in mind?
We're waiting on you.
I'm opening the side door.  She'll step out.  But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view.  If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back.
Stop the crying.
Yeah.  Why don't we?
Who am I talking to?
Okay Nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about.  I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.
You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.
You researched me.  You know where I live.  She'll be waiting for you there along with your split.
I can see the benefit in that.
We're gonna get there first.
Seems not.
Let me talk to the lady again.
You sure know how to take a lot of punishment.
Just cut his hair, you know.
Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col.
He agreed that he was.
Thank you.
Don't chuck my clothes out!
I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.
Doesn't the water get to your nails?
You American?
What's that about?
You got a special friend, Jimmy?
Jesus Christ!
That Dave?
What would he think?
I think you do.
Drink.
What you thinking of, hon?
Even now.
Come on, Dil --
Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say.
I didn't mean to hit you.
That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
What?
She's the thing you had to tell me.
You'd do anything for me?
You promise?
You're no good at this, Jimmy.
Why?
Why are we going here, Jimmy?
Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing here?
Lifted him from a carnival in Belfast. Held him hostage for three days.
Yes.
Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me, too.
Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.
See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I can't do that. Yet.
More endearments.
Then say it.
You've got to go now, Dil --
Meet Col --
I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm counting the days. Two thousand three hundred and thirty-four left.
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
So what do you need, Fergus?
Have a look at him.
So you did fuck up.
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
Dil!
Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.
Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep tonight, Fergus.
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
Who is he?
Thank you, handsome.
You're going to have to do it, aren't you?
What makes you think that?
I'm not a gambling man.
C'mere.
What the fuck am I doing here.
Best game in the world.
Now, that was worth waiting for.
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
Do you?
Is it bad?
She can't help it.
What?
Take the whole lot. I won't need it.
Nothing.
Take the hood off, Fergus --
Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?
Faster than cricket?
Don't run off, Jude.
And you know what?
Not here.
Come and get me, soldier --
Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my mama didn't raise no stupid children. I know who's got the money 'n I ain't disappearing till I got my share -- 'n' my share's growin' a whole lot bigger ev'ry day.
Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on --
Oh!
I know why you're not taken -- no one can catch up with you.
That wraps it up -- Tex has the money. Go back to bed -- I'll let you know when I've found him.
If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
What is it?
But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it.
Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.
But I didn't kill anybody.
Then say it.
Only we call them agents.
Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
Why not?
Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
Starting with his own.
You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
Do I knock or something?
Keep going.
And stop threatening that boy. He doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert doesn't either.
Not my room!
Does it hurt?
Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.
I think Tex did it.
What's so illogical about that?
Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie.  Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
Hm?
Yes, I know.
I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?
Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that.
I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?
Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.
Why don't you shut up!
Monsieur Flix -- ?
The money is unimportant.
In your money, perhaps $65,000.
Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
What for? If it's not here, why bother him?
What do you mean, no?
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
I was, too.
No -- in my room.
Oh, la.
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- !  What's that?
I don't know -- how would I know?
How's that?
I'm not sure I --
Oh. I guess.
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Are you in the book?
What are you doing here?
I'm still having trouble with English.
What was it?
Nothing. Good night.
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
So they think he left it with you.
I'm so hungry I could faint.  I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet.
Yes -- that's right.
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
Miz Lampert, ma'am...
He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but --
With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends.
He knows everything.
He must have known Charles pretty well.
I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
Yeah?
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
You do?
What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy.
I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS.
I get all your CDs.
One more time.
No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
A little.
Ok.
Who is she Daddy?
You found her?
We need you here. I can bring her in.
As bizarre as it may sound, seems someone is planning to have a big party tonight.
Should we close down any eruption?
What are you doing?
Hello?
Of what?
No, you couldn't.
Really?
Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown. Kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school. It's turning into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert.
Pay no attention to me.
Please get out of my way or I'll have to hurt you.
What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
No!
Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us.
Mark invited me to the party.
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
You can't tell your parents.
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
This place is empty.
Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.
All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid.
Jody. Wait.
I need to ask you something.
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
Mr. Sisler was one of them.
What?
Let me just ask you a serious question first.
 Oh...
...if we don't get out of this tunnel!
A little early for a delivery.
That's my business.
Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
Then you drive me to McGrud-...
...fine.
We can't push old Pete in this heat.  He can't take it.
Ah, one of them's in the back.
...work!  It's not even load-...
 Nice job back there.
I was thankin' you, asshole!
...I'm not the psycho.
You wanna hit me?
...I believe in live and...
...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!
Fuck! 
 I should've had that dog bite me.  I would've gotten rabies! Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse!
I made it!
...ho!
 Listen!  Listen...
Oh, no!
Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
 Yeah.
I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
All right, all right.  Hey, hey.
Ow!  
We're gonna die!
Put your hand in my pants.
 All right.  Okay.
Okay. 
Arlo!
Okay. 
You got Elvis?!
We!
Okay...
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.
What?
Hang on, hang on.
What'd you come back for?!
Thank you very much.
Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
I feel faint.
I got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's...
Your move.  Okay, Vaughn, you drive.
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?
 ...to Fort McGruder in his truck. 
No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.
We've got it...
Exactly.
...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act.
They were all wearing hardware.
Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!
No, go--
...-ple.
...men every time I've closed my eyes?  But after you went away, I--
All right.  After they put you away...
Do you know what'll...
Good to see you again, Leo.
And I'm warning you, Leo.  Don't test me. Get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die.
...comes up that road.
Dutiful citizens, you have something which I have waited years for.
Hit him.
This was supposed to be a...
What about these two?
I'm on it.
...to pursue a man who's stolen government proper-...
Right.  Tim Mason.
Richard Long.
You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
...should be right outside.
...your concern nor your fight.  Relinquish the package and you can go.
And I can't guarantee the end will be quick.
...the river.
...-tainer!
No.
And don't give him any ice cream...
Oh, no?
...well, most of the time he looks like something the cat might have dragged in, but, you know...
Rangers.
Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  I told you Mason was walking shit.
Deputy Art Lewis, Jerome County Sheriff's Department.
What the hell are you talkin' about...
Well, I've got Dr. Long's body down at the coroner's office.
Morning, doc.  Awful early, aren't ya?
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.
...without caution...
Mason.
The compound has to be kept cold...
And only then does our noble friend realize...
...you, Mason?
Mason, what is the temperature of Elvis?!
There's a vent shaft leading straight up.
...stole a truck under arrest.
...on the other end of this phone.
  All right.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Okay, doc.
 We've gotta take out Brynner's van before  they reach...
It's too late, Mason. I've...
Now!  Seal that tunnel now!
But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
Lou Escobar  he's a Lieutenant.
Very.
None.
Too bad?
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
Where is she?
Haven't the faintest idea.
You've got her? Where?
What's that, Curly?
I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.
Yes.
I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.
Congratulations.
No. It was an accident.
What are you doing here?
How do you happen to know her?
Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.
I know what he says.
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
You never learn, do you, Gittes?
It looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. Could he swim?
But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?
Would you like something to drink?
You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem.
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
You left your keys in the ignition.
Stop it. The money's fine. It's generous but you've shortchanged me on the story.
Sorry. Look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. Excuse me. Then you ask me to lie to the police.
And you weren't the slightest bit upset about it?
Over the water department, or over you?
Then it was over the water department.
Oh, yeah?
Know him?
There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.
Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
What's wrong?
The Albacore Club.
I saw him.
I want you to listen to me. My father is a very dangerous man. You don't know how dangerous. You don't know how crazy.
You know what I mean. You're keeping her there against her will.
J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar
Hollis came and took... care of me... after she was born... he said... he took care of her... I couldn't see her... I wanted to but I couldn't... I just want to see her once in a while... take care of her... that's all...  but I don't want her to know... I don't want her to know...
Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
Never?
When it comes.
That's a long fall.
Gittes?... Gittes?
Yeah?... I do?
How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?
Of course not.
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
Julian Cross worked for the water department?
He owned the entire water supply for the city?
They were partners.
Apple core?
Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing?
Lots of fellas do. Tell the little woman they're going on a fishing trip, then shack up with some little twist on the island... she pretty?
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she was knocked up and didn't even know who the father was. Went there to get rid of it.
'I choose my friends for their looks, and my enemies for their brains...'  You're too smart to be my friend. Besides, as I always tell my kids, be careful to pick the right friends!
I told my mother you weren't the one who gave me the films. That it wasn't your fault. But I thought you said the film could catch fire just to scare me. Now that I know, I won't steal any more from you. That's all I wanted to say. I'm going. 
Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso? 
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
I don't care. I'll wait.
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
My husband...you know him.
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.
I don't remember him any moreMa, where's Russia?
Toto, this is no film for the common herd. One day'll be more than enough...So tonight, please set up tomorrow's film, so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready.
Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low...  Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -
Three cents.
You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.
You know how long it took the "Chronicle" to get that staff together?  Twenty years.
I might make him nervous.
He's a great guy - Leland.  Why'd he ever leave New York?
From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end.  Anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson. He really believed that.  He put all his ambition on that girl.  After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to.  Oh, I don't blame Susie -
Wasted?
Isn't it wonderful?  Such a party!
What's the matter?
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
My little sanctum is at your disposal. But I don't think I understand -
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
Yes, Mr. Kane.
What story, Mr. Rogers?
Hello, Brad -
I know that, Emily -
Have they heard from father yet? Has he seen -
You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you?
Charlie, you're just excited.  You don't realize -
Ow!
Toothache.
You've got some on your face.
What's funny now?
Oh!
No.  That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -
Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six -  I run a couple of newspapers.  How about you?
Is that what you want to do?
It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses.
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
Don't tell me you're sorry.
I understand that you have political ambitions.  Unfortunately, you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own -
I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company.
I happened to see your consolidated statement yesterday, Charles.  Could I not suggest to you that it is unwise for you to continue this philanthropic enterprise -  this Enquirer - that is costing you one million dollars a year?
Get Dr. Corey.
Say, Brad.  I've got an idea.
Yes?
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
Charlie!  Now you're not making sense.
You still want to be transferred to the other paper?
It's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher -
I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
Anything and everything - he was a regular crow.
Yes, and maybe he didn't.
Thompson!
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?
Unnhh!
Jesus!
Pack of cigarettes.  What's that?
Excuse me, but...
If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
God, isn't he great?
He was?
My God. I haven't seen you since... 
I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside. She was with Rick Derris.
I'm not pregnant.
No.
The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.
Look how full of yourself you are.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
He's not invited.
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
Was he alive when... Caitlin...
What about Caitlin?
This is the last time I come to this place.
Excuse me, do you have...
Pack of cigarettes.
Shit!
What time do you have to stay till?
Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.
Yeah.
More or less.
You know what else I noticed in Jedi?
The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.
You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said...
The quest isn't going well?
What's a jizz-mopper?
I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.
There aren't.
I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
Why not?
What!?
You hardly knew her!
You hate people.
She was pretty young, hunhh?
I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in.
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
May I be blunt with you?
That's stretching it. You're not being asked to slay children or anything.
You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
Get to work.
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
I didn't think they even enforced this.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
Who eats cock?
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
You just fucked a total stranger?
Around three or something.
That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
Who're you kidding? You can so.
Lovely story.
Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!
I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.
Did you say Caitlin Bree?
Wait a second!  You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree? While I was dating her?
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! Hey!
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like "A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there." That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?
Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work.  I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch.  You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too.
And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...?
Actually, it is kind of rough.
I was kidding.
Typically male point of view.
I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
He requested this?
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?
What is it?
Would you let me explain...
What part of Russia?
You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I didn't even recognize you!
Sure. How about the beach?
I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
Well this is the last time I ever rent here...
For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash.
And... he told you all of this?
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
Willam!
Work!  Don't say that word, man.
That was the first and last question-- now only answers. Where's the chopper?
Looks like the Tower.  It's a bad climb.
Go on, fetch.
Remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times--
What the hell are you doing here?!
Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it--
Gabe?  Gabe, where are you?
Oh, my God!  I can't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar. 
The winds are picking up.
Hello, Gabriel.
I was there, you were the only one who didn't panic.  So do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt.  You held on as long as you could.  Yes, everything did go wrong, starting with Hal. I mean, what was he doing up on the Tower with a girl who could barely climb?
Excuse me?
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
Where?
Why can't things stay the way they are...everything has to change.  What we had was perfect.
Can you see light?
Never, what?!
We don't have time to argue about it!
Take the rope.
Your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.
It's up there, on the Tower.
Murdering, motherfucker...
Tucker, you know where the money is-- I want it.
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
He asked you, how far?!  I think you've been taking the scenic route.  How far from here?
Travers!  Hurry it up.
I don't trust him.
This is insane.  The hell with the money.  You radio in for that chopper, understand!
Is it set?
What's the code, Travers?
I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
He are here! He have arrived! Hooray!
One minoota, droogie. Dim smashes Alex in the face with a full milk bottle. He goes down. The others run away, laughing.
Good evening, sir.
Thank you very much, sir. Cheers Suddenly the thought occurs to Alex that the wine may be drugged or poisoned.
Help you.
Much better, thank you, sir.
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
Well, yes, it's just a manner of speech from your Post Corrective Advisor to you that you watch out, little Alex. He puts his arm round Alex's shoulder.
It's alright, thank you.
You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
Do you still feel suicidal?
Not tonight - not this nochy.
I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
Helping you, sir?
Well, who can blame them, sir?
Surprise?
Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you.
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
No thanks, Mum. It'll pass in a minute...  ... What have you done with all my own personal things?
What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?
Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell.
What do I want?
Religion?
Do you mean Church of England?
Have you ever had any mental illness?
No, sir.
I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
Are you referring to the background score?
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Good. You can do whatever you like with these.
You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.
Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.
Mothballs, sir.
Very good, Chief. They inspect cells.
Yeah... Pete the English.
Moloko-plus.
Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.
Well, what's the matter lad, are you feeling alright?
I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
But not now?
No, no way, I couldn't take that...
Where are you, what floor?
This your current address?
A deer?
Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  Louis was playing.  God was smiling.
No.
You know Dmitri?
What kind of question?
Lay it on me.
Vincent.  Do not cross me.
As a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, I'd like to offer you a discount for my services tonight.  Twenty five percent.
...goddamn it, you telling me this motherfucker's whacked three of our witnesses tonight...
...got off the phone with his dispatcher.  What an asshole. Cabbie's name is Max Rilke, been driving that cab for ten years...
...so, his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo.  That guy?  That guy is a cabbie.  And you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?
Lemme tell you something.  Vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts.  Nobody even know what he looked like until now...
...this snitch of yours, what's his name, Ivan?
There was a car here, you can see where the glass came down all around it.  Ivan flew out the window and went bam.
Client?  I like to think of myself as more of a friend.  A mentor.
Quite an achievement...
I got caught up at work.
Max?  Maaax.  Pick up, dipshit.
It got crashed!  I didn't...
...why is everything always about you...
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
Uh, let's go to...  Hello...?
Twenty-four?  Not twenty-five?  Or twenty-three?
You should start a union.
Oh?  How long you been doing this?
No.  You say you're cool.
Got it?
Max.  May we leave the scene of the crime now, please.
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
What do you care?  Ever hear of Rwanda?
That one's probably married.  Think of his kids.  His wife's pregnant...
It was an accident.  You're not liable.  Tell him.
But, hey, some good news.  This last one put me way ahead of schedule. We've actually got some time to kill.  Jazz?  You like jazz?
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
Pull your head out of your ass.  Get your thinking straight.  You wanna die?
Show up for what?
You go every night?
Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
What, no insurance?
I'll just hold onto it for you.  In case they check.
Our friends in Little Russia.  Go in and ask for a man named Dmitri.
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
When he finds out you tossed his list? I would.
You get benefits?
Would you have called her?
...all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X-ray vision...
Max?
She must be some girl.
Look, I'm sorry --
<u>Jerry</u>?  You didn't show last night.  First time ever.  Had me worried, boy.
Saved you last night's, too.
The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line.  They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
Nothing scary there.  Sorry.
If my universe had a hub...
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  <u>In Newport</u>.
I don't know what to say.  I love you.
I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day.  To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way.  Everything you do is magic.
What is it?
How do you really know there's gold in Fort Knox?  Just because they say so?  We should go to Tennessee and demand to see it.
Blue moon... Blue moon...
Without a song in my heart.
You've been my best friend for years and I didn't even know you were out there.
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
I'll do it.  On one condition.  I want to make sure she's okay.
Then screw you.  I'll rot.
<u>Why you</u>?
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
I didn't know the C.I.A. had psychiatrists.
Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
Where'd you get it?
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
Night after that?
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
Which way did he go?
Jonas?
Can I talk to you a second?
We've lost contact.
Hope there's a cartoon.
-- Or 'you're our kind of people --'
Peter sends his regards.
Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
What is it?  What's happened?
You mean --
David --
I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair...
And?
How can that be?
Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker.
I'll come right to the point, Doctor.  Your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of National Security.
... I don't understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
Please answer the question, Doctor.
Could we hear to China?
Could we hear to the moon?
Can you show me?
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
Am I one... or many?
No more stalling, Captain.
S.R. Hadden...  You compromised our security codes.
Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
Not if you think like a Vegan.
A sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes.
What's that?
You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham?
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made.  I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...
If we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it.  This time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology.  The moment when contact becomes possible.  We've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now.
Greenbank?
You sonofabitch.
Peter... What is going on?  Has everyone gone completely insane?
And you believe this law with all your heart and soul.
So.  Is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this?
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.
If you came back.  If you survived at all.  Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't.
During the crusades -- pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they'd actually been there.  I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land, so...
Ellie, what is it?
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to your opinion.  But we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown, completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless.
I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
Fifty cents? Sweet job like that worth at least a buck.
Buck is a deal.
Well, Arletta, I got to stand down here.
No.
You allus had good jobs, and that girl in Kentucky I taken a shine to her.
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
I'm leavin' the place to John.
Then how come it ain't done yet?
He ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.
You gonna get used to wearing them chains aftera while, Luke. But don't you never stop listenin' to them clinkin'. That's gonna remind you of what I been sayin'.
In the Navy, we used to call guys --
You can't do that!
Borrowin' or payin' back?
He ain't eating beans fer lunch.
Dragline, lemme look at the picture.
Man, this here Newmeat parking meter bandit thing what calls itself Luke don't know nuthin' 'bout nuthin'.
Maybe he's been chain-ganging too long.
Lucille? Where do you get that?
Whatta you mean, forget it?
Nuthin'! A handfull of nuthin'!  You stupid mullet-head. He beat you with nuthin'! Just like today when he kept coming back at me.
What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.
Look at Him go. Bam! Bam!
What you talkin' about, Luke? We're together, you and me, just like always. Now the thing we gotta work out is how to get Koko outa there and then the Terrible Trio be all complete again. Man, this old Free World ain't gonna know which ear to stand on.
What you mean, Luke?
But, Luke...
Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.
Picture's a phoney... Cost me a week's pay.
He doesn't know when to give in. They'll kill him.
I want to die.
When are you going to call them?
Where have you <u>been</u>?  What happened to your wallet?
He was lying.
He told me he had done two others just like it.
When he was seventeen.
You don't listen very good.  This break in -- I can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole.  Or I could see it gets forgotten.
She's supposed to have it.
What book?
Ah ha.  What did he want?
You like that action?  Didn't that cop on TV look <u>solemn</u>?  The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.
Kill me, Peter, do it, now.
We'll keep talking.  Until they get here.  Then... 
Oh, please.  I know what's coming, now.  "Let me help you..."
I want to tell you it's a great honor to meet you and talk to you.
The bodies have been carefully arranged... different positions, but somehow the same.  The positions are brutal... yet quite... artful.  It's like... a signature.  He's proud of his accomplishments.  There are early Picassos and late Picassos, but you always recognize the hand.  He wants us to recognize <u>his</u> hand. I've seen this hand before... what are you hiding?
Ruben.
You're afraid of him.
I just thought it was so -- unprofessional.  Of you both!
The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes...
I don't want this.  What are they?
Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.
I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest of it?
The lock...
Open the door.  Please.
You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  Where did he pick her up?
Sure.  She likes <u>you</u>, Rube.  She likes the way you move.  She sure as hell isn't in love with me.
She's blue as hell.  No marks on her neck.  Asphyxiated?  not the same -- no ligature marks.  Outdoors...
This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of Commerce don't want TV announcing killers on the loose.
We're gonna have a bunch of clapped out old hippies blissing on the Grateful Dead!  Sleeping in the park, smoking dope and sticking tulips up their ass.
I'm <U>telling</u> you.  Don't you <u>ever</u> address me publicly in that tone. You'll work what and <u>who</u> I tell you to work.
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him?
I just got here myself, Susan.
We were together six years, sir!
See, now you've annoyed her.  You know she doesn't like you to touch me.  Does she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve you so much!  Did you feed her?
Not a lot of action here.
If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
Where's the car?
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
He must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his. It's like a bed on wheels. It must smell of semen...
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
They're questioning Vaughan about an accident near the airport. Some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally.
I thought that was you, up there.
After this sort of thing, how do people manage to look at a car, let alone drive one?  I'm trying to find Charles's car.
The airport? Why? Are you leaving?
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
I've found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. "Anywhere", I said.
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
Are we allowed to park here?
Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus' Facel Vega, or Nathaniel Nest's station wagon, Grace Kelly's Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't touch anything else.
It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why.
This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
What kind of place is this?
The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.
What?
She says she won't even come if Dad brings Monica.
Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could throw you an engagement party maybe.
How can I help?
I can't believe you finally gave me the shirt.
You're slowing.
But what am I going to do?
How wonderful, darling.  What does that mean for you?
Will you get time off to do that?
Are you sure, Dear?
Mom, please.
I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.
Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
It's so good to see you, Sweetheart.
We aren't allowed to wear jewelry in here, Mom.
I'm only looking out for you.
Yeah?
It had this red spot on its back.
I don't mean to go on and on like this.
Let me shift gears here a minute...  Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
A while, I guess.
You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner.
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
He asked me to marry him.
Guess.
I had to sneak by the guards to get here. They say you're highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery.
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
It's a good thing my family loves you.
You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, "It's a good thing I love you."
Where to?
It's TV heaven.
Good luck.
Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?
Gosh, Letty, this is a great place.
This must be Beast.
The store was busy.
Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
Silly, silly, silly.
I guess we need to talk.
I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to blame you.
Don't you have a magic trick or something to make this easier?
But what about that math project?
No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.
Of course not, no.  Is that why you're here?
Yes, I suppose so.
I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time...
Exactly. It's time to make decisions.
So will you?
Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.
Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
No.
You've already robbed the safe?
Where's your brother?
I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
Okay. I understand you're interested in one of our properties?
And?
Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
But you were there?
You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.
I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.
I just want you there in case there's trouble.
Besides, we don't know the city and--
Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.
I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine.
This is Zero.
It's not?
What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something.
All right, knock it off.
Hadley --
Hello?
I will.
Don't bullshit me.
Okay, we're square now, right?
They were all French guys.
But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.
There has to be.
What about transportation?
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
I don't know.     Maybe if we did just leave --
Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.
Mr. Zammito?
I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.
I would like to thank you for your hospitality.  If you are ever in Paris here is my number.
Holy shit.
I said knock it off! Now as far as I'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we've got to figure out what's going on.
It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.
Why?
Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?
You're back!
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual? You couldn't even decipher the symbols!
Hello.  What is your name?
Put them down.
I'll socialize with whomever I please.
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
Where is he now?
Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's sword.
Stop it!  You don't deserve the Green Destiny.
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
No.
True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
You did your job well.  But, this girl... I saw her last night.
Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence.  My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.  Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.
We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in.
I'll look around and catch up later.
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts.  She's being so considerate.
You're mistaken.  We're just street performers.  We were rehearsing.
I don't know...
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
What in the hell... do you call that?
Speak up.  Clear it with the Captain if you need a file.
Are you nuts, walking into a gun?
You sorta looked like you might need my help.
Don't interfere.
Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man.  I nearly had a fucking heart attack.
I can pick out a tune now and again.
You gotta go now, I bet.
What's going on...?
You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.
I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star.
Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...
Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.
Get it?
Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
Coupla more rings... 24k.
Who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead.  When he begins to care about the living, you'll find his heart can bleed... and I want it to bleed for me.
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you.
Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
What do you mean?
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
Annette, how long have we known each other?
You promise not to say anything?
Got a boyfriend back home?
I read your teen beat manifesto.
I must say I found it rather appalling.
Oh really?
Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.
You're naked.
Need a lift?
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
That's none of your business.
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
Somerset Maugham.
I don't.
My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino.
Because I'm in love with you.
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
Good for you.
Please don't go.
Hi.
Ben Schwarz.
German.
Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
Are you shitting me?
So, rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very nice.
That was cool.
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
Cecile, you have to tell me.
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
Cecile, you had an orgasm.
But I thought high school is only four years.
What are you doing?
You think?
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
But you said you have the worst reputation.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.
Greg, is that you under the covers?
Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about.
And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got...
Sorry.
Jesus Christ, is she for real?
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
What's wrong with you?
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
Moving along quite well.
Any day now.
Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that.
Who are you spying on?
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh.
Bad time?
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
A little melodramatic, don't you think.
To my triumph, of course.
I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.
You're too kind.
What about her?
Who the hell do you think you are?!
First of all, maam, I never touched your daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines.
Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -
Right after we played backgammon.
Did she show up?
Hey Ronald.
Oh, hello.
Did you ever make a wish?
Someone gave it to you? Where was this old house?
Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.
She was very pretty.
Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
What is it, Alice?
It's your play.
Where did you get it?
Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
Amy, not that old tree!
But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?
And who did the voice belong to?
These are all from me.
Amy, answer me. Why did you call her your friend?
But where do you come from?
Will you be friend for always?
I shall want you for always.
I can sea its breath in the cold.
You?
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
Bad luck to see death in the snow.
Mommy read it to ne.
My daughter, Barbara, died when she was six. That was long ago. You're only the woman who keeps care of me. I know you.
I hate the storm. I hate it!
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
Mother! You called me by name!
Let the child stay.
On the dark nights  on the stormy nights -- you can hear him. He passes like the wind; The flapping and fluttering of his great cloak beating like gaunt wings. The thunder of his horse's hooves is loud, loud and louder, beating hard, beating strong on the frozen ground as he comes riding, riding, riding.
...At the hour of midnight, down the road that goes through Sleepy Hollow, across the bridge, he goes galloping, galloping, always searching, always seeking
When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
I thought we were going to save those leaves you were burning for the compost bin.
"To Daddy from Amy." Here's one for Miss Callahan. This one says, "To Edward from Amy.".
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
I have cramps. I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret.
Where are all the mediums?
Maybe they have to pee.
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
No, did you fuck him?
He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up.
I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.
Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
Frida, this is a bad time. We're having sex and George actually answered the phone.
So where's this infamous arm now?
You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
Holy shit, I don't know.
How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
Peter knows something.
Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...
This is from a scientist in France, Madame Sconce. "The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. My suspicion is that the only cure is true love."
She died at age 34 in the 1800's. They thought she was crazy. She was banished from her town. Seems her husband shot her.
No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
I thought you and George were getting married.
You don't have to pee.
Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
I did something stupid. I had a courier job -- picking up a package from the airport. It turned out to be money -- so I kind of borrowed it to pay my rent and now these dudes are after me.
I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
Oh, it's nothing.
I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild.
What are those?
No, no... But Mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills men you date.
What happened?
Is that how you feel?
You know, I've never seen your cat.
Your breasts feel larger.
Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.
How do you know?
That I'm a doormat of course. The shrink makes more notes.
No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.
I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?
I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?
You can't believe this bullshit.
How the hell is that your business?
You want her sheets?
See he was cheating from the get go.
He was found a few blocks away.
Hey, there was a lot of blood.
Madonna's in Penthouse?
It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
You think mafia hit?
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
Mnunn.  Cold lately.  That night, couple weeks ago.  That was <u>real</u> cold.  Remember that?
What's he doing here?
His wife.
You seem a little edgy.  Everything okay?
What about Thompson, sir?  Wasnt this his case?
Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he needs expert help.
Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...
I need everything on the Jonathan White case.
That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?
I don't know who they are.
Don't know that either.
Where do you think this goes?
Such a joker!  Like your father.
I didn't realise...
If you like.
Can I get my life back?
If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
What happened to you?
I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
Is this dangerous or anything?
Now, remember -- keep it simple.
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
Fine?
Just don't call him, Alan!
We think so.
You mean we get `Dave' to nominate you as Vice President.
No!...  WE didn't anything...
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
It's not his job -- It's my job!
I'm serious, Dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
Oh my God...
You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...
Well,  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
Dave, the budget's a very complicated thing.  Even I don't understand it sometimes.  Now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
This is wrong, Alan!
Alan...
They re not my attack dogs.
Oh... Hi.
Yeah.
One day my wife says to me 'Why don't you try running for office.  You talk about it all the time, why don't you just do it?'  So I tell my boss I have a dentist appointment and I go down to the registrar of voters on my lunch break.  Next thing I know, I'm a councilman.
What's that?
I would have taken a bullet for I you, Dave.
Thanks for doing this, Ellen.
I care about the homeless.
... . Ellen.
That was quite a thing you did today.
Kind of reminds me of that thing you did back in the state legislature.
Where's home?
Yeah.  Is that funny?
You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't it?  I can't keep all of this a secret.
What?
I never thought I'd...
We're all set,  sir.
His madness....could be from shock.
What do we do? Let'em know we're here....or what?
It can't be. Are we truly in hell?
Miss Henried, I think you better...
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
I can find it myself. I didn't come that far.
They seem to be havin' a good time. Some punishment.
Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys.
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!
What is it?
How long do we have to watch him?
I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the hospital...
It won't work. That's pure nitro you're dealin' with there. That stuff can blow if you look at is funny. What're you gonna do, walk into the Cave carryin' those tubes on feather pillows? You don't have a complete layout of the place. Even if you manage to avoid a fight you won't know where to go.
One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse.
Sir. In the matter of the State versus Private Tyler, I don't want to...
It's because of me.
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
It's been fired.
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
Do they go to Henley Hall?
Oh come on, Cameron, don't you get anything?
Well...
Well, of course not.  It's just that... You could have warned us.
Oh God, it's over now!
I think he's sweet.
Who else was involved in this?
What are you going to do? - Charlie?
Maybe he'll have some advice.  Maybe he'll even talk to your father.
That's your sister school, right?
Oh, hi.  I'm glad you made it.  Did you bring anybody?
Chris!
Knox, I don't believe this!
Look, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late for the play.
What is that?
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.  The Latin term for that sentiment is "Carpe Diem." Anyone know what that means?
Very good, Mr._?
The hoi polloi.  Doesn't it mean the herd?
English.  Way before your time.  It was hard giving it up, I'll tell you.  I'm hearing rumors, John, of some unusual teaching methods in your classroom.  I'm not saying they have anything to do with the Dalton boy's outburst, but I don't think I have to warn you that boys his age are very impressionable.
John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
A yawp?
Excellent!  Have him act.  Give it rhythm!
All the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  Forget her.  Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.
If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost.  That is where they should be.  Now put foundations under them.
You know me, always taking on too much.
I say we go tonight.  Everybody in?
Look at this.
So what do you think of my father?
What?
A Midsummer Night's Dream. What is it?
So?
And now he will?
Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
You the Captain?
Who?
Nobody's shooting nobody...come on, just let us through the hatch!
I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle, then he corked it, sealing it tight, and threw it to a baby octopus. The little sucker felt its way around that bottle, and in less than two minutes, got that cork off, slid inside, and ate that fish.
The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
Don't mind him Finnegan...you remember 25...balls of steel... splashing around in a sea of testosterone.
Great woman your mother. Real foresight.
I assume somebody up there has made sure no distress signal can be sent.
Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job...
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
You don't have to be so touchy.
I'm not rich people.
Got it?
So how do you get from the Bronx to the South China sea?
I was so goddamn close, Finnegan! So goddamn close to my island... I could almost taste the sand...
Oh my god! Oh my god! How do we do it? How do we get there?
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
You know what I'm gonna do after this...I'm gonna get a normal life...
Joey...it's okay...
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
And what have you come up with?
She's gone...
You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you?
I'm not screwing around with you man...I hate the cold water.
Why don't you help us so we can get done faster so we can get the hell out of here?
Fuel up. Need fuel.
You want 'em?
Yes, Albert?
Nick's going?
This is it. Definitely. This is it, but they changed it.
Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, Albert! I mean, what do you think?
That's new, isn't it?
He's serious. Vince is fuckin' serious!
Nick! Nick, you'll kill him!... Easy. Nick, easy! Hey, hey. Vince goes back a long way.
No. None of that.
I love Linda, see. I love Linda more than I can even say.
That's right. That's exactly what I mean!
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
Holy shit!
Rough, huh?
Why?... What do you mean?... Why???
What?
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
What are you doing?
Yeah... All the guys, we're all going huntin'. Like we did. You know? Like we always used to.
Playing?
You have to think about this, Sal. Listen to me, Sal! You have to think about this.
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
Sal!  Sal... Goddamn it, Sal, don't you know anything?
Won't we? Right? Am I right?
You do?
Hey, Nick?
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
Nick, you're wasting your time... Listen to me! You're wasting your time! This is no fucking time for hoping or praying or wishing or any other shit! This is it. Here we are... And we gotta get out!
Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!
No.
See you Monday.
Great. Hey. That's great.
What?
You didn't get a deer?
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
Down I would say... What would you say?
Up a little there... What would you say?
Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
Talk fast.  Polls open in half an hour.
Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.
I want to ask you a few questions.
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
I want to see my wife and kid.
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
What's this?
Mug sheets.
You're working a partner on this.
That's not your zone.  Stick to data entry.
What do you mean he's escaped?! They're not supposed to escape!
I drive.
Got it.  Ejection seat?
I'll inform dispatch.
How then?
You're not pregnant, are you?
Rip Van Winkle.
You treat her nice.
I just heard.
Belle Dee. I'm from over the mountain.
Let's dance together -- Belle.
You're not resting well, are you? I know -- it's that music.  You need your sleep. Is there anything else you want?
Belle --
You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
No -- but I can hardly wait -- Mister -- tell me, will there really be --  -- a man that eats fire?
Mama!
Grandma, look at me!
I am just thinkin' -- now they mightn't like the idea down in Washington.
What do you want?
What's the matter with you?
Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.
Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
.... Miser Stevens' soul, Mr. Stone. Yes -- I am sorry for the disturbance.
What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
Jabez Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document?
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?
And so, Jabez Stone, in the name of the Whig Party of Cross Corners, we offer you the nomination of that party for Selectman.
Yes.
I remember Dad used to say sometimes, when they were handing out hard luck, the farmers got there first.
He's stubborn as a Stone.
Well, I'll be -- there's a rig, turning in, by the gate.
Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
Mary--
Jabez -- once you said we'd never change --
Jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? He won't respect me any more.
But Jabez, I never said that!
Why don't they come --
Mary! Come back ...
Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
Well, son, I'm glad to see a Stone come up in the world again.
What's that you say, Son?
That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, Ma.
What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?
So you've made up your mind to go to the party.
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
No, you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs.
Jabez ...
Just someone from New Hampshire!
Mr. Webster, I presume?
Why, certainly -- but be careful, Mr. Scratch -- Medford rum has an uncanny habit of kicking back, even with old-timers like yourself. 
Me?
The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!
Your Honor -- gentlemen of the jury -- this case need not detain us long. It concerns one thing alone -- the transference, barter and sale of a certain piece of property, to wit, his soul by Jabez Stone. That transference, barter or sale is attested by a deed. I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A.
That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!
Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?
If your friend is hot to trot...I know a couple of mama bears.  ...Or is he married?
Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
So, you go on upstairs to the party, your lady sees you, you run into each other's arms.  Music comes up, you live happily ever after, that it?
What's happening?
John?  Christ, he could fuck this whole thing up...what does he think he's doing?
What are you going to do?
Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
He wasn't lying about Marco:  He's thirty stories down on the street. The other man is Heinrich, and I found his body upstairs.  And his bag is missing.
I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman! I'm telling you!  You're just going to have to kill me --
Bad for your health anyway.
...the circuits that cannot be cut... are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident...You ask for miracles, Theo...I give you the FBI...
Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync.  I think it's me.  Is there a place I can wash up?
Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty.
You wife's made for this business. She know how to drive a hard bargain.
I hear you...  Partner.  And LA's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em.
No, but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors.  One spotters say you got two with that blast.
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --
Powell?  What's going on?
Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?
I am, Sir...Sergeant Al Powell.
The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!
They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you.  I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you.
Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.
Hello.  Hello, Leon.
So... that sure is something.
I did it on my own.  I did this all on my own.  I ain't laying it on anybody.  Nothing on anybody.  I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know.  I am squaring away my accounts with life.  Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow.  Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too!  I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know?  That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip...
I know!
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
Yeah.
Thank you much... and huh, bon voyage.
Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh?
Leon?  Whatsa matter?  They give you a shot down the hospital or what?
Well, you got to get hold of yourself.  You got to talk to him, tell him to give himself up.
You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
What a fuckin' comedy!  WNEW plays all the hits.
Okay, give us the women.
Let Sal come out, take a look. What hope you got?  Quit while you're ahead.  All you got is attempted robbery.
What the fuck do you want?
You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...
All right ... I got some hungry people in there ... I want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ...
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
Hello, Mulvaney here...
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
You got kids?
Why the hell did he do that?  What the hell did I do?
I'll never see them again, Mister Mulvaney.
Yeah.
Ah, Sonny!  Good luck, you know?
I used to, but I stopped.
Your body is the temple of the Lord.
You gonna smoke the cigarette?
Ah, Jesus...
It's the cops.  Shit!
To show that we're negotiating.
Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
We'd kill ourselves.
Sonny -
They're trying to come through the door!
Okay ... okay ... all right, Sal, it's okay.  I got everything straightened out ... it's gonna be okay.
What?
First off, get the lights back on and the air conditioning.
Well, Jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive.
I don't want him.
For God's sake don't start in on Heidi again ...
Oh! And another thing. I am a liar. A pathological liar. There was no day in Danang, no multiple tours in Nam. Just lies to get laid, lies to get respect.  Truth is... I'm scared shitless all the time.
Hello?
Yes.

That's not even true.  I just want a slice.
And I--we--want some Black people up.
Sal, that might be fine, you own this, but rarely do I see any Italian Americans eating in here. All I've ever seen is Black folks. So since we spend much money here, we do have some say.
Why it gotta be about jungle music and Africa?
How come you ain't got no brothers up?
Buggin' Out, I gotta work here.
It's so nice to see a family hanging out together.
As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted by the finest.
No!
I didn't know you had such beautiful hair.
I thank you.
I said my name is Eddie Lovell.
Nice!
You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right.

No, I'm not it.
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
HARRY? Are you okay?
What?
What are you wearing?
Hey look, it's our teacher.
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?
My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
What?
No no no no no.
We're part of a special class taught by the lunch lady, er, I mean Ms. Heller. Maybe you'd like to join us, it doesn't require any walking.
Just a guy I hang out with.
What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
Yeah, go-cart accident.
What's with horse-boy, now he's a bright shiny sun?
You're it.
These are really cold, huh?
I don't know. Owwww.
According to the map, we're just about at school.
Nope. I was right.
You know... She's gonna be all over you like a barrel of monkeys, with her tight shirt and short skirt... Eeeww, it's so faggy I can't even talk about it.
HARRY, can you hear me?
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
LLOYD, what are you doing? That's JESSICA and... my mom.
Captain Rob came back?
You certainly did.
Are, too.
Hey, look. Ice cream.
You found my treasure? Why didn't you tell me.
Hey Lloyd. This looks like another one of your mix tapes.
That makes total sense. The treasure chest was in his office. Which means Principal Collins is a pirate! I'm surprised Captain Rob never mentioned him.
She's one of a kind.
MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your field trip? I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class.
Are you wearing a coconut bra?
Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
I thought I told you to get lost.
Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
My parents are going to wonder where I am.
So what did you say to my parents on the phone?
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
What?
HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.
Oh, baby, you're the bestest.
Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
That's it. I'm done.
HARRY! Lloyd! You guys are a mess.
... If I may quote the twentieth century poet  - Joe Piscahpo:  You look Marvelous...
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I can take care of myself and I'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.
Well I need to get a job and you're telling me that if I join up - I can really come and go whenever I want?
Do I know you?
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
So I'm an "arrrrrs-hole", eh Captain Rob?
Hello, little orphan boy. What happened to you?
Sure.
Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where's Mr. D?
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
That's great, now make a left, then straight!
I'm not sure if I can do this.
You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki.
Knock knock.
Oh, just like the President.
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
Are you going to kill her?
What happens now?
You must share with us. -- EMPEROR The Atreides house is building a secret army!... using a technique unknown to us... a technique involving sound. The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice... thus replacing their enemies the Harkonnens.... House Atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides... I have promised the Baron five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops.
Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
This is a Harkonnen animal.  Let me, please, my Lord.
Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?... -- JESSICA Calm yourself/
You have strength... real strength... You shall be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar.  This is your secret name in our troop.  But you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly.
It burns.
 I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
Say, that's a funny place to sleep.
Who are you?  What do you want?
Really?
I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine.
Eh, forget it.  What else is big?  Teenagers!  Jailbait pics!  Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
Those bastards at Universal.  I made so much money for them, and now I can't get the time of day.
Ha-ha!  Dr. Acula!
No!  <u>Doctor Acula</u>!  You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor!  Not a count.
Is there anything I can get you? Water?  A blanket?
"Greetings.  I am the Count."
Bela, don't worry.  You're better than all this crap.
Bela, are you ready?
It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.
I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
Last night was quite a romp.
And, CUT!  PRINT IT!  LET'S MOVE ON!
Edward Wood, Sir.
Incidentally, you <u>promise</u> you're not going to scratch my car...?
Eddie, I don't understand.  Why are <u>you</u> the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?
No!  He's very alive.  Well... sort of.  He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi!  And he's really nice.
It's a shame.  He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.
Ed, I'm so proud!  I'll read it as soon as I get home.
And what about this so-called "Barbara" character?  It's obviously ME!  I'm so embarrassed!  This is <u>our</u> <u>life</u>!
Look on the bright side.  If we miss the rent, what's the worst they can do?
All I wanna do is tell stories.  The things I find interesting...
It was the only way I could get the movie made!
But there's plenty of other parts.
That's right...
That's Tony McCoy.  He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.
But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
Dolores, wait!
For this one, we need $60,000.
Perhaps you'd like to look at the photoplay.
Sorry to bother you while we're shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money.
Mr. Wood?!
I don't know... this is all a lot to absorb.
Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
I think you're quite handsome.
No.  She tink Lobo is waste of my time.  Lobo don't talk.
Tor, dialogue is overrated.  You look at the classic film actors, who are they?  Fairbanks.  Chaplin.  They didn't talk!  They did it all with their face.
And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
Nah, I'm all man.  I even fought in WW2.  'Course, I <u>was</u> wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.
And this is why you think you're the most qualified to make my movie?
What if I told you you could have a star for $1000??
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
The marriage already ended.
How long's he been here?
Oh, it's you again.
You look beat.
Oh, flowers!  I didn't know you were so traditional.
Kathy, I'm about to tell you something I've never told any girl on a first date.  But I think it's important that you know.  I like to wear women's clothes.
Those assholes.
I know what <u>that's</u> like.  Anyway, I brought a copy of the script.  You would play the "Ghoul's Wife."
The set doesn't look right!  It looks too... empty.  Clutter it up.  Put a skeleton in the corner.  And what's that thing over there?
Just like I always promised.  Now you're among the immortals.  You're movie stars.
You're sure this is gonna work?
Too tall... too short...  And this guy doesn't work at all.
Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
What the heck is THIS?!!
What if I'm vomiting?
I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --
She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
They celebrated the common person.
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
Yeah.
Great line.
Ed, do you want my advice?
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
Mr. Pekurny.
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
Just wait here. She's coming right back out.
Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
Al!
You know who we are?
So he killed himself.
I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy.
Yes.
Both.
What's the difference?
Who?
Eddie...
St. Joseph's.
Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
What is she, at work?
What does this mean?
Um, yeah, I was gonna ...
Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
Hey, Lou.
Yeah...
Are you sure about this?
Why do it?
So?
Oh my God.
Really?
Oh God, this is so weird.
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
There's a list.
I feel like a criminal or, like we're cheating on someone.
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?!
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
You see how people look at me. Like when they ask for my autograph or say "Hi" to me... It's like I'm a basketball player or a... you know, like I'm someone.
You know, that would be like a great thing.
Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business.
I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama! ... Bedwetter!
Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia?
I mean my question is what was she doing in a bar in the first place?
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
No -- keep it.
Hello.
Hi.
I'm Jill. I really like your show. I think you're great.
Ohhh...
Look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this?
Look, my life is not so great, that I want it shown on television. And neither is yours.
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met.  I mean, you're the real thing.  Special.
Having a problem with your eye there?
You're kidding, right?
Tracy.
Looks good to me.
Thanks for everything.
Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.
You know, Mr. M., when I win the presidency, that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year.  And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you?
A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.
Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications.  I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down.  Did I do that too?
Act surprised. Walk slowly to the podium.  Be modest.  Thank them for this incredible honor.
Hello, Mr. M.
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
Handles pretty good, don't you think?
So Tracy?
I hope so
That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that.  She's finished, you hear me? Washed up.
Well, that speech she gave -- it was pretty, you know, pretty out there.  But we'll get to the bottom of it.  Don't you worry. Mr. McAllister is going to see to that.  Right, Jim?
Life would go on, and I would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience.
Hmm?
Okay.  But is this about the posters?
Which door?
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
Yep.
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was apples.  Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy.
And on Halloween we could have a haunted house.  But a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones.  You know, more like the radio station ones.  This one would be really scary.  And for Homecoming -- well, you know how last year's theme was -
Just one more thing.  So, Mr. M., uh, do you think Tracy's going to be okay? I saw her face after the assembly, and I think she's taking it pretty hard.
Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy.
Are you crazy?
People can see this.
But other people can see them too.
We can't both run, can we?  We're brother and sister.  Can we?
Thought what?
Yes, Paul?
Merry Christmas.
Somebody hit you?
Can I get you a drink?
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean?
We talked.
In the morning.
Dudley, what do you want?
<u>What do you want</u>?
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
How what, Wendell?
Give me one minute.
You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell.  You're not your old, cruel self anymore.  I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp.
Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White with the L.A.P.D.  I'd like to ask a couple of questions.
We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
Dudley's guys.
Pierce Patchett figures in, too. That's the angle Jack was working. Dudley must work for Patchett.
You figured this was a set-up? And you showed up anyway?
I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come?
That's right.
Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.
Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
Meeks is probably in Rio or someplace like that by now.
Whose shoe?
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
I want to know who we give the public in contrast?  The department needs role models. Clean-cut, <u>forthright</u> men the public can admire.
Jack Vincennes.  He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir.  He lives for it. That's the way to get him.
I got the rap sheets on the black guys, sir.  Coates and Jones got charges a mile long.  But except for some kid stuff, Fontaine's clean.
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
And?
Dudley, we've been over this.
Stensland's a disgrace.  Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under.  But White is a valuable officer.
Yes, I do, sir.
Ed, I want confessions.
No... Where'd the tip come from?
Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  Through his whore girl friend.  I sent him to make the buy.  The rest is history.
A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.
Part of it has to do with a murder.  I've been working with Ed Exley on it.
Have you discussed this with anyone else, John?
Damnit... <u>What</u>?
Is there more to that, or do I have to guess?
She is Lana Turner.
Decorated?
The Nite Owl.  Anything bothering you about the case?
I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.
Lynn Bracken.
No.
Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?  He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results.  But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down.
I'm curious about you.
It galls you that I know so much about you.  You don't have information to compete.
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake.
My daughter was a virgin!
Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
Really?  How?
What happened?
I'll come straight there.
It is?
Jesus!
The NSA killed him.
Think we let out enough air?
Fuckin-A.
These guys are incredibly persistent.
Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
What if <u>what</u>?
How?
What do you know about locking cellular phone signals?
He came in four minutes ago.
Jerry's on vacation 'till Monday. I can give him the message when he gets back. That was Patrick and the last name--
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but--
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
With spy satellites. I don't like saying these things Senator...
Hi, Mr. Dean.
Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?
It's a little late for that.
I'll be right back.
Remain calm.
For that matter, I think you will too.
About the accident.
Did he give you anything?
I don't know what's goin' on with Zavitz, but that was way, <u>way</u> outa line.  You understand?
So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?
Have you been working with Rachel?
I don't understand why Jerry couldn't clear this up.
You <u>swore</u>!
Oh, please--
I think you should leave now, Robert.
Stacy, don't hang up.
I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
The lingerie.
...who root through...uh...presents, and...
They're saying you killed that policeman.
It's really over?
I'm sorry, sir, this card's been declined.
What can I do for you?
You don't know who the fuck--
You're goddam right you jumped the gun.
How's the trout?
It is fish.
DePinto?
Brill?
Why would I--
I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.
I know.
That's temporary.
I don't <u>have</u> a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
You're a moron, you know that?
You're wrong.
Diane, maybe you didn't hear Mr. Silverberg. They've got models that'll try on the garments.  Thank you, sir.
Well until we find, you're gonna have to take a leave of absence.
Last night, Larry Spinks, he works the Steel Press, he goes to a bar with his wife Rosalie to have a glass of chianti 'cause it's his birthday, and these two guys, these Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.
He's kidding.
Jerry--
The NSA's doing this 'cause they think I have something. And they killed--
Yes.
They're framing me.
Jerry--
Go to 'em, Jerry.
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
What is it you want?
Well we'd sure like to help you.
What's your opinion?
Who?
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
Yes sir.
We're not stupid, Reynolds.
Thank you.
I can't sing.  but I can tell a story.  I might need a prompt.  Do you have your Herodotus?  I've noticed you carry it
How much did you pay?
Actually, you sing.
You should come into the shelter.
What am I looking at?
This is not very good, is it?
Shall we be all right?
Water?  Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical.  Come on, come on!  There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
Do they know them?
What do you hate most?
Say you're sick.
It's beautiful.  What's it about?
Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!
Madox knows, I think.  He's tried to warn me.  He keeps talking about Anna Karenina.  I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat.  Its my idea of a man-to-man chat.
What?  What?  That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?
I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there?  How can you ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?
Dance with me.
You're wearing the thimble.
It's so cold.
Oh dear.
A broken car?
Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
Very well.
Oops!  Mustn't say International. Dirty word.  Filthy word.  His Majesty! Die Fhrer!  Il Duce.
Do you have your papers, sir?
What did you do?
And I'm telling you there's nothing there to explore.
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
Why do they care about our maps?
Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow.  I'm going to do what I can, but  And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything.  Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.
How are you?
It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41. And so was this - August 41.  And this -February 42.
Yeah, for a while.
I could help you.  I could get you off that.
Where did you find that?
Thought you'd never wake up!
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
Why do you think?  About my staying?
Marvelous plane.  Did you look?
I will hide you in the room where we sleep, said Candaules. She stumbles over the word.
Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds.  As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room.  I can smell it.  The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth.  I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint.  Is there sand in my eyes?  Are you cleaning sand from my ears?
I can see my wife in that view.
Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door.
I see.  Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach.  He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
What do I do?
I was thinking yesterday - yesterday! - the Patient, Hardy: they're everything that's good about England. I couldn't even say what that was. We didn't exchange two personal words, and we've been together through some terrible things, some -  he was engaged to a girl in the village! - I mean -  and us - he never once He didn't ask me if I could spin the ball at cricket or the kamasutra or - I don't even know what I'm talking about.
If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?
The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
You've got a mustache.
You've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last.
Yessir.
Certainly not.
You should sit down, darling.  She's quite all right.  Are you pregnant?
No.
You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
So he popped the pane?
They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now?
I've got something for you.
And I thought we were getting on so well.
Very nice.
Fine. What do I do?
It's a fake.
A film case.
What the hell was that?
What about your bags?
That's entrapment.
And good morning.
Nice spot.
We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside?
Don't worry, I can get rid of this. No trace. And I'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we?
Why don't we take oxygen?
Let's do it again.
Did I hear a car?
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
Thank you.
You're nervous again.
He wasn't.
We're working.
Can you see the other PIRs?
You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in.
Okay, you're a thief.
Your share.
You've got everything planned.
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
What about the rules?
It's taken me five years at Webber Insurance, nights, weekends, every spare minute, to make this CD. It has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts, two, or three million at a crack. Total, eight billion and change.
That's where the Mask comes in.
There's always a surprise.
How do I look?
Not for me.
Don't panic, now, there's no rush...
Put this on!
Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.
You have the right to remain silent. But anything you say may be taken down in evidence and used against you--
--You're a cop.
They work off the O2 tank just like the slice pack.
We might not want to cash in our chips just yet. She has another job after this one. A big one.
You look like George Washington.
You better not be taking on a new partner.
Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter.
Tonight your league night?
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
Thirty-five next generation microchips. Copper, not silicon. Value: one million each.
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
My friend, you always surprise me.
His dry cleaners.  You want him?
What's she doing here?
There's more than one?
What?  Hey -- <u>he</u> hit <u>me</u>.
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
How does someone get meningitis?
Hi.  Donna Irving?
I know.  They're more than a bit unusual. See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's disease.  That's a kind of cancer --
So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick.
They took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now.
Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
I didn't see any medical records in there.
This is the only thing you found?
I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed that send button -- PG&E claims department is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting.
How many families we talking about here?
I like this case.
If they've sent that little shmuck Baum again, I'm gonna be real pissed off.
Jesus.  They look like the Secret Service.
What kind of truck?
He's gone.  Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?
Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
She insulted me!
Because <u>that's how people treat each other</u>!
How dare you take that away from me.
If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.
Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They need their money now!  We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --
I wasn't gonna --
Ed, I swear, I'm not --
How many counts?
I was working in the compressor, and out of nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the office and says, we're gonna give you a shredder machine, and send you on down to the warehouse.  We want you to get rid of all the documents stored out there.
Nope.  And I didn't ask.
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look.
Ross.
So that stuff -- it kills people.
Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.
Hey, Erin, I thought you were taking a sick day.
Randy's mom said yes right away.
Excuse me -- Theresa, was it?  There are no holes in my research.
You want my number?
I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
Great.  Another deadbeat.
What're you doing?
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?
About this.
They up?
How long's this whole thing gonna take?
It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.
Someone stole my stuff.
-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here.
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
Who's Baxter?
They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And these guys -- Donna and Peter --
... and when I realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too.  So I went and asked.
He'll learn.
Luke, use The Force only for knowledge and for defense, not as a weapon.  Don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke nods and climbs back into his ship.
We should have stayed and finished them off.
Barks his consternation.
Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.
... Like we're being watched.
Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.
I have felt it.
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
Not you?
Well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer.
I don't know what he's talking about.
That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
There's something out there!
I see it Chewie, hang on.
Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
I was worried about you.
About what?
Get out of here, Lando!
What's going on?
You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.
Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
Rather touchy, aren't they.
Okay.  I'll give it a try.
Me, too.  Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse.  Have we fed them?  Like raw steak or something?
Nobody's going to believe it.
Go easy, Stevie.
We shall want a full autopsy ...
Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how.
Ooww!
You're about to get hit, Cuervo. It's Plissken.
I thought he was, but he came back.
Wait a minute. I know that voice.  You're Carjack Malone.
I was called away on urgent business, Snake.
So what's the deal, gorgeous?
She's overloaded! We're too heavy.
I think we've burned off enough fuel. We may be lighter enough to hover. Just barely.
How you doin' Plissken?  You like the watch?
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
Get this crap out of me.
Defense against what?
I said pull over.
Where is it?
Me too?
What are they?
This is a dead end.  You took us into a dead end!
What are you gonna do in Venice?
I can see you're real concerned about your daughter.
You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.
The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
But your life and lands are far from here.
These men repented before God for their evil deeds. Those who would not, met their fate at the end of my sword.  Accept the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift.
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
Who is Merlin?
How? Where?
A king must marry, after all.
I love her. If she would be my queen, my dreams would be answered.
I am alone and betrayed. By my wife, by my beloved friend, by my knights. And by you. Perhaps most of all by you. For you made me, you forged this wretched life. And like a child tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a babbling lecher trotting after my sister...
But, I'm here.
Sir... Kay needed a sword. His was stolen. I saw Excalibur, and... I took it.
But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores...
And you cannot love me...
I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.
Me?
The law forbids it.
I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
It's clear you are, and it irks me.
You are truly magnificent!
--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
Behold the sword of power, Excalibur. Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to Thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow.  Speak the words.
Burke take a look at this damn thing it just doesn't make sense.
No, he's working on another book.
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.
It might be best to have a man with experience. Maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
I'm sorry.
Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes.  Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.
Does your daughter remember if perhaps Mr. Dennings was in her room in her room that night?
May I ask...?
Groceries maybe? A package?
Morning.
A stimulant.
The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.
Did he tell you about my party?
On what?
Oh yeah, since when?
No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-
Did you know my mother died recently?
Where's Regan's father?
Hey, where'd this come from?
You really don't want me to play huh?
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
Mother please! Oh please mother make it stop! It's burning, it's burning please mother!
Hi Chris. Great party.
She doesn't remeber a thing.
Pathological states can induce abnormal strength, accelerated motor performance. For example, a ninety-pound women sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck, runs out and lifts the wheels half a foot up off the ground. You know the story, same thing here. Same principle, I mean.
There haven't been more than a hundred authenticated cases of so- called split personality, Mrs. MacNeil. Now I know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry, but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first.
A pneumoencephelogram, I would think, pin down that lesion. It will involve another spinal.
Do you like films?
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
You and Regan?
Do it again.
Quod nomen mihi est?
Ydob eht ni mraw si ti! Uoy ees I! Tseirp a si eh! Emit su evig! Nirrem! Nirrem!
I'm all right.
Your Uncle John stopped by to visit me.
Dimmy, you worry for something?
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
No.
Shut up!!
Hey, Father? You like movies?
I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.
Your mother sucks cocks in hell Karras, you faithless slime!
Is there someone inside you?
No.
What about tomorrow?
Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
Trunks?
What's wrong with them?
What do you do to him?
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
Piano.
My brother and I. One each.
What do you say we go for a walk, pal.
Oh my God ...
I thought these were lost. Where did you find ...
When they coming in?
Tag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown, Thursday-Friday.  Thanks.
Jack.
What's wrong with it?
That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack?
You mind telling me what that was about in there? Was that planned? Or were you just bored and decided to get creative?
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.
Seeing anyone in particular?
Yeah?
Frank?
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
No?
Jack.
What are you, crazy?
Get out of here.
Oh, brother.
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
I figure that way we won't get confused.
We're gonna be here a week?
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
How long you been at it?
Funny, huh?
You saw wrong.
A useless talent.
God, the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he?
Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
That takes care of this week.  The tenth we got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the Capri.
What're you doing?
Cancel, Frank.
Nothing. We get nothing.
What's it for?
What-are you?  A fucking moron? It's three o'clock in the morning, Frank.  Who's watching?  Your wife? Maybe you can get us a gig playing Little Frank's birthday party. What do you think?
Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.
What?
Stay off it.
Looks like these got a few years on them.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?
Christ, that's right.  How could I forget.  What a nightmare.
A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half block down.  You wait here.
Susie.  Susie Diamond.
When?
Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.  Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.
I wear a seven.
Nine!
They're tight.
The switch.  Hit the switch.
Virgins?
Peggy Lee?
What'd she sing?
Oh yeah?
Decency?  Hey listen, pal ...
Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...
Yes, sir.  That's quite a girl you boys latched onto.  She a local?
How come?
All right.  Hold on.
Save it.  What's he look like?
Hey, he's not sore, is he?
Where's egghead?
Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well, au revoir.
You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.
So why's he do it?
Can't sleep?
Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.
Relax.  We'll drop the song.
I can keep the beat.
You're upset.
Nina?
She's four feet tall.  Ed?
Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.
My father proposed to my mother in there.
I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.
Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.
I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
From Hurley's?
Do I look wasted -- asshole?
Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
Perfect fit.
Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge.
Or reactivated the first one.
Do you know what it is to be in a coma?  It fucks up everything -- including your memory! I can't even tell you why Dobbs jumped me yesterday!
I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
... I was dreaming ...
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
How did he expect to do that?
He freaked out when he thought I had seen this stuff.  I think it's a list of cities -- Santiago, Ho Chi Minh City, Nandi ...
You can't go.  You can't be anywhere near that place.
We can send in a plant -- try to get Pollux to spill the location.
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
Jamie ...
Just saving the tax-payers the cost of a trial.  So take a hike.
Screw your boundaries, Janie.  You have something I want.
Kim?
You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off!
What happened?
You're both in custody until there's a DNA fingerprinting and we can prove who's who. Now put the gun down.
-- I'll be one of the most powerful men in the country. Didn't matter how much cash I made pulling wet jobs -- I was still too low on the food chain -- always with somebody like Jon Archer after me.  The best part is -- I'm the GOOD guy.
I'm just having some fun.
What is with you tonight?
... That's great.
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
Nothing.
Where's Jamie?
I'll deal with her later.
I'm going to the powder room.
Oh, and Oxxford called...
Hello?
Do you like kids?
You know how to make chocolate milk?
This is day care.  Its where babies go when their parents are at work.
What am I saying?  You dont need to hear that...  All I meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, thats all.  Is that you?
Damn...
Wheres your follow through?  Wheres your stance?
She said that?
I dont care if youre Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still cant park here.
Howd you know my name?
Yes you do...
I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...
Yeah?  What do you need?
Miss me, Jack?
Look, I dont know what youre getting so worked up about, you did this...you brought this on yourself.
No?  Cmon, Jack...Ive got everything I need, I dont have regrets, thats just not for me... sound familiar?
Everyone else in that store is a statue, they see their lives passing in front of their eyes, but not you.  Youre making a business deal...
Ive got kids, Im going home...
What're you talkin' about?
Mushroom puffs arent the only thing I do well...
Are we finally being honest?
Do I have a private office somewhere in the building?
...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did you know that?
Kates on two, Jack.  Nice ride...
About four grand.  And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D.  Im putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
What kind of man does that!?
Where were you?
Jack...dont even start...
Christ...  Where the hell is the bathroom?
Jack...
Shes your dog, Jack.
Hey!  I was watching that!
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
Good, Jack.  Maybe well keep her.
How was the game, honey?
Thank you...
Not it...?
My god, all this time...I never stopped loving you...
This place is a perk, Kate.
Annie goes to a great school.
Dont do that...
To Paris. Paris, France.
Dont do this, Jack... But he continues...
Its because Im shy, Betty.  So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?
No...
Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.  An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...
Damn...damn...damn...
Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
I had it at four.
Isn't that <u>your</u> speech?
The shields on the station should protect us.
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
Are you alright?
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
No more cracks about how I look.
I'll be watching over you.
Ben, come in.
He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
He's not responsive --
This is wrong in so many ways.
He's right.  These costumes are... missing something.  I can't put my finger on it --
Me like-y.
Stop it.
What is that <i>thing</i>?
Wait.  You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
Leonard, how's the feed?
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
<u>Ben</u> did this?
I, uh, think I remember the number.
For science.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  Can you remember the exact emotions when --
I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?
Which is why I'm working <u>twenty</u> hours a day, checking every variable --
It's just business.
Victor, I'm sorry I --
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Victor, wait, slow down a second.  I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us <u>worse</u>, maybe even kill us.
Grant's uniquely qualified for this mission. He's a Communications Expert and was a Frogman during the War. Besides, he brought Benes into this country, and the fewer people who know about him, the better. At any rate, you'll find Grant invaluable, should anything go wrong once you're under way.  Okay, Don.
Hello, Grant. Good to see you again.
How bad off is he?
-- and why we need you.
I can't even put a Band-Aid on my finger.
Wish I knew why.
His technician okay? In addition to the Looks Department?
If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
Yes, Alan.
That's beside the point now.  I don't see the sense of going on.
Air bubbles!... Doctor --
He's making a fine recovery.
No need to get up --
You're not the first, but he's much too innocent, much too involved with his work, to realize what's going on around him.
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
What do you mean?
I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final!
The Soul? The finite mind cannot comprehend Infinity. And the Soul which comes from God is Infinite.
Removal Point? What're you talking about!
Don't tell me they're refueling...
Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.
"Yet all the suns that light the Corridors of the Universe shine dim, Before the blazing of a Single Thought -- "
Doctor, we've just about had it.
Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant.
About forty miles an hour.
A what?
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
Looks like the sea, at dawn.
We're entering the Lymphatic System. Those are nuclei of cells, lining a Duct.
They're tracking us Topside. Once they see where we're going, I'm sure they'll take every precaution.
May I?
Out of your element, aren't you, Captain?
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
Doctor -- the channel's getting awful narrow.
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you?
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
Can I see your license and registration please?
Ya find the work interesting, do ya?
...So I guess that's it, then.  Here's the keys -
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
Oh, don't be silly.
Well, Ecklund & Swedlin's, that's closer ta Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.
Just a general way.
The numbers y'asked for, calls made from the lobby pay phone at the Blue Ox. Two to Minneapolis that night.
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
Uh-huh.
You're not a C student.
What's the next step here, Jerry?
Wade's got a point there. I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry.
You wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda busy -
Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering -
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
Yah, real good.
Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?
Yah!  I... those are in the mail.
Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.
Stan Grossman called.
Twice.
...Is everything okay?
Yah, you said you'd have a think about it. I understand it's a lot of money -
Yah.
A million dollars is a lot a damn money! And there they are, they got my daughter!
Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?
Hiya, Lou.
Yah, thanks a bunch. So what's the deal, now? Gary says triple homicide?
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
Yah, that's a good one.
Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
Geez! You look great!
...What can I get ya?
...This is a nice place.
Well, I always liked you, Mike.
...I'm sorry... I shouldn't a done this... I thought we'd have a really terrific time, and now I've...
Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
Linda Cooksey?
So... they didn't...
Oh. Geez.
Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
...How's the paintin' goin'?
Yeah, couple a muskies. No pike yet. How d'you feel?
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.
That wouldn't interest you.
This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.  The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob.
Let's pretend.  You're the Department of Transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects?  Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles.  Fuel injectors that burn people alive.
I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
The dynamite...
Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me.  The dishes were me.  The plants were...
I'm in pain.
We need to talk.
Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?
It's for men.
I'm just on my way out...
You... don't have to... leave.
Guy or girl?
The Paper Street Soap Company.
Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
You have to get out of here.  Leave as soon as possible.  Go to any rural town, away from any major city...
What happened... ?
Who did this to you?
Is this a test, sir?
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
I had everything in that bag.  My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.  Marla...the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it, but you can't.
Can I stay at your place?
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.
Okay... Ghandi.
You get rid of her.
Stop it.  This is your pain -- your burning hand.  It's right here.  Look at it.
Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
There's fight club in Delaware City.
Tyler...
Something on your mind?
Is this a needlepoint club?  Is it about you and me?
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.  We are all part of the same compost heap...
What the hell ... ?!
Why do you think I blew up your condo?
"Too young?"
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  Now look what you've done!
The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
Can't you call it off... ?
From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart...
Do something for me.
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
His name is Robert Paulson!
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
Would you rather be dead?
Yeah, how?
The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. That was Death's original design.
That's good.  Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes.  For the signs.
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
What did you see?
Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.
Jury duty?  That's randomly selected by social security numbers.
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again.  Did you?
Look, you weren't there.  It was weird.  She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident, she knew.  Never mind.
Please.  It's not going to wait.
May we come in?
Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. They asked me what number means "good luck" in Jewish.
Here's what I don't get.  For nine months, Death does all this shit to make sure I win these tickets and end up on Route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up...
Billboards about accidents.  Kids yelling "pile up" for no reason. It all felt...just wrong. Just like... 
I know.  I've gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp. We're all meeting at my apartment tonight.
This is cheery.
Kalarjian?
But it's over.  Isabella's baby was the key.  You saw her die and everything, right?
Welcome back.  We did it.  For real.
This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?
Relax, you need to chill the fuck out.
Can I ask you a question?
Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.
Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
It's only the end of June.
How many died on Flight 180?  From our group?
I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me.
Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
You know what to do.
Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?
You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next. That's the only pattern. You should be dead.
I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father...
... there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps.  And no... escapes.
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
... to target at Ban Kia Na.  We probe the site...
That's what I'm here for.
What's this?
You fucking crazy?  I need it to burn these things off.
What's this stuff on the rice?
Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
What's she saying?
These guys look like they'd sell their mothers.
Snoring.  Five, six guys. Mumbling... Vietnamese.  Somebody talking in his sleep.  A toilet flushing.
I'm getting him out.
Can you handle the door gun?
You really got a Masters Degree?
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
Are you okay?
Christ.  How'd you get here?
Where?
I didn't know you were a stick man, Rambo.
You think they'll find any?
What's up?
Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
...SO...anybody special in your life?
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
I can't tell you how distraught I was.  All night long.  What the hell happened?
... So... where did you sleep last night?
Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
No.
Parry?
Yeah, well... I let him stay there. What else could I do after such a tragedy?
No...no...we can't...we can't..
Isn't that awful? Poor Brenda Frazier. Poor Little Gloria. They ruined them! THEY ATE THEM ALIVE!
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
Huh-huh.
You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.
Free?
Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...
Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in...
Have I died?
... I've got a right to say something.  I mean, you're tying my hands here!  They say you're not ready to know.
Thanks... You can keep the doll.
Here's another twenty. Will that do?  I mean, what's it going to take!
That's O.K.
Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
Parry...
I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.
Parry Parry?
How do you know him?
What are we about to do?
My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
Cerveza.
So how long am I supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?
Rayette.
Bobby...
Sure you don't want anything?
I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?
Well...
Can I get you anything else?
No. We have tomatoes.
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
I'm gonna give you our number, Donnie, just in case...  We're both professionals, if you didn't guess.
Robert Eroica...
Sorry.
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that you're coming...
Well, I really appreciate it, Carl.
He has ways of communicating, Robert. I can tell when he's expressing approval or disapproval, just from his eyes...
What questions?
Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
You're leaving?
Bye, now.
Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
You had no inner feeling?
Wait...
Serious, that's what's important to you?
I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
I'm sorry everything's been so confusing, but I have to go, Robert...
That's three games to none, Carl.
Oh, no. You're more than welcome.
Oh no, it's been much more than that.
I don't think that's true.
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...
There'd never be a hole big enough. Now took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, I was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all...
And you know, I read where they invented this car that runs on... that runs on... when you boil water...
If you want to call it that.
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
What?
Remember me, from the pool?
Whadja wanna see me about?
So wadda you do with your girls?
So what you think of me?
Come down!
Who gives!
Fa what?
They are?
Where you goin'?
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
Yo, remember from the pool, that girl?
The one with the phat ass?
Yo! What you goin' for
You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair.
You sure?
My friend told me she lived around here.
You live around here?
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
Would you like me to change anything?
What?
I wasn't asking.
Hey, what are you doing?
You can't keep me here.
This one's going to be even more fun.
So where do you know Alan from?
Two bs?
No children?
Right.
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
So what do you figure?
No idea at all?
What, the heat here?
You gonna nail the chief?
You're in the Records Room.
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.
Why don't you check it out for yourself, Mr. Nugent?
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attach cases.
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.
They busted me last week.
Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
Where does the Chief get the drugs?
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
That's Brazil.
Because we can't.
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that.
Why don't you try suicide?
So why pick me?
Maybe I'm just on vacation.
I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy.
So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.
LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you.
Will you kill me?
Only if you promise not to return me.
'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
I bet you do.
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
What's he doing in Utah?
You were in the war?
Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
So?
He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me.
No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...
What are you talking about?
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
What did you want under the bed?
I never read the paper.
How gray?
More cops.  I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank.
I was upset.
Mrs. Stanwyk!
But I ain't got you...
No, I ain't got you...
Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
Ah, the Dorothy Chandler.  I was just there with my good friend Art Mooney the other night...
Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
You're saying you need money.
Hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits.  This one is putting out low bits.  The data is in some fucked binary system.  The two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc.  Comprendo?
Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s.  Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
Suck a dick, I left my purse...
Ick.
I can't kill this kid's father...
Are you okay?
So, Zuzu.  Are you okay?
Gut feeling.
Who cares?  I got a case.
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
I tried to help you...!
Yeah, go on...
I need someone to help me with my case load, you interested?  This whole father/son thing, if you're not into it, I mean, it's okay. You know what I'm saying?
Nice tie, Lt. Anus, sir.
You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!
I want you to say that you're the biggest sissy in the whole wide world.
How could Grendel Records sign such a wick-prick?  I guess Julian Grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob.  I hear Ray Charles is going to head up the video division.
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
It doesn't have to be like this?
I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?
When I say 'no,' run for the door.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.
You're that guy, the private eye.
I don't believe it.  Getting paid to be the asshole you always were.
I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
What?
Where are you?
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
What's your name, asshole?
Henri c'est gentil d'tre venu.  Je vous prsente mon associ, Pierre Nicoli.  Henri Devereaux.
Did they follow you?
Tu sais j'ai rflchi longuement  ton cadeau pour le voyage.  Je l'ai choisi moi-mme.  Tiens.
Regarde, il te va parfaitement bien!
Une erreur!  C'est gnial.  C'est une vedette  la tlvision.  Il peut aller partout sans tre souponn... En plus il a besoin de fric.
If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.
What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin' from the cops?
Why not?
Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb guinea.
Never trust a nigger.
Let's popeye around the Chez for a half hour, catch the end of the show and a couple drinks.
I make at least two junk connections at that table in the corner.  The guy is the stripe combo, I know him too.
We got information that there's no shit in the street -- it's like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming in to make everybody well.
What happened to you?
What about Sal?
My ass.  The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers.
Pass.
I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.
It was a crematorium.
What am I, a shmuck?  What's the hurry?  He could see a couple of shows and visit the top of the Empire State Building.
No, I don't.
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
Why haven't they killed the juice?
Oh, yeah.  Damn.  My watch is busted.
How about a little of the King?
How was your tour?
Butch called.
You give him his drops?
Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years!  Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!
Lucky throw, fire boy.
What is going on here, Satch?  What are those guys doing out there?
No, I don't.
About what?
In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.
You missed a hell of a game, Frank.
Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief.
What?
I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it?
What'd you say your name was?
29 years...?
Oh my god.
Yeah, that's how Hams work.
When?
We're doing all right, Dad.  We're doing good.
What?  What is it?
Murdered?  Why?
Whatta you mean...
How?
Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?
John, say hello to my wife...Julia.
This is wrong...it's like we cheated...
I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this.
His prints.  You've got his prints.  I'll run them through criminal index.  You gotta get me that wallet.
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
Wait.  Something's wrong.  I don't...
Sull!  What the hell!
Go in where?
My father didn't die in a fire?
What?
Hi, this is Julia.  Please leave a message after the tone.
I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
So how'd you like LION KING?
I look familiar?
Who the fuck is this?
Going?  How do you mean?
No more... I can't!
How about you and I whacking a couple of balls around?
What're you doin'?
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
I'm a slow eater.
What are they saying?
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
You haven't changed a bit.  Always so sure of yourself.  Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.
I don't know.
No.  I got here just before you did.
Shelly!  Where are you?!
When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  I was so upset... I told them I slept with you.  My mothers slapped me.  That was the first time she'd ever hit me.  I couldn't believe it.  I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying.  They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that.  I decided to hide out all night.  They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me.  The woods were cold and damp from the rain.  I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep.  All I can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  I thought it was my father so I hid behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark.  I couldn't see anything.  I heard a cracking noise behind me.  I turned around and... and... oh, God... there was this hideous looking man.  So grotesque he was almost inhuman.  He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away.  I ran and ran, but he kept coming.  He was big but so fast.  He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me?  Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  I was kicking and yelling.  He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  Oh, please... please...
What d'ya got in there?
Vera... you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today.  I like you... very much.  I was thinking that maybe.
You've just learned a valuable lesson.  A beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone.
You don't "have to."
That's it.  Pull over.  I'm drivin'.
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
Don't worry about it.  Just stay cool.
Is that all you found?
....with a woman's touch.
Come on, you guys!  The game's over!!
Never should've let her play.
I thought Jason was only a legend?
They did show up.  Isn't that great?
Where'd you get this?
You know what?  Sissy and Cort are playing jokes.  You know, trying to scare each other.
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
I can't believe no one called back.  I better...
Which is?
Why not?  I used to play it alone. I love murder games.  Have you ever played The Consulting Detective?
Now you better cool out a minute, boy.  You already almost got your head blown to pieces.
Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were....
Jason Voorhees is dead.
Legs giving you trouble?
Maybe you should be moving on.
She's beautiful.
What are you doing?
Wanna know how I did that?
Don't do anything stupid.
Oh, my dear God...
I've told you the truth.
You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
No thanks.
What's wrong?
What murders?
Right.
And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
Jason's here in New York.
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
What are you doing??
What did you do with Rennie??
He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake.
I...I can't...
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
You had me worried to death!
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
I've got the numbers.
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...
I didn't mean for you to go!
We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case.
Rennie...what'd they do to you??
You have to call the police...
Under the Manhattan Bridge.
Don't talk like that.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
Tonight. What's tonight?
I think we Nought to wait.
We were thinking of putting in a pool.
Does it feel comfortable?
What about her?
You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
We're able to surprise each other.
I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.
Opening night?
Will I believe you when you tell me something?
I'm willing to tell you my name.
See, Daddy.
Your father said you might be here.
You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
Alma Wetzel.
You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
Some little kid stole the hubcaps.
Now that's a complicated subject.
You see what you're doing, don't you?
You're charming the boy.
It's a complicated subject.
This is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. Very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see, Matthew. The Red Sox win a World Series. This is deeply, intensely personal. All the mistakes I've made, all the envy, fear and violence that's encased in this little envelope we call a person -- all washed away in the next few minutes. And your grandmother knows why.
All the times I died when the Red Sox lost an important game they should have won. All the awful things I said to my mother and father. To Tmy wife and daughter.
Then they lost?
They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm Steven. My parents are divorced.'
I was six years old the day Pesky hesitated throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first. That's when I knew the Red Sox were my team. Pity and terror.
aybe we ought to postpone the opening.
And the Father replies?
This could be it.
So does Elliot.
Endearing.
You know what.
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them.
It is the work of untouchables.
You really are going to Pakistan, then?  You are a stubborn man.
You'd be Gandhi --  ...I thought you'd be bigger.
You're a clergyman.
If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them.
What was he like?
What'd he say?
I'll take your luggage back, baas.
We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.
Fortunately such news comes very slowly where I live.
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
Is it over if they arrest you now?
After what they did at the massacre -- it's only an eye for an eye.
In England, I was a poor student but I --
The fools!  Sorry...
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
All right. Fine.
In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan.
There are a few million miles to go yet.
Well?  You have all the answers.  How is that possible?
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes. The Director was not...  ...universally loved.  He was leading the cut-backs in the program.  You're looking at a room full of motives.
According to this, he's a sick man.  Congenital heart condition.  Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.
What a pity.
Don't underestimate these imposters.
You know their workforce.  Two-thirds at least fall into the category.  We'll be closing down their operation for days.  At least go with a fingertip sample or urine.
From what budget?
Would you care to look--in the telescope?
Don't be deceived, Irene.  These are just the clothes.  He has to wear them. Something I could never do.
Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?
It's not too late to back out.
What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong.  How could you be so careless?
Is that all?
Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
You can wear lifts.
You're angry--
It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
So you didn't do it after all.
What's this, Lamar?
I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
What about your wife?
Hello, Doc.
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
Half a million.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
I guess I'm kind of...
$250,000 right off the top.
Why are you laughing?
Promise you won't laugh.
I feel like the night before the first day of school.
It will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more.
I mean it.
Who's she?
You've got it all figured.
From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
I trust...  Want to see what I trust... In God we trust...  The word's on every bill!!!
We're going to make it.
Look, what you said yesterday... I guess that was right. It isn't worth anything if we don't make it together.
I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him.
Sounds good.
Okay.
Can we make it?
Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.
Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
Whatever happens... we're going all the way.
Just in case someone gets a shot off.
Suit yourself.
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
Then you do it.
Don't you want to go to the airport?
Come on. How much?
Sure am.
Two years.
The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.
A couple of weeks back.
You knew what I'd do.
Five grand. It belongs to you. Along with a little name I'm going to give you.
Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
Address?
What about?
Really.
I want to talk to you later.
How were things between you and Frank?
Why'd you see him so regular?
What was bugging Frank?
It is. Honestly.
Yes. I met him last year.
Yes, while he was here.
How'd you know where I'd be?
What does he want that bloody great country place for?
And you didn't know her last name?
Look, look.  Get your suit cleaned.
How's school?
You all right now?
Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again.  There. Go and get your hair done.
Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right?
What you having, Jack?
Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine?
Did they give you a rough time?
No chance of that.
They're friends of mine.
What you going to do?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
They're still the same. Piss holes in the snow.
Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
Jack! I didn't like that.
You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you.
Scotch, please.
If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better.
Gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself.
Gerald wants to see him first.
The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great.  You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  All of them.  You go in the door.  I..."I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or I don't win the Cadillac..." We fuckin' work too hard.  You work too hard.  We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
They did.
They did.
I, I...I...
That's right?
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
Starting up.
To say "I'm going on my own." 'Cause what you do, George, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to someone else. And we enslave ourselves.  To please.  To win some fucking toaster...to...to... and the guy who got there first made up those...
He made up those rules, and we're working for him.
...you're absolutely right.
Yes.  I mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just...
As a "robbery"?!  No.
You're going to steal the leads?
A buck a shot.
However they are, that's the deal. A buck a throw.  Five thousand dollars.  Split it half and half.
What?  What?  The leads.
You...
Listen to this.  I have an alibi, I'm going to the Como Inn, why? Why?  The place gets robbed, they're going to come looking for me.  Why?  Because I probably did it.  Are you going to turn me in?  George?  Are you going to turn me in?
Are you sure?
...you don't have to come in...
Well, well, well, talk to me, we sat down to eat dinner, and here I'm a criminal...
Why?
I do?
Fine.
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
It is dead.
I am?
He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.
Why don't you think so?
Did they catch...?
Who told you...?
Moss...Who told him?
Roma!  I'm talking to you...
You have a problem?
Shelly...
...no...
...I only...
...you talk to Murray...
I've seen those leads.  I saw them when I was at Homestead, we pitched those cocksuckers Rio Rancho nineteen sixty-nine they wouldn't buy.  They couldn't buy a fucking toaster.  They're broke, John. They're cold.  They're deadbeats, you can't judge on that.  Even so. Even so.  Alright.  Fine.  Fine. Even so.  I go in, FOUR FUCKING LEADS they got their money in a sock.  They're fucking Polacks, John.  Four leads.  I close two. Two.  Fifty per...
Alright.
Now?  Now?
Well, I want to tell you something, fella, wasn't long I could pick up the phone, call Murray and I'd have your job.  You know that?  Not too long ago.  For what?  For nothing. "Mur, this new kid burns my ass." "Shelly, he's out." You're gone before I'm back from lunch.  I bought him a trip to Bermuda once...
Is that what you're saying?
That's alright.
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
What are you trying to tell me?
You said, "You don't make something up unless it's sure to help."  How did you know that I made it up?
I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
No.  It hadn't.
What'd you do with the leads?  You want to go in there?  I tell him what I know, he's going to dig up something...You got an alibi last night?  You better have one. What did you do with the leads?  If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk.
Do I have to tell you?  Moss.
I...
You did that?
"You do get the..."  Huh?  Huh?
Rick.  Let me tell you.  Wait, we're in the...
You closed 'em today?
Oh, Christ.
Ray is director of all European sales and services for American Ex...  But I'm saying you haven't had a meal until you've tasted...I was at the Lingks' last...as a matter of fact, what was that service feature you were talking about...?
"Home Cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,
Ah.  Ah, his wife is.  Ray: what time do you have...?
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
What?
I'm sorry...?
Money?  If that's what it signifies to you. Security?  Comfort?  All it is is THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO YOU.  That's all it is.  How are they different?  Some poor newly married guy gets run down by a cab.  Some busboy wins the lottery.  All it is, it's a carnival.  What's special...what draws us?  We're all different.  We're not the same.  We are not the same.  Hmmm.  It's been a long day.  What are you drinking?
Monday.
Who did she call?
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
To negotiate what?  To negotiate what?
What are the police doing?
Listen to me: They got some of them.
I don't "want" it, if you catch my drift.
Three?  I count two.
...Mr. Williamson...
Are you alright?
Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
What took so long?
Constanzia.  We expected you last week; we sent the car to pick you up at the airport last week.
I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
Deanna, will you get back into the house!
Ready, Frankie.
Mike, I got something special up my sleeve for these boys.  You ever hear of &quot;Superman?&quot; And I don't mean the comic book.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
Fredo.  Where are you going?
It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I can handle things.  I'm not dumb Christ, not like everyone says. I'm smart; and I want respect.
Why?  Why does he bother other Italians?
Beautiful.
Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.
The 'patrone' is here.
Within the compound will be fine.
Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side.
He doesn't want my help any more. He doesn't need it.
What do you mean gone?
You're going to talk to him now.
Will you tell him?
Rocco!
Me too, Tom?
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
Sit down, Tom.  Have you heard about our friend and partner, Mr. Hyman Roth?
I don't like it when you use the word impossible; nothing is impossible...
I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill...  ANYBODY.  But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't you going to tell me at all?
The High Court of Israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned Jew.' His passport's been invalidated except for return to the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday, offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship.  They turned him down.
You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should be organized, how they based it on the old Roman Legions, and called them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos' and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.
The Roman Empire... when a plot against the Emperor failed, the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes.
Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels.
...and the tape will be running.
You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
Senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record.
Anthony, Daddy's busy.
Why too late?
If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.
We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
Sit down, this is almost over.  You follow the baseball games?
What a mistake; people behaving like that, with guns.  It was my understanding we left all that behind.  But, let me tell you, the important thing is that you're all right.  Good health is the most important thing; more than success; more than power; more than money.
Why...the Rosato Brothers.
They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished.
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
The Rosatos are running crazy; taking hostages, spitting in my face, because they're backed by the Jew in Miami.
Trust me; do as I ask.
I trust these men with my life. They are my right arms; I cannot insult them by sending them away.
You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me.  That puts me and the other New York families against you.
I'm talking about Italians!
Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity.  Her rent will remain what it was.
You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.
It's different.  He's a man.  And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
You picked up that girl right in front of me.
So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
Then you're as single as I am.
Maybe.  But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
I didn't do it.  This wasn't me.
Good morning.
And your name is --?
They're just copies then.  Gotcha.
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
You went to university?
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
Did you see this?  They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night.
I'm sorry.  It's too white, too distracting.  Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders.  Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?
Dripping?  Do you ever eat dripping in this country?  The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars.  Used like butter on bread.
You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.
Do you mind?
I'll pay our going rate.  Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.
Just a trim.  And mine while you're at it.  Fingers are a bit stiff today.
Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.
So we understand each other?
Can I see what you did so far?
Sorry.  Not today.
Isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy?  Do you have to rub my nose in it?
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
Barnett.  Was that his name? Leonard Barnett.  He came to the front straight from Harrow.  And he looked up to me.  Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters.  How strange, to be admired so blindly.  I suppose he loved me.  But chastely, like a schoolboy.
Are you enjoying yourself?
I better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia.
You're much wider than I am.  You won't want to attempt to get into my pants.
That only leaves the rest.
My old man was a Marine.  He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.
Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.
I said it must be weird seeing your monsters again, and you said, "The only monsters are here."  I was wondering which here you meant.
Break my neck.  Or strangle me.  It would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me.  Please, Clayton. We've come this far.
This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times.
Can't say that I have.  Can't say I've heard of a lot of people though.
Sick stuff.  Necrophilia.  I wonder if they knew how sick they were.
Then take the pills.
I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this movie and two difficult stars --
I did.  But Princess Margaret was a doll.  We're all equals in her eyes.  As commoners, I presume.
The central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations.  Whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short-circuited this mechanism. Parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random.
Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.
I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago. She said you'd been under the weather.
We'll be in touch, Jimmy.
You remember what the doctor tells us.
She is horrible.
You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?
That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  "Bride of Frankenstein."
There was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called "Journey's End".  Every experienced director turned it down, so I offered myself, bullying and begging for the job.  "Journey's End" made the careers of everyone associated with it.  It was only a matter of time until Hollywood beckoned.
Then the rumors are true?
Don't be shy.  There's time to stop before you go too far.
My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
Mr. Whale?  Are you all right?
I was going to take a swim.
Mr....Kay?
I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
It's been a long time, Memphis --
Yeah -- ?
They gave you only four days?
I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...
Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away from him...
You have my word...
It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ...
I'm on the move -
Not my girl anymore
All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?
Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."
How's it going -- ?
A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. This ain't like the old days, Memphis. The profession has lost its..
We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...
Have you seen him?
He's in some trouble ...
I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...
You goin' home?
It looks just like a regular Mustang --
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
So what are you gonna do?
What happened to you?
You can handle it?
You can handle it?
Shadow games ...
Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little something the R & D department came up with ...
After a while, it became a little pathetic ... Figured I'd put you out of your misery ...
Having fun, Kip?
He give you an advance -- ?
Take it back, Freb --
Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... Let's get into the vans --
And here I am...
Hey.
I go with you --
That's what I want ...
So, you seeing anybody?
C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?
Now... I'm in ...
You're still quite the boost, Randall Raines ...  Except now I've been chopped, and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife ...
Donny got shot ... A jacker ...
This time it's for real?
What -- ?
You remember Junie?
Tell me...
Split it up. Any word on Donny?
You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ... We'll getcha fixed up...
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
What did you hear about that thing?
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?
Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
The bag with the envelopes.
Henry.  Wake up.
Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.
Paulie's gonna make him?
Watch this.
What happened to you?
Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?
It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.
You know what to do?
Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important.  Call from an outside phone. I mean it.
Batts's made. His whole crew is going to be looking for him. This is fucking bad.
Are you okay? What happened?
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.
You want a partner?
You guys know my cousin Mikey Sullivan?
Who's she talking to?
Submit, bitch! Submit! Submit!
When's the arraignment?
What'd you get? You get leniency?
Thanks, Chuck.
You're kiddin' me.
Okay.
I guess so.
Okay.
I don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me.
Morgan, I'm not goin' to "Kelly's Roast Beef" just cause you like the take-out girl. It's fifteen minutes out of our way. MORGAN What else we gonna do we can't spare fifteen minutes?
Morgan, Let's go.
You got fired from pushing a broom, you little bitch.
What's up guys?
Oh my God, I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin' to tell you.
I'm not sure--
I don't think I...Larry?
What class did you say that was?
Hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. That's one thing about Harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time.
To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary.
Codebreaking.
Where is it touching you?
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
Yes. Under two conditions.
This rectangle is subdivided into rectangles. One edge of an inner rectangle is an integer. Can you prove that one edge of the larger rectangle is an integer?
What's that?
This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here--
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
So who won the bet?
Sean.
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
And he mailed it to Hardy--
Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age--
I got it.
You moved?
Jobs doing what?
That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
--No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
--And confuse him--
--And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake--
He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point--
What problems does he have, Sean, that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with--
He can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.
Oh, that's nice--
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.
Where're you going?
Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?
What should I do?
What happened?  You got fired, huh?
That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good.
What?
That's very presumptuous.
You're getting defensive, Will.
Yeah, I read those.
Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
So Christ, call her up.
My wife's dead.
Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?
Would have been nice to catch that game though.
Do you have a soul-mate?
Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate.
Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation.
Yes.
Oh, I know.
Good for you. Congratulations.
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
Five minutes.
I was trying to be smooth.  But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.
Yeah?
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
Oh, you will?
You have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Yeah.
I swear to God.
Why do we always stay here?
I thought you said you'd show me your place.
C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages.
Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you.
Do you play the piano?
I want you to come with me.
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
Short fella. Pale face.
Them wasn't two-for-a-cent candy.
Two and a half cents.
Deputy sheriffs.
No cop can come in here without a warrant.
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
Government.
Excuse me for asking.
Is it fur?
Your granma was a great one, too. The third time she got religion she go it so powerful she knocked down a full-growed deacon with her fist.
They're all gone--or dead.
I ain't no more a preacher, you know.
I'll tell 'em. But I don't know how. Never seen so many guys with guns. Wouldn't even let us talk today.
They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.
Seems like we wasn't never gonna do nothin' but move. I'm so tar'd.
Goin' far?
You people got a lotta nerve.
Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.
What's he fixin' to do, ma?
How 'bout Granma?
*Ain't* a-goin'... ain't a-goin'...
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma?
Ma...  Ma, I--I can't go to the dance. I jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan' it, with Connie not here--an' me this way.
Jus' sassy, that's all.
Know where we're a-goin'?
Make her easy, John. Watch her.
Maybe, but we shore takin' a beatin'.
Mad, Ma?
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
How's it feel, Tommy?
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust.
What is it?
She's gettin' prettier, Ma.
They was some cops here, Ma. They was takin' down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump'n.
I been thinkin' about us, too--about our people livin' like pigs, an' good rich lan' layin' fallow, or maybe one fella with a million acres, while a hundred thousan' farmers is starvin'. An' I been wonderin' if all our folks got together an' yelled--
This here's a fifteen-cent loaf.
They gone.
You mean get off my own land?
How you get all this money?
She's jus' wore out, that's all.
Take 'er on down, Al. I'll sign.
This here's the desert an' we're right in it!
Come on. Ain't nobody gonna say anything.
Jes' like in the catalogues, ain't they!
What's this?
Can you pick peaches?
Lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas. Trouble is they're little, they ain't got much say-so.
What do you do?
We had pictures put on, that way everybody knows who everybody was!
Never better.
I want to be an actor.
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
Hello...?
Which would you rather...?
I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
Will you come with me?
You kill people. 
Say more.
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee.
Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday.
Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury.
Here's the news: He hasn't been in Portugal since '90. I know that from the file. Why don't you read the file, man?
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
I have scruples. Next.
What's it look like?
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
I'm a professional killer.
I uh... ha, ha... I don't think I ever met a lady quite like yourself and I appreciate all the pains you've gone through to --
Doesn't matter.
You lived in Chicago?
I once heard Itzhak Perlman guest star with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He played Rachmaninov's Vocalize Opus 34. No. 14. It was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I ever heard. I actually forgot where I was for a time.  You seem surprised?
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
The answer's no.
Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Thanks.
How long did you live here with your wife?
Son?
How did you meet her?
Grace told me you have a country house in Connecticut. Sounds like a beautiful place.
Ever think of moving there full time?
Everything under control?
You missed a button.
This is Mr. Booker, Robert.
Show me again.
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
Have you decided about Pilgrim?
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
Oh. You didn't tell me.
Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you?
I don't believe this!
That's not true!
You buckled up?  You cold?
We'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch. They have this empty house near this creek. It's actually pretty... OK... I love you.  Dad wants to talk to you.
Did you ask him to come visit?
Well...  So you tried riding again?
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
Well, then I do apologize... But what I'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she's feeling... who can't admit when she's wrong and who can't forgive when she's not.
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
Who is it?
Oh, come on! This is such bullshit! The work is getting done, David. Lucky keeps me on top of everything.
Okay. We'll see you later then.
That bag's almost empty.
What did he say?
You've got to stop doing that?
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
You've already made arrangements!?
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
Oh well... branding will do that to you.
Yeah, what?
Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?
What choice!!?
There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom.
But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time.  I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe.
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
Good luck to you, Annie.
Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace?
Maybe we should give him another sedative.
... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way...  You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen!  Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?
Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room.  I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter.
Don't you go to school?
Of course I have.
You wouldn't want to dance with me, would you?
That's not a question, is it?
I can't... not yet...
It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done.
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
Honey, you all right? Did something fall?
IT WAS MY TURN!
Well, like I told your wife, it's really up to Pilgrim.
You're looking fit.
What are you looking at, young man?
What stuff is that?
You think it's cool?
In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
Welcome to our show!
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
Right.
Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?
Very impressive.
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
Snoop onto them...
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is?
What are you doing?
Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?
Up all night again, huh?
Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.
I'm fine.  Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay?
Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.  You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.
Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!
Two days.
Here's your class.
That's a nice score for a girl.
It's too much machine for you.
Make it our first date.
What?
A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.
Colonel who?
Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.
Any questions?
What the hell was that all about?
But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
Murphy kid turn you down?
The FBI computer holds files on twenty million Americans.  I just hacked into it.
Can I come over after Jamie's asleep?
So?
Its metal, god dammit its metal.
Shit!
How do we look?
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
Found it.
We should call the fire department.
Four plus Myers.
Has he been prepped?
Night Doc.
Okay everybody, listen up. I've got Rachel Corruthers and her sister in the truck, and I'm taking them outta town route 410. State police are on the way. Got that?
What is this? Four nights in a row?  You going for a record here?  The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame?
Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
Come on Rachel!
Rachel come on.
Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.
I didn't know you and Brady had anything okay?
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
You know Rach, Discount Mart is having a sale on Halloween costumes.
You won't come on too strong.
Call me.
Leave Myers for the state boys.
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
Six bodies, Sheriff! That's what I have seen between here and Ridgemont. A filling station in flames. I'm telling you Michael Myers is here in this town. He's here to kill that little girl and anybody that gets in his way.
Is that him? Is that him?
How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me.
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
You're going to be late!
Sure.
Well, are we still on for tonight?
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
I'm scared.
I wonder where they went.
Go get me a beer.
I gotta go.
Yeah, sure.
What do we do?
Sure...
Exactly what do you need?
I watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing THIS NIGHT. He's waited for it, inhumanly patient. Hour after hour, day after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him. Death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. You can ignore it, or you can help me stop it.
I thought you were babysitting tonight.
Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble.
Are you coming over tonight?
..."how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..."
Not any more.
What about the rest of my comic books?
The bogyman!
Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey.
I'm scared!
Hello.
...then he gets another physical by the state, and he makes his appearance before the judge. That should take four hours if we're lucky, then we're on our way.
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
Ever done anything like this before?
It means... I see.
And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.
We're a big hit.
Wow, it's the red one?
Oh!
Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
It's French, though.  It really is.
That's disgusting!
Well, I live downtown.
Uh...
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
We got that idea on that trip to Paris.
Excuse me, are there any more claims?
I can't resist.
Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...
Oh, what, what do you do?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
Now I ca-can't remember.
And it's just in one ear?
Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
How about you?
Yeah, you would.
Fine.  Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met.  It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick.  I mean...you learn so much.  Do you like Caravaggio?
e.e. cummings.  I'd like to get you this.
I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  A poem of  his and thought of you last--  You'll be fine, though.  Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle.  She looks at the book.
I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
He's got like six gold records.
They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.
I was looking for you.
Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us.
You matter to me.  Completely.
Hi.  How's she doing?
Well, because I never thought of God in my life.  Now I'm giving it serious thought.
How do you know?
...or films you must see or... 
What's the problem?
Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
Oh, Jesus!
N-n-no, not that.
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
But you don't have any symptoms!
It was on your shirt!
Yes!
I'm okay.
Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know.  He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
Let me get a little reaction here.  How's Elliot?
Isn't that great?
Go right over there.
This is the second opinion.
Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said you could adopt one--
Okay, stop being so dramatic.
What?  You're kidding!
Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!
Not this Thanksgiving, you know.
Sometimes she's terrific...
What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
Good.
Well--
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
Come on, Mickey.  Come on.
...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
Oh, that's putting it mildly.  We did everything but exchange gunshots.
Good.  How are you?
So how are you?
Are you, are you out of work or something?
I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
Oh, I'm fine.
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  Well, it's not my first script.
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
Right.
It's all right.
When'd you get here?
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
Dad...
Aren't you glad to see me?
...<u>please</u>...
To <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  What one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...
...how are things at the Hospital?
I'm looking for...
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
Who would that be.
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
How you doin?
That's right.
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
Who, can you think, who would want to harm Dr. Fanelli, did he have any <u>enemies</u>, that...
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.
Please, I do not... I don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
...here's to child abuse!
...and then, he'll be coming down.
Yes, I did.
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
I think that's... {HE STARTS TO RISE, AND THE MEETING BEGINS TO BREAK UP) Starling, I'm sure these gentlemen...
Waited too long, hon...?  
Give it up, Evelda.
Give it up.
My mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men.
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.
Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard?  Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.
Who does not?
Yes.  Franklin, you can't live there anymore.  With Mama and Shirly and Kittykat.  You have to go away.
And you let her get away.
No, I don't get you...
I came to pay my...
...may be the heat....
I'd prefer you to say what you feel.
Why should <u>you</u> care?
What's that, Baby?
Yeah, well, they solved that:  turns out, he'uz a <u>cannibal</u>...
Yeah, well, it's a raw wound, innit, you're gonna bump it, every time you turn around... but you know what the <u>trick</u> is...?
My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
No.
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
What would you guess, Ardelia?
Give me your gun...
...the purpose of the exercise... is it because they are <u>expensive</u>...
I don't understand.
I know where he is.
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
<u>Do</u> you.  What does that mean?
...a Dr. Fell.  A Brazilian, I think. Applying for Fanelli's post.
...a <u>liaison</u> position...
...<u>barter</u> with her.  To appeal to her, and you feel that...
Yes.
Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.
My encounter.
You think you're so...but you're just...
I'll bet you're glad I waited until the last day to have this conversation.
Okay, okay, just don't everyone talk at once...First of all, little Jason has a learning disability...
I'm in the picture on Wendy's wall. Niagara Falls. Family trip. Little Wendy foreground. Me background. What are the odds on that one?
Freeze!  You're busted!
Thanks, Talia...Why are you so nice to me?
Goodnight, Jasper.
That would be a No.
I don't know what I'm doing. I know he only likes me as a friend. He's just so...everything--I know he only likes me as a--but it came up that he used to be a camp counselor and I used to be a camp counselor...
...sorry...
One day they'll find a cure for AIDS. They'll never find one for sex. It's kind of funny, most movies and stories with a bunch of camp counselors has some serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw who systematically butchers everybody one by one.
Well, the first week of camp has swhooshed on by and I thought this a perfect time to finally pow-wow. I think we should discuss--
"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
When were you in Niagara Falls?
Todd was out there blocking the                             ] entrance. You would have been proud                         ] of me...My suit of armor is starting to come off. Not all of it, but enough to walk around...
I was thinking...if we could mesh my way of thinking with your way                            ] of thinking, we could really do some                        ] great counseling. It's all about                            ] the evolution of the species, we                            ] can improve...                                              ]
Fuck off.
Let me get it clear, Veronica. You want yourself a sweet homeboy for this T.V. show so you can show everybody what a loose, Martin Luther Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is.
You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing.
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
What do you want from me?
Guess who?
I said I was sorry.
Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!
No way, no day!
Veronica. What are you doing tonight?
What were <u>you</u> trying to do? Sleep?
Probably just row on out to the middle of a lake. Bring along my sax, some tequila, and some Bach.
O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime. But if this was like a suicide thing.....
Heather Chandler is more popular than ever now.
Do you take German?
This knife is filthy.
You really fucked me up, Veronica.
Let's kick his ass.
Answer him dick!
Turn that back on!
Mummy has a special technique called "Deep Therapy."
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.

What now?
accompanies Hilda into the hallway.

 Got an A, Mum!
He's the manager!
Come on, sit up.
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
Can I go now?
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!

To be known as He!
Him.
That.
Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.
Bye, Dad.
Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?
So, I'm done. Thats it for today?
Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.
Hey if you're not doing anything I'd like to buy you a beer after work. Be just like old times.
Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead.
Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
You're alive...
Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?
Trevor your body has been completely healed. All the nerve endings have repaired themselves. If there is any pain in your head it's... in your head.
Wait... what the hell is this...
... knock on my door, I'm a total insomniac.
Tawny? What's- what are you doing?
A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
Hey, Bubber, c'mere!  I gotta talk to you, buddy.
I just wanna talk with you for a minute.  Then you can jump.  You can jump twice for all I care.
I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me...
You stole her purse!  While you were saving her?
You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me.
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
Uh, I know you're having financial difficulties, Mister LaPlante, but I wonder if... I mean, the money I loaned you...
Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right?  You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer.  They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms!  Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages...
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
What wouldja say if I toldja I ran into a burning plane an' saved a buncha people, Chick, an' risked my goddamnlife?
The thing is, Chick.  I'm goin' down.
Bill, I...
Bill, I got some legal problems and I...
He waited for you three hours!
I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
Turn that thing off.
If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.
"Harassed."  Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo?  The guy's a thief, he took my...
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
Here we are.  Yeah, that's a possibility.  A movie.  Now you gwan in, tell your mother I got you back on time.  Point that out to her. She was always on my case for stuff like that.  She's still like that, right?
Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...
You were... very... inspiring.
"A little mistake"!
Did you get it?  Jesus, did I say that?
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
We're gonna feature Gale's cast more.  The trick is gonna be keeping the upper hand on this piece. As long as we have Gale and there's no mystery guy, we're the center of the story.  But if he shows up and somebody else gets him first or exclusive...
He lost a shoe!
If I gave you the impression I hated him I didn't mean to.  I... I hate the way he <u>behaves</u>... he's selfish and self-centered and cynical...
I haven't won it yet.  I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.
No dead body.  Too bad.  Not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. Exclusive!
Is he like that in real life?  So gorgeous?
I didn't ask him.
So, <u>Neil</u>.  How's it goin'?
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
And what about work?  Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now?
And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that?
On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --
I was driving by -- I saw all the cars.  Are you all right?
Yeah, right -- I really have to go to bed.
Have you just plain asked him?
Has anyone seen Rudolf?  I don't think he came in last night.
Whew.
Where'd he go?
I <u>remember</u> what day you wore that jacket.  It was <u>Monday</u>.  The day you were all day in <u>meetings</u> again?  And had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>?
The cab's waiting!
He wants to see me!
His secretary just confirmed.
Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags!
What?
Should I come home when I'm finished there?
Dad, we can't decide unless Rudolf gets to look too!
We'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then?
If you want that baseball jacket for your birthday, Neil, learn to cough a little more realistically.
A <u>man</u> started the fire.
And this -- is the master bedroom.
I'd like that.
Really?
Hey, I don't have answers for this. I just brought you down here because of the sword.
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
Good -- also, give it to the papers and TV.
Detective Bedsoe.
Tell me again.  Where'd you go?
I'm gonna nail you, Nash.  That's a promise.
The days of magic are ending.  The world is changing.
You cannot run from your destiny, Conner.
Sing.
Maybe myself.
Thank you, Thomas.
As friends -- always as friends.
That is a thought that doesn't please me.
To ask her to dance.
I stood up first.
Then take me with you.
If it's good advice.
You're hurt.
What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
Then who's Russell Nash?
Why do you stare at me like that?
Do you always walk around with a sword?
You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
That makes you uncomfortable?
Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--
Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
Be careful, Conner.
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
Don't leave us, Conner.
I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
Would you like to deposit this in your account?
Talley.
I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.
That woman's gonna call the cops.
We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot!
I have to tell you something --
Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up?
We're fucked.
There is no way out.
I'll give you these people.
That you, Talley?
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide.
We can take it with us.
Cops want to be rich like everyone else. All we have to do is share.  And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars.
Are you out of your mind?
If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end.
I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
I'll kill you!  You won't get the other disk!
Can we talk some more when you get here?
Ow!  Shit!
I'm not gonna leave you!
Now we can do whatever we want.
We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.
Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.
If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.
Let it go, Captain.
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
It's right in front of us.
I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
That's on the second floor.  Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?
What do you want me to do?
I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's personal tax --
Where are my children?
Did you find the disks?
Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass. Do you understand?
You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president.
We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
Paul, I've sent my soldiers to rescue the Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room.
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two. I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I will have to scrounge it.
I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.
The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us. What do you think would have happened? No different.
I will see what I can do.
General, sir. I am glad to find you. I have found you some supplies.
You are a marked man.
Satellite feed.
Holy shit! Holy shit.
You fucking see that!
Here, have a sandwich.
The news room has heard that the French and the Belgians are putting together an intervention force.
Mr. Manager.
Where are we going, sir?
The fog is too heavy, sir.
Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?
Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
Do something.
Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.
The president has been murdered.
Where are Thomas and Fedens?
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
Please, Paul, 'til first light.
This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they fled or could not make it home. There is hope.
Listen to me woman. I said all the whites are leaving. The French, the Italians, even the Belgian UN soldiers.
Can I have your name again?
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
What is it like to fly on a plane, sir?
You have taken business class?
Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here.
Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me.
We'd've been splitsville years ago, with me the richest single woman in recorded history -- but Steven doesn't "believe" in divorce.
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
-- bullshit --
How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
And how the hell are we going to do that?
If you don't mind me asking... Who are you?
Part of the original structure. When it was still an asylum. Guy who ran the place -- Dr. Vannacutt -- found it "inspirational." From some German cathedral a million years ago: "Driving the Demons From the Mind."
Mr. Price? Mrs. Price? Somebody? Hello??
Why in God's name wasn't this thing removed years ago??
What are you playing here, Price?
Just for the record: what are the rest of your names?
Upstairs, too. Come with me, I'll show you another body, a friend of mine named Schecter --
Put it this way: if it's your face on that tape, Mr. Moses, we're one gunshot away from solving all our problems --
You're totally full of shit, aren't you?
So you're saying as long as that door stays locked, we're okay?
New wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia. 19th Century, I think: what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane. The Vannacutt version was: bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce, it'd traumatize 'em back to "normalcy."
Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.
-- the stained glass --
Good point.
What --
The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
I knew this whole place'd be pure gold! Pritchett, point me in the direction of the goddamn ghosts! If I can get something bizarre enough on tape, I think I can parlay it into getting me some kind'a Robert Stack "Unsolved Most- Wacked-Out Home Videos" gig. No more five afternoons a week of sex-change- Nazis-and-the-lesbos-that-love-'em.
So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?
You know how happy I'd be if that was really true, Evelyn? And how positively goddamn delirious if you weren't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time!
-- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.
And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?
Game, set and match, Steven. You've outdone yourself. And I know it's not good manners to ask the magician how he did it, but inquiring minds are desperate to know: just what did really happen to Ms. Marr?
I mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --
-- oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --
They weren't loaded when I put them in there!
I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.
Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.
You think this is fucking funny??
Please! Something! Oh-God!
-- it's getting older by the second. Mr. Price, if I could just please have --
House 2, Guests 0.
-- then I guess then it had to be you. Sorry.
Vannacutt!!
I'll take my chances.
Problem where? Looked good to me.
Don't know that it does.
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
You coming, or are you waiting for Blackburn?
-- hey! --
For the love of God....please...?
Town records are coming up now.
I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
Good-bye.
The dagger is used to free those possessed if stabbed directly into the heart, according to ancient beliefs -
Can I do it again tonight?
Can you talk to her?
My angel!
Where are we going to go, mommy?
She says she's lonely...
Oh my God!  She's in there!
I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.
Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.
Well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it wasn't.  I'll have to call her.
What the hell is that?
No.  Maybe it was Aubrey.
...set up some more things.
But do you agree with me?
What are you talking about?
We'll destroy you...destroy all of you!
Not at all.  I'm just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be.
I think we should do it.
I'm not sure, but I can check.  Did the events start before or after you discovered this?
Maura.
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
Now you must listen to me. This force is like a parasite, or a virus. It feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her.
Concentrate!  She can hear you!
You must be the new tenants.
What was she afraid of?
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
How long will it take!
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
Under The Underground.  Can I like GO now?!
I put some decaf on.  Er ... make yourself comfortable.
... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is.
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff.
... but it is good.  You know, over to the left, you can ...
What am I looking for?
Everything sold as is.  No guarantees. No returns.
Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
What ... What ... ?
Don't flee from yourself.  If you have a quality, let it define you.  Cultivate it.  It is you.  By helping me, you will help yourse...
Joey?
JP?
Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.
Yes. 53
That was beautiful.
Eighth room down, babe...
Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
Those dago-guinea-I can say this shit I'm Italian-wop motherfu--
The safe's a Simpson 71.  Last time I played the game, Simpson only had a 40.
I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers. Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford Auction House.  By the way, how many seconds?
They record everything their video surveillance takes in...
"He can't write his name or read a book.  To fool people is his only thought."
Now that's a lock.
This is the room above the Art Treasures room.  The lock is a Natalya Z-Z, first created...
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that...
Come on, this stuff will knock you out.  Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr. Bond.
God, I wish I could say the same thing.  What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians....
Let's just say, I never saw E.T.
tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.
Hey, don't take your disguise so seriously.
Oh Hudson...
Da Vinci made the real directions in a secret script that I decoded. The way the machine is running now, the gold will produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down.  Isn't it wonderful?
Way to go, Anna.
It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead.
You're hitting Rutherford's Auction House.  Easy as my brother's wife.  Directions are in the bag.  Just open the seventh floor safe and take out the thingie...
Good job, not pretty, but good.
The auction house, asshole.  One night's work and you're free like no ex-con's ever been.  No checking in with a shrink, no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey. It's a great deal, I can't lie.
Cool, isn't it?  Weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical.  On the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart.  Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless.
This is the worst night...
If you do anything to my friend...
Can't you see the Mayflowers double-crossed you...
The Hoop-dee-doo!
Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold all of our stock?
Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
About seven minutes.
You're from Muncie?!
...You know! For kids!
Well, she probably had a deadline...
Smitty.
...What happened?
Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
I tell ya the guy's a phony.
As a three-dollar bill.
...On payday! The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al.
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
Just got hired today!
Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.
You know what they're doin' now, Lou.
Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid businessman on the street?
I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
...This'll only take a moment.
...Well, I'm not sure where I --
-- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins!
Well, frankly, I...
...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
...education, were you?
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
At the Muncie College of Business Administration.
...'Shnook'? 'Dope'? 'Dipstick'? 'Lamebrain'?
Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
Relax, Norville. It's only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover.
Ya don't say.
Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --
...Enter the dame.
...and awduhs a light lunch.
Maybe he's wise.
At the Houmfort.
Believe me, Mrs. Rand, he doesn't do this often. This is the first time I've seen him --
Thank you, Mrs. Rand.  I think you're every bit as nice as Wes says you are.
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
She can never be cured?
I've worked with it.  I've seen cures. It is at least a hope.
Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.
It seems we are having dinner by ourselves, Miss Connell.  But I may as well introduce everyone to you, anyway.  There -- in the master's chair, sits the master -- my half-brother Paul Holland.  But you've already met him.
As a matter of fact, it means the sugar syrup is ready to be poured off.  You'll have to excuse me.
Bring me another, Ti-Joseph.  I have to keep the lady entertained.
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
Betsy, can I talk to you a minute?
Does she suffer?  Does she know what she is?
She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
You know what she is!  That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!
No, Wes.
Can't I take it for you?
I made it clear in my letter to the company.  This is not a position for a frightened girl.
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
I've never given it much thought.
I heard about your little misadventure yesterday, Miss Connell.  On your first "day off," too.
I know what you went through tonight.  I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.
Well?
You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
You wanted to warn me...
Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
Wesley!
Investigation of what?
We're all in it.  There won't be a shred of pride or decency left for any of use.  Say something, Paul!  You've always been good with words.  Put some together, now, and tell us that you're not responsible -- that every damnable bit of it doesn't rest squarely on your shoulders!
Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?
Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?
Then again, why should she be? I mean with us, with our...
Good night.
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
You crying?
Whatever that means Elena -- And you complain about me not communicating... I thought it was --
Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday.
Yeah, that one.
It's a starting place.
If you're going to insult me --
Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.
Damn it, Ben --
I'll drive you --
Do you think? Maybe we should call someone --
Yeah. Well, we can just --
Well dad, actually I thought I'd take the morning train on Thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying, papers, you know, lab experiments --
Holy! Well. If you're worried about anything, just feel free to ask, and, uh, we can look it up.
You have a point there. That's a very good point. We're having an affair. Right. An explicitly sexual relationship. Your needs. My needs. You're absolutely right.
Fascist!
He's probably been waiting all night at the station.
It's not the taxes I object to. It's all the fines and penalties.
Oh. Elena wanted to know when we could expect you on Thanksgiving. It's just going to be you this year.
Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward, OK? If you don't --
I saw you on your bike today.
I don't like coffee.
I used to know how to cook.
Here you are.
-- And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.
If that's a potential you see yourself fulfilling... I mean...  My, I sound a bit --
You're here... I'm a bit surprised.
Arise and shine, young Hood.
Flame on, asshole.
Check it out. Not for the faint of heart.
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
Frankie opens them with his teeth.
My what?
I'm in love with Libbets Casey.
Did you tell Sandy?
Why did you -- with Sandy?
Hello, Charles.
Is this Charles?
Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?
Yes, sir.
Just after Leland Street.
Nice kid.
So far.
And then I lost him.  In the fog.
She your only sibling?
I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records.
Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell.  Her things are in the house.
No.  But I covered it up.  I lied.
Thanks.
Good.
Where you signed this?
What happened at that signing?
They're all over everybody.
That's right.
Well her mother didn't buy them for her.
What if someone finds out?
I told you I don't remember.
I never met anyone from Seattle before.
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
Thought you might find that.
I suppose.
Randy Stetz is in jail.
I thought maybe we could talk some more.
What the hell do you know?
Don't you pull that shit with me.
Yes.  Like that.
Monstrous.
Who made us what we are?
My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.
The one who made you should have told you this. The one who left the old world for the new...
Are these not the answers you came for?
I want some more.
Which of you did it? Which of you made me the way I am?
And if I cut my hair again?
You see the old woman? That will never happen to you. You'll never grow old. You will never die.
You... fed on me?
In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means.
He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He deserved to die.
But this can't be real. This is nonsense.
They use no paint. And the audience think it is paint.
This is no performance.
I lothe them! I can't stand the sight of them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I've searched for them the world over and I despise them!
Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it!
She is dying. It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember.
You want death? Is it death you want?
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
You're not afraid of anything, are you?
You let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. We'll start with him.
Let's call that a start.
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
Did I hear a yes?
Take him.
You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly.
But we can live without taking human life. It's possible.
What do you imagine you are Louis?
Unless I make her one of us...
Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.
Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy.
Well, what a lucky break for me.
You loved Yvette...
But why did you tell her?
Did he die in the fire?
You found nothing?
You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!
You're in 201 and 202.
Wait...Did you say off-season?
Storm season?
You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me?
I thought you were out of town!
There's nothing between Will and me.
Hello? Hello?
No.
I know I don't want to stay in here.
Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. There's no way off this place.
I don't know...
I understand something.
Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it.
Okay, I'll try. But, listen...  If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time.
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.
The shower again?
It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better.
Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
Julie? What's wrong?
Guess the capital of Brazil --
You think that's a good place to hide?
Well, I'm in school and --
Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
Jeez, that's a full carat --
Well, there's some flaws in her...
You stumbled into my hiding place.
Can't talk right now.
Where is everybody?
I'd like to, very much -- but it depends on what dispatches are waiting for me on the mainland.
If the wind shifts, if the sirocco blows -- the hot wind from the South -- all danger will be over in twenty-four hours.
She's right. This is hardly the time to bandy old tales.
You're just talking nonsense.
We will see who is the first to die.
I suppose you want to hear my prayer to Hermes.
Did you hear what Thea said -- as if she knew what threatens us.
Another sad task. We'll bury her tomorrow.  I think we'd better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less uncomfortable.
You were singing, weren't you? A beautiful voice, Miss St. Aubyn.
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
Good night, Oliver.
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
I know it must be hard. But you have relatives in London --you've got a whole world of living, ahead of you --
My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!
Miss Wollsten shares the room with you?
It's getting dark. I can't leave now.
Why, I'm fond of Thea.
I've always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours  but this, Cathy -- even I would never have believed it is of you.
I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure - quite sure.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live - I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?
Your daughter is ill.
I had a notion you had become selfappointed chaperone lately  why?
That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle -
What's bothering you, Thea? Is it the General?
Thea, what is this? What are you trying to tell me? "He stole your mother" -
All right, put up your hands. No fast moves. Come on out here, both of you.
Stand back.
Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? Bert, listen!  It's that fellow there  he says he's an angel  he's tried to hypnotize me.
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
Go through with what?
Oh, no.
Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
What'd you say?
What did you say?
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here?  Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . .
Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
Where? I don't see a thing.
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
Splendid! Is he sick?
I want the Board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months. Good luck to you at school, George.
Thank you very much.
If either of you two see a stranger around here, it's me.
Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it.
There it is, good as new.
What?
So long, George. See you in the funny papers.
Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. How much does this cost?
Hmmm . . .
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
Oh . . .
You're not paid to be a canary.
No . . . No . . . No. . .
Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey! Don't you know me?
Yes, you bet.
I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
Well, no younger than I was.
Oh, well, you know what I've always talked about  build things . . . design new buildings  plan modern cities  all that stuff I was talking about.
Hello, George, how are you?
Do me a favor, will you, George?
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?
Why didn't you call me?
Those Rockefellers!
Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
I'm not very good at this.
Eighteen.
What'd you wish, George?
If I told you it might not come true.
About what?
Zuzu! What's the matter with Zuzu?
Is she running a temperature? What is it?
Mary! Mary!
Oh, Mom  I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
You forgot something.
Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
Come on, you guys.
It's okay, it's okay....
Get on the rocks!
Shut up.
Coming up!  Give way!
As soon as you get us on the island, you got to call in.  My dad's the mayor....
I thought you said she was going with us?
Sean!   Catch the rope!
Tina!
What is it?  What's there?
On your own time?
We got a helluva tide this month.
Because.
Michael.
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
Could be a shark.  But maybe not.
You have to smoke so early in the morning?
Eat Cheerios.
Oww!
Nothing.
I know what you're going to say.
Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they....
What're you doing?
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
Yeah?  Then what?
Can I go with you today?
I want you to meet my cousin.
Mike!  Are you going out?
Terry!  You okay?
Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
Take a break for a minute, okay?
Come on back up here!
What about sailing?
But first, a little juice....
Anything.  Anything.
Right after, the Kids went out?
Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go, then you can't go.  Neither of you can go.
What is it?
I don't care.
Heading back?
I don't think she's such hot stuff.
Michael....
And if you have any questions about recreational possibilities, Ellen Brody here will be happy to answer them.
It hasn't adjusted.
We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
What's your plan, Brody?
It's Miller time!
Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?
Are you scared?
Damn it!
... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?
Where are you going?
Fine piece of engineering.
After this has opened, when everything's settled down, you and I are going away.  Just the two of us.  No dolphins, no sharks, no whales, no penguins. Just you and me.
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
Honey, what is it?
Michael, take deep breaths.
Yes, you can.
That's what I've come to ask you. Is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing?
Somebody better get down there!
Michael, you don't have to go down there.
Nobody told me.
I can have them walk backwards.
You can get killed!
Like hell!
You look like an orange worm.
How's sleeping beauty?
He's big as a bloody bus!
We can assume he's back in the water intake passage.
He's a young one.
I knew it;  it's my fault.  We moved it too soon.
Musclehead?
I was seeing this guy off.  He flew in from Dallas.  Wants to marry me.  He's okay, but Texans are so possessive.
You gonna work at The Kingdom?
Sure am.
You were great out there!
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
Isn't this fun!
Told you you'd like it.
Did you see that?
Yes, there is goes.
Your friend Overman picked a hell of a time to come back.
We see him, Mike.  Between the stadium and the ski show island.
Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!
How'd you do in school?
How is he?  Still fighting crime?
Okay, you two, have a good life without me.  I gotta go.
Mike, this is fantastic.  I mean, you're responsible for building all this.  What a job you've done! Maybe I'll quit school and come down here and work with you. Brody Brothers Construction. We've always wanted to do that together.  Boat building.
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
You want to show this?
You said it wasn't polite to interrupt people....
Where are you going?
What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....
Like mother, like son....
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
What the hell are we arguing about?
Close the door.
Sweetheart....
Why didn't you tell us?  Why didn't you tell us?
No cooking while you're here...No washing dishes...No cleaning....
Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....
What the hell's it doing in warm water anyway...?
Stop that....
I see what you're doing....
Don't be late.
I almost forgot....
I will.  I'll miss you, Grandma.
It came for him.  It waited all this time and it came for him....
Sit down, Ma....
You're damn right I'm serious....
There's never been a great white where we live.  It's warm water... They don't like it....
Oh, it looks like my uncle's.  He taught me how to sail when I was a kid....
Nothing out of the ordinary....
You could teach...You could....
It's late....
You look tired....
You and Sean used to make....
No....
I don't know why I've told you all this.  I hardly know you.
I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.
How can you just take the plane like this?
I don't know how....
What are you doing?
It's just like driving a car....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
The kind with an umbrella in it....
I tried winter once.  Burlington, Vermont.  Flew a run to New York.  I have a bone in my foot that still hasn't thawed.  When I was a small boy....
I could take some time off....
Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean.  We could take a few days....
It was theirs anyway.  I 11 buy us all a drink....
Grab your socks....
What say we get the hell out of here, Ellen Brody. ...
Come on, Hoagie....
Matt?
Yeah....
We're being paid to see where they go...How they propagate....
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
Bad boy....
Sharp shirt, Jake....
Office of Naval Research has some money....
A regular tropo...Spend the rest of your life in a bathing suit, living off nickel and dime grants.  You want to be a bum all your life, be my guest.  Not me.  I'm not growing old chasing snails and dying from terminal crotch rot....
You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....
Where is everybody?
What happened to Clarence and...?
What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?
We're out of money, partner.. We wrap it up, write it up and turn it in... How come your heart sounds stronger than mine?  You got two of them...?
And it's always worked?
How long?
Bring her to starboard.
What's so funny about that?
Half don't...Bring her about....
We lost it....
Funny, Jake...Funny.
Shit....
All the time....
Your equipment has crapped out again....
I'll do it, Jake.
I knew there was a reason I could afford this.  To the woman of my dreams.. Who grows more beautiful....
That man keeps calling about his training film.  I can't convince him we don't have a S.W.A.T. team.
I'll take care of it.
Did you like that, Mama?
Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.
What? Whatta you mean, no? Who is -- who is telling you? Whatta you mean, no? Yes, you'll wear pink or else. Or else you'll wear pink.  And, darlin', oh, I'm gonna take you to Coney Island.
I'm sorry to worry you with this, but we had a real serious robbery, and we- 're chasing a white V.W. van? You guy came up an the computer, so as a matt- er of routine we have to check. Could you tell me who's driven it recently?
I dunno .. Guess the dozer musta shifted him? You need some hands up here to look ..
No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist."
What about that kid, Ross?
What do you think?
We give it one more hour. Did the photographer do the dogs?
You gotta stop smoking ..
We're going.
Why?
I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.
You gotta stop calling Los Angeles .. You're dragging L.A. around with you like an addiction.  Look at the shit you're putting yourself through? For what? For <u>nothing</u>, I know it, I been there. Remember me? Up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes?  If there's a body under the snow, <u>fuck</u> <u>it</u>. Let somebody else worry about it. You gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this ..
Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
What about Citrine?
Can't thank you enough, Ross ..
Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..
What if we need a back up?
Alright. I'll start at the top, and work down.
How do you know her hair's black?
I <u>have</u> heard you. You just don't like hearing <u>me</u>. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, <u>in this country</u>, would put a task force together for a body part ..
I'm shutting you down on this "blind thing," John.
Alright, you got it. And I'll be putting an Observer in with you.
.. feel like I'm getting close to this guy .. and all the time, feel like I'm sharpening a pencil with a broken load .. I'm sorry, King J ..
His blind friend got "attacked." Angelo went up there, and some- how, it got itself in the paper.
You don't know what you done, Taylor.
As recent as we have .. What ex- actly is your interest in Amber?
You must have some idea about him.
John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John?
I suppose I'm the worst witness you've ever had?
I'm sorry, someone slammed the door on me. I couldn't get out.
Are you married?
Pray?
Ross told me.
Just your age.
Has he got your aunt's address?
You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?
Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u>  ..
He doesn't need my help.
A blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with?
Yeah, I guess I do.
What does that mean?
You think he still loves her?
Is that Margie?
Such a shame .. She's a really sweet kid ..
He's happy, darlin ..
Except for the hair color, she looks just like Suzanne?
You want something, darling?
I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
I know.  Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there --
Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now.
You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry? There is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party.
Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
Wonder what he said.
But I mean really... wonderfully...  great.
It's all going to work.
It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.
Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222.
Oh my God.
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a seat. I'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too.
Well, good evening.
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
I was thinking I hope he doesn't get injured. I felt responsible.
Why do you love me?
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.
This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room.  Send me in there, I'll do it alone. And now I just... I don't know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because I couldn't share it with you.  I couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you.  I missed my wife.  We live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh --  I love you.  You complete me.
Because I'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head.
Oh, thank you.
Not right now, Jerry.
I got it.
You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there?  Did I ever tell you my Nike story?
What are you doing with me, Rod?
Dude, know your art form.  If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful.  There's no need for a camel... you got ME.
First, single mothers don't "date." They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her?
Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife.
I'm asking you a question --
Not everyone has what you have.
I'm sorry I asked.
That's an answer.
Jerry!  You made it --
Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
That's when you need to cement, and define define define.
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
I'm fine.  What's up?
... dick?
You wanted smaller.
Let's go the zoo.
I won't tell.
Now go kiss your daddy, quick.
ERRR-IIIC!
Eric!
Do you think it goes all the way across?
Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else.
How much weight have you lost?
You hate to swim.
Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory.
No, Dr. Grant says...
What did you say!
Udesky.
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
We should try fishing again.
Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, thats where he's headed.
Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.
So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?
How was your trip? Profitable?
Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
He used to know me.
So, Mark's working at the State Department now.
Anything good?
We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
Eric, your parents are both here.
I have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. Those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts.
See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
It's strikes me now I never told her that.
Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?
We're safe!
Well that's good.
But alone?  We always had great success together, you and I.
You hear something?
You are an academic.
InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
Are you looking for a problem?
What?
You signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw.  You violated that agreement.
We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.
What?
What are they?
No.  I'm quite certain you can't.
You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
Can you set up?
That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
Oh, God.
Ian.  It's guano.
These formations.  They're dried --
That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
-- way we could safely --
Hold it down, Nick!
The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die.
Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.
Yes.  We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat them.
Malcolm's okay for now.  I gave him a shot of morphine.
A drought.  The lake was shrinking - -
The what?
Anything else, you old fossil?
Constantly sick.
- - like birds - -
Ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks!
Dr. Sattler, I've seen a lot of animal attacks.  People just disappear.  No blood, no trace.  	That's the way it happens.
Okay, I'm on channel two.
Oh, imperfections?
Unpredictability....
Alan?
Faster, faster!
Hey!  Where did you find those things?
Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.
This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters  animatronics?
I read your book.
Because they sure don't look like birds to me.  I heard a meteor hit the earth and made like this one hundred mile crater someplace down in Mexico - -
I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!
I threw up.
'Course you could just wait in there while we go back and get help.
Go, go, go, jump!
I didn't say you were scared.
Ah - - they're here.
It's safe.
What if the dinosaur comes back while we're all asleep?
Go away!
I like cows.
C'mon Tim, move down, damn it!
Do as he says!  The power's coming back, Timmy!
Don't do that!
Alright Donald, alright, but just let him talk.  I want to hear all viewpoints.  I truly do.  I truly am.
I think perhaps I'll just sit down.  I don't suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?
I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -
I hate trees!
Jump, Timmy!  It's too late!
That's not true...
Janet, are you okay? Are you there?
I can't wait to hear your opening argument.	"Ladies and Gentlemen	of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..."
Who?
Ruby... this guy almost took out an entire Tactical Response Team. You can't expect me to just leave you --
That's right... it... it came right out of his chest...
"Zombie Sluts From Beyond the Grave."
This is bad, Joe. The Prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists. They'll argue exactly the opposite. They'll say he's just pretending to be catatonic and he's completely sane.
Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
Oh?
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
Krueger... doesn't ring a bell.
Uh-huh...
See this?
It's as though there were two people in that room... both of them asleep... both of them dreaming.
Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.
You're not going to be there?
What are you doing?
So Krueger thinks Jason's dead... leaves him in the lake... but the boy actually wakes up on the shore... crawls off into the woods... where he lives the rest of his life alone.
If I'm right, this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood.  That means that Jason might've been Krueger's first victim.
Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.
What's that?
Ten minutes...
What happened? Where's Jason?
Fine -- terrible.
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
-- You appreciate my writing.
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
Did you see him?
In an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all.
Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann?
Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?
You've been with the firm for nearly nine years.  You've done your work diligently, there are no complaints on that score.  But there's more to the job than the work -- there are other people to consider -- and frankly, Kafka, we eel your social situation could bear improving.
To do my work well, I have little time for --
I usually take lunch by the River.
I did not realize it was obligatory.
Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.
I was having an affair with Eduard.  He didn't tell you?
Are you free tonight?
Eduard wanted to marry me.
Yes -- which is why "quiet, dependable people" have to take charge of their own lives.
They're not obliged to tell.
Burgel doesn't like anybody!
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
Gabriela ...?
I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
Your office is the Workmen's --
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
He wasn't a lonely man, though.
You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.
I didn't realize you'd been here that long.
-- I was just trying to finish some work!
Why are you so aggressively unimaginative?  Eduard is no longer the only casualty.
Through a very unfortunate -- and I might add extremely rare -- mishap, a document intended for the one department was sent to the other.  And for the first time -- though your friend wasn't aware of it -- two and two could have been put together to make one.
I'm overworked as it is.  "Raban" did you say?
Where do our records go to in the Castle?
I could always apply there.
I understand he was wounded in the lung.
Out! Out! All of you! We have been issued with an exclusive permit -
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
There's a light up ahead.
Barricade the gates! Quick!
I guess that answers your questions. There's no island on these co- ordinates - not even a lousy fog-bank.
You are most kind. We will be proud to assist you!
What was it, Jack?
Not me. Thought I'd head out west ... get into some Redwood country.
Did you fear for your life?
It must have been terrifying?
Yes?
Guess!
I do not love him.
Do you always have to repeat?
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?
I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not.
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
Gee.
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
Company outing or picnic or something like that.
Everything that's happened since Tom Grunemann disappeared. The phone calls and the --
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
Klute, tell me, what's your bag? Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? Or --
Is there anything more I could --
I've checked the records of Jane McKenna's death -- I can't get anything special. But Frank Ligourin had another girl you said, besides McKenna and you.
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.
How can you do it to yourself?
Please. I said I don't want you to do this.
How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.
What?
You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.
You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?
You must be discouraged.
That who?
What?
No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
Would you like to know what's in it? The report.
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
Not unusual.
No.
He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything.
That's how the other one died, you know. In the water.
I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
The subject got emotionallv disturbed; he just dropped out. There's thousands.
Does that distress you?
That's Kim...and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin.
Oh, sure.  Here, this can be mommy.
Huh?...Oh God...What time is it?
When is mommy coming back?
What if she forgets?
You're late.
Yeah?
Sure.  Too much birthday cake, right?
That's not the right soap.  We use the kind in the green and yellow box.
All it is is onions and gravy.
I want my...mm...ommy...I want mmmy...mommy...
Daddy?
I don't think so.
Now go to sleep.  It's very late.
See you in the morning light.
Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite...
Did mommy ever see this?
Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
Because...Well, that's what he does.  He's a very powerful man.
This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.
Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?
Objection, your honor!  Counsel is harassing the witness.
And how did you find his work?
Ted was a good worker.  But, ah... ... after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own, things started to change. Look, I know he had problems, I understand that.  I've got problems, everybody's got problems.  But I've got a shop to run, I can't let that kind of thing get in the way...  I guess I felt that Ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office.
I don't recall.
No you didn't.  You didn't even ask about Billy.
I can't help but feel somehow... it's my fault.  I keep thinking I could've done something-- stopped it...
Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
I want my son.  I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
Ted, will you take it easy? Revlon's not about to drop an account that represents more than two million in gross billing receipts in a small agency like this, without making us sweat.  Now just relax, okay? Everything's gonna be fine.
Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--
But it doesn't work that way. A major decision was handed down by the Appellate Court in 1969--in the case of Haskins vs. Haskins.
It's a very good job--too good to pass up.  I'll be handling funding for the whole...  Look, I...  ..."like" you a lot.  And you...  ..."like" me, okay?  Maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things would be different...
Look, she walked out on her own child, right?  That's desertion, right? Mr. Shaunessy, I'm telling you it's an open and shut case.
I lost him?  I lost him?
Good Christ, Joanna, just get the hell out of my life.
Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn good life.  She's got a husband that loves her.  She's got a terrific kid.  She's got a wonderful home--
Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.
You heard anything yet?
Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna?
I am sorry, Lhamo.
No.
I do, now.
You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.
Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
General Chiang Chin-wu, the Chinese representative, is en route to Dromo. He is coming to meet you.
Cow.
Me. First break of day.
I will be back in a few days.
May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
In the Pacific Ocean.
What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama?
The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
Has anyone died?
One country did sponsor the resolution. A land called "El Salvador".
I am scared.
I ask them to stop, to lay down their guns.
The pursuit of non-violence. Very difficult.
They will take Lhasa next.
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha. He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption. Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix.
I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
What does the butter spot feel like?
Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.
I do.
The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. Our only hope is to fight.
Did you love your husband, before you married?
Ma'am, how could you not report this?  He puts human life at risk and--
I'll sue you.
You're a beautiful woman.
I really don't mean to be discourteous.  But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England?
You listen to me.  The only reason I'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar--
Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.
What's that?
Gee, that would really disappoint me.
This time, <u>I'm</u> gonna kick your ass.
Well, you can try talking them into that, if--
Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim.
Where?  Where?
<u>Jack</u>!
Eh.  Fuck it.
You're gonna be okay.
He's gonna live?
It really is beautiful, isn't it?
And even if they <u>did</u>, I doubt <u>he</u> or <u>she</u> would have problems with <u>tents</u>.
They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.
I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
Sorry.
I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
What?
Thing we can lift it?
Get him onto shore.
Different worlds, Jack.
No.
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
I'm ready when you are.
Half mile up, there's a clearing.
Hank.  The little cannon you brought, get it.  Guard the shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.
If you get a safe shot...
He's done.  He's dying.
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
And this is how he came to the boat?
Not yet.
You have a thing against museums?
With what?
They don't believe her.
He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped.
Hector, Jack, we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left, and you're on the last tank. Time to go home.
Hank?
Are you okay?
If he gets close, you go <u>up</u>, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.
Should I?
I was working for you when "us" started, what's--
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
This is what we do?
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
Phone call, Clarice. It's God.
Get your field gear, take stuff for overnight. You're goin' with Crawford.
Wear it, don't ever leave it in your purse. Dry fire it whenever you get the chance. And do your exercises.
Do not reach through the bars, do not touch the bars. You pass him nothing but soft paper - no pens or pencils. No staples or paperclips in his paper. Use the sliding food carrier, no exceptions. Do not accept anything he attempts to hold out to you. Do you understand me?
Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -
Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand?
I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?
Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.
I don't know. I didn't see those on any of the other girls...
You seem pretty sure of that.
What would it take?
Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? That slimy little bastard! We were so close with Lecter - and now her last chance is gone.
Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before.
All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would.  I have to go to Belvedere.
I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve, and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric. Where, Starling, he took vocational rehab, and learned a useful trade...
And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?
Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?
No, I came because we need -
Five... so far.
Reasonably so. Yes.
Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he? Apparently he likes you. And you like him, too.
Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
Yes.
A moth... How did you predict that?
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
On what basis would they reject him?
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
What is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing?
I'll listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ?
I heard a strange sound...
What did you do?
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?
Your lambs are still for now, Clarice, but not forever... You'll have to earn it again and again, this blessed silence. Because it's the plight that drives you, and the plight will never end.
Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, she was just ID'd. I met her on a slab in West Virginia. And sometime tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's going to do the same thing to Catherine Martin.
Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.
Yes... I did.
What?!
They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
In this there is a chance. If I live, I can try to free you. If we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them.  Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance. None. I can do nothing. Do you understand?
And my compliments to you...
Will you go back to England?
Where will we go?
You do not know what you are saying!
Some say that's the way of it.
One called Magua arrived.
... compliments, Mr. Poe.  Take her and get out.
Any powder?
Will you men help us stop the French?
Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
I believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us. All they have over us is tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer.  No force on earth will keep me here... Anyone caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each man make your own decision... Those who are goin', be back here in an hour.
I'll cover them from the top of the casement.
A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house. A company of the 33rd will accompany you and Magua will show you the way.
This is the signature of Webb.  And I know the temper of our men. Rather than spend the war in a French prison hulk in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end.
Sergeant Major!
Right - about face! March! First rank present!
Excuse me. What did you say?
Three, four oxen... much wampum.
Yes.
Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua?
Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood.  It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will be buried.
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
Le mot d'ordre?
Not exactly a big ocean country.
That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.
What can we do?
Excuse me, sir...
Charge set?
I'm going inside.
How do you feel, DeJesus?
Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
Forty-eight hours!
I'm telling you, it's the suits!
Still bothering you?
So that's all you do?...
"Routine," my ass!  Ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!
What's going on?
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
Look.  Water.
Excuse me, sir...Bowman's sick.  She's downstairs in the infirmary.
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?
Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
No...he's really sick.  I heard him last night.  The company will take that into consideration...
Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.
I'll kill him!
Yes?
I think he's still alive. He's got claret coming out of him somewhere. What did they want with a traffic warden?
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?
Nope.
It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, Chris?
The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?
They were going to pay, then?
OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?
Jesus, I have heard about him.
We gotta get those guns.
What they like then?
Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have work to do.
And the weed?
Invitations.
Well, what do you want us to do about it?
Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . .
There's nothing in it!
Who's this fat man, then?
I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.
I will.
That you, boy?
What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.
Jews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom.
Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?
You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will move it for you.
My van is half full.
What have you come as?
Where did you get those from, a museum?
The money, the gear!
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
Private Johnson, are you unhappy in the Army?
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
Please.
Do whatever they tell you--
If the incident happened the way you say it did, there hasn't been an infraction.
Did you know he was going to be there last night?
Private Johnson!
Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.
I'm very happy to hear that, Private. Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling okay, too.
Sam the Man.
You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm?
Just wondering.
It's your deal. You sweated it out of him, you pick it up.
That's not the point.
There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.
You still going to all the home games?
Yeah, well--
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
Come on in--
Uncle Al--
It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.
They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
Same as they done in Mexico.
I got a pretty good guess.
Not that I don't think you'd be good at it, but--you know--I wouldn't be disappointed if you decided to do something else with your life.
Maybe we'll clean that thing out back up, have a barbecue next weekend. We could invite him and his wife over.
Recycling, right? We invented that. The government doesn't have to tell people to do it.
What?
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
Since I've been stationed here? A fistfight now and then--
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
Mikey--
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
We been through this before--
And if I get a shot at a promotion somewhere--
It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
Now I'm just as liberal as the next guy--
Black Seminoles?
That where he was shot?
Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
Right.
I gonna meet that family of yours?
Hola, amgio. Problemas de llanta? [Hey, friend. Tire problems?]
Not much, jefe. Some watermelons.
There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection.
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
Is very beautiful, your car.
This girl is a friend of yours?
I thought you were married!
This girl has a child?
"Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, "What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!"
Historic occasion, isn't it?
That's a matter of interpretation--
There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--
Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer--
No.
Charley? I believe he was. Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. What's he got to do with your body?
Sam--
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--
Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
What's she singing about?
That's how I ruined my stomach.
Something wrong?
Your mother still doesn't like me.
I thought you got through that pretty well.
I mean what did we know about anything?
Yeah?
Wow.
Yeah?
I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about--
You're out early.
The Republicans?
Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just a bit slow, is all. He don't mean nothin' by it--
--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.
How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
I've heard a name.  Someone they talk about in whispers.
I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.
Hokey enough for you?
D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know that name?
I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
I'll tell you.
And are you afraid?
Harry.
Are they treating you okay?
I can be very persuasive.
How did it go today?
Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?
Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
So Swann was performing magic. not illusions?  And what?  You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.
You said you weren't with him for love.
Yes.
Are you all right?
Oh God!
I've got to help him.
...yes?
Trickery and divinity.
No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
Philip Swann?
What for?
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever.
You need an ambulance.
The Puritan?
Harry D'Amour.
Are they all in the business?
Look, Ma, no wires.
Oh Jeez.
You think I'm an asshole.
Did she know where Nix was buried?
That's where we're all going.
Can you do it?
Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,
He's not!  He's not!
Yes! Yes!
Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
Hello?
What do you do?
What did you study?
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob  Charlie Brown.
Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs.
No, its easy.
Why do they switch the r's and l's here?
Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
But, I'm mean.
You think so?
Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.
What do you want to drink?
Charlotte?
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Mr. Harris?
Do you like massage?
Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
I don't know.
It's ok.
When are you coming home?
Ok.
How do you say "hospital" in Japanese?
Hello? Yes?
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Character and calling? Is this yours?
I miss you.
Lauren?
Uh..thanks.
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.
What?  That's horrible!
Yeah, like...
It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.
Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
...you wearing a watch, Father?
Yes.
Quiet.  Real quiet...
Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
I can take care of myself.
I've had it.  Townsend's dead.  The police are calling and now I see you having a scene in front of the children. I'm sorry, Maya, you've been with us for many years, but effective immediately, I'm rescinding your right to live at the church.
He spoke to you?
You raised me, like a son.
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.
So...we won?
Yes... and you are?
The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.
So...what did you think of the tape.
You're sure?  There was nothing?
And this is evil?  The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.
Trick him.
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
You okay?
There's nothing else here.
Close call.  For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous.
How much time do we have?
As a part of today's story on the trial of mass murderer George Viznick, we welcome Peter Kelson, author of the current best-seller, VICIOUS INTENT. Thank you for joining us, Peter.
Peter, you're now writing a book about the Viznick case.  You seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers.  I have to ask, how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day, face to face with alleged killers?
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
What's the matter with you?
Thanks again for everything.
It's another day.  I think I'm alright.
We hauled her in earlier but didn't have anything hard to tie her to Townsend. Far as the priest goes, he won't be bothering you.  Suffered a complete mental breakdown, during - get this - during an exorcism.
Monica, what did you do?
Taste this.
What?
I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table.  And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas.  And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.
Which one for tomorrow?
Okay.
When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth?
...and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour.
...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then...
Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
What?
You could've given up after you threw that ball away.  But you kept your head and you showed real heart.
What?
Careful.
I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me.
I don't wanna see that.
So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?
You do.
You ever been in love?
You shoot like a girl.
What's up with that?
You were trying to make me look bad.
I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
So what are these Spanish guys like?
What?  You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?
So how come you could play basketball?
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
What?
So she's honest.
See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
Early night for you, isn't it?
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
You finish the reading for E-con?
What'd it say?
Then prove her wrong.
Give me the ball.
Kiss my booty.
Sorry about your game.
Who was that?
You want to go talk?
You weren't at my game.
Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.
Least she had time for me.
What?
What are the doctors saying?
You visiting?
So...how's the knee?
It just isn't.
What's going on?
I heard enough.
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
There's so many I just can't keep track.
We should head over.
I had some players to see and hands to shake.
Fine, then how many nights home is that?
Just...leave it alone.
Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way.
You don't wanna hurt your back.
Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices.  You don't have a choice.
What are you doing here?
I ain't a damn liar.
I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
Don, you got hit by lightning that time in Tahoe, you went on vacation, I don't think braces is a good idea --
How are you paying tor the braces, Donnie?
It's been the same fuckin' thing for thirty years, Burt --
Hi, hello, great.  This is Seduce and Destroy?
Uh-huh.
What kind of Cancer?
I don't wanna talk to you.
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
Please put your clothes on, please --
...Hello...?
OPEN THE DOOR.
I didn't realize it was that loud.
No.
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now.
Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?
And I bet you say that to all the girls --
...nothing.  I'm sorry...
-- no, like what, what do you mean?
I'll take everything at face value. I'll be a good listener to you.
Just say no.
No, what's wrong?
Diet Coke.
I'm wondering about the weather department. I'm wonderin' wether or not the weather people use outside meteorlogical services or if they have in-house instruments?
What?
What happend, what's going on?
C'mon, Dad.  We gotta just GET HIS MONEY AND GO, LET'S GO. Let's get the money --
GIVE US YOUR MONEY.
I - just - thought - that - I - didn't want - I - didn't - I - didn't -
Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?
-- livin' to get older with a chip on your shoulder 'cept you think you got a grip, cauze you hip gotta holster? Ain't no confessor, so busta, you best just Shut The fuck up, try to listen and learn --
Check that ego - come off it - I'm the profit - the proffesor Ima teach you 'bout The Worm, who eventually turned to catch wreck with the neck of a long time oppressor And he's runnin from the devil, but the debt is always gaining And if he's worth being hurt, he's worth bringin' pain in - When the sunshine don't work, the Good Lord bring the rain in.
-- I told you who did it and you're not listening to me.
What happend?
Just throw some money around. Money, money, money.
-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?
....do you know who I am?
Things go round 'n round, don't they?
I'm sick.
I love you.  I love you and I'm sick.  I'II talk to you....I'll talk to you tommorrow.  I'm getting corrective oral surgery tomorrow.  For my teeth.  For my teeth and for you....for you so we can speak. You have braces.  Me too.  Me too.  I'm getting braces, too.  For you.  For you, dear Brad. And I don't have any money.  And I don't have any money now but I'II get it...I will for you, Brad.  I love you, Brad.  Brad the Bartender.  You wanna love me back?  Love me back and I'll be good to you.  I'II be god damn good for you. And I won't be mad if you don't know who said what. I won't punish you if you get the answer wrong. I can teach and tell you: Samuel Johnson.
Braces?
I've been a good worker --
Give me your keys, Don.
This is the number for Hospice. Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda.  I mean, any sign of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away --
I don't know...I mean, he's around, he's here, in town, y'know, but I don't know...he's a tough one...very.... Do you have a girlfriend, Phil?
And do good things with her...share the thing...all that bullshit is true, y'know...find someone and hold on all that...Where's Linda?
...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...
Do me a personal favor --
...gimme that fuckin' phone...
I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?
This is so boring...so goddamn... and dying wish and all that, old man on a bed...fuck...wants one thing:
That's fine.  It's nice to meet you.
I'm gonna start rolling --
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
-- just to clarify --
Are you asking me that?
C'mon, Frank.  What are you doing?
You're hurting a lot of people, Frank --
the valley?
Does you mother still work?
And your father?
Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you.  We got dissconnected.
He's in here.
Uh. huh.
It's interesting.
So....Phil....um...I think I'm gonna step in and try and see him and say something if he can...talk...I mean:
I'm here.  I'm here now.  What do you want? Do you want anything?
There's no disturbance.
What does it look like?
I didn't do anything.
Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you to have a new attitude with me.  The more you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna become that you've been up to something.
This is the LAPD. If anyone is back here I want you to come out and I want you to show yourself to me with your hands in the air --
Thirty fuckin' years I've been with Rose, don't -- y'know -- with this, and I know what you think --
Are you gonna tell her what you've done?
Rose is on the phone and here's the cards for today --
I'm gonna need a full name, Stanley.
That's it.
No.
Just once.
You deserve to die alone for what you've done.
I'm Bob.
Was it a call back?
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
You should get one, I'm serious, you could get a lot of stuff out of this --
You don't want any water?
I don't want him to die, I didn't love him when we met, and I've done so many bad things to him that he doesn't know, things I want to confess to him, but now I do: I love him. I love him so much and I can't stand -- he's going.
Where will the money go?
Linda --
Pink Dot.
The fuck is wrong with you?
C'mon, man.
You have to be nicer to me, Dad.
..sorry...
You know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me with a belt, Stanley....  I'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if I don't, I come home without the money....
What is that?
God smiled upon us.
What is it, mother?
Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!
How can I serve you in this?
I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.
What are they doing?
Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?
The Prison of Belle Sur.
Who is he, Aramis?
Where are you going?!
But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time, but --
But --
Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.
Perhaps.  But of d'Artagnan I am certain.  What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King.
Once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river.
I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.
It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.
Athos, do you understand this?  He confuses me --
But why?
Aramis... These are... these are whores!
But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.
D'Artagnan.  Perhaps you should accept his offer, for we are dead anyway.
Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?
Die?  What...?
This cannot be.  Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king!
Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen.
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?
Phillippe...?
A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, "What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?"  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting.
I already know about the riots, d'Artagnan, I heard them out there whispering.  Some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food.  I will deal with it tomorrow.
What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --
Magnificent valor...
Exactly why it should be given away.
Did you know... about Raoul?
We're by Ozone...
What do you think?
Bullshit...
What the hell is this Marvosa!!
Did you hit him?
I'll take the south end -
Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
Something wrong with you Marvosa?
Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!
I tell you one thing Trudell - you'd make a hell of a cop...
The guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole...
I was just having a little fun -
Zydowski.  It's about time.
What?  Wait a minute -
Where is he?!!
Where up north?
Mind if I turn out the light?
No, but I'm listening.
You are drunk.  You know, it's been a long time and I'd love to catch up, but I really got to -
Holy shit -
I've got a better idea...
So...what happened to you, Jimmy?  I figure you'd be in some far off place somewhere, living on the edge like the good old days.
Tubbs, these people mean business.
Are you a regular there?
I wouldn't presume to try.
Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked.  So do I.  What do you want?
I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box.  When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy?'  That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown.
Sidney: I don't understand him.  We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience.  To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming'... but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming.  The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me.  Why the mirrors?
The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply.
How long do I have?
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you?
That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
You look all right now.
...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
Run it.
Who is it?
Get me a plane!
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
That's why the boltcutter.
What's being photographed?
Is that you. D?
I'll get my purse.
Do you want a Coke or something, Reba?
No. Reba...?
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
What am I doing here?
Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds?
Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds?
Do you see?
'No' what?
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
Can you read it to me?
She'll be in, in the morning...
Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
'Intimate? !"
If I were?
Can I have one of your cigarettes?
And... where are things?
What will you do?
What's this Mama shit?
Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too...
It's a precaution...  Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.
I figured I'd ask you...
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
Yes, I thought so.
Yes.
Do you have the file with you
You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you?
May I keep the file?
No.
Kevlar Second Chance.
Hey, I really enjoyed your set.
I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
Oh dear!  George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break.
You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"
They're having a laugh...
So how can I help you...?
Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
What do you want?  "Take my wife, please"??
Maybe I should talk to the natives.  Shoom boom boo ba!  Shoom boom boo ba --
Andy... uhh... this network has a long-standing policy: The viewer must be able to see the program.
Five.
Cue the commercial!
Excuse me -- ?
Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously.  It was just part of the show!  It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.
Popcorn?
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
You're not listening to me --
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
So?  What do they know?
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
I was very original!
Excuse me, Andy...
Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
It's a perfect Kaufman audience.
Bob Gorsky.
We'll need a search running.
Who is it?
I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.
Did you hear that?
There's something about him, isn't there?
You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this.
Do you always look at it encoded?
You bet your ass.  It keeps him going.  Maybe it keeps all of us going.
Five.  Since I've been here.
Operator.
Give me your phone.
Right now?
No!  It's too far away.
Do you still want to meet?
Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.
No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!
How did I beat you?
I know what you're trying to do --
Do you know why you didn't make it?
How does she know?
Did you believe in them too?
Hello?
Hello, Neo.
Do you want to go somewhere and talk?
It's the question that brought you here.  You know the question just as I did.  It is a hacker's question.
From what?
What does that mean?
But an Oracle can.
Should I be?
Are you all right?
What is it?
Is Morpheus alive?
No, you... have to be.
What?
What are you doing?
Neo, how did you do that?
Holy shit!
Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...
It's locked.
Operator.
Isn't this Jack Groppi's place?
What are your plans?
It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?
Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.
Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...
Look at her.
So?
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
Don't promise...just deliver.
Let's get out of here.
Keep your mouth shut.
Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you.  We've been in here calling...
Johnny, I swear to God, if you open your mouth about any of this...
You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?
Back so soon.
I think we should see your uncle.
Hey...you're here.  They told me you're here...and you're here.  How are you?
Oh great...hey - Winstons?
No...I'll be ok for a week.
Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
$500.  He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's almost $3,000.
He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...
Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...
Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  They know where to come when they need us.  I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks...
Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them?  Lock her up?
See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place.
No.
Bore.
I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
...He must have heard the name from those T.V.'s in the hall that were blaring all the time.  I remember GUEVARA was in town at the time. Must've heard it from there I guess...but that's funny, isn't it?
The building on the corner.  That one!  He's been on the roof a half hour now!
Are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight?
Lower the fuckin music--I can't hear nothin.
Come on.
How much?
...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?
Dinner?  Again?
Did you speak to the Governor?
His wife?
That was 'Joe'.
Did he?  That's more than we get to do.
Have you got a minute?
I hate parties --
I know you do, darling.
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---
From the Korean War.
I wasn't going to say --
Honey, please.
What about the Mayor?
And that?
Bill, thanks for coming over...  And how're you doing today, Drew?  You've got a firecracker here, the kid's really set the table.
Left field somewhere.  Well, Bill, I want to come in from the outfield, bat cleanup like you have, learn the plush ropes --
-- Did I hear 'business'?
We're not getting anywhere here. Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --
Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?
Hot or cold.
It doesn't matter.
No.
Perhaps you could remind me.
I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop --  Instead it was --
So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?
Have we met?
Shall we adjourn?
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day.  Need a few minutes to sort everything out.
What is there to say?  They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.
What are their feelings?
Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.
Yeah.
He was interested.
I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right?
Jennifer.
'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.
Black.
That's very gracious of you, Quince.
No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
I've got plenty of friends.
Oh goodness, no.
I came to see you.
She's in a great deal of pain.
I mean I appreciate that.
Has her pain abated?
Why?
...No.
For how long?
Well -- I --
Did I say that?
Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --
No --
Joe, that's the kitchen.
So there's nothing between you and Susan?
Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
How about giving a guy a break?
There's one to every rule.
-- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?
...I'd like to be alone for a while.
Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something.  I know I'll be seeing you.
Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.
Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.
I'll be the judge of that.
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
I told you to shut up.
Am I dreaming this?  Are you a dream?
I didn't ask any question.
Are you giving me orders?
Please.  Talk to me --
What is this, a joke, right?  Some kind of elaborate practical joke? At my 40th reunion, we delivered a casket to the Class president's hotel room and --
The great Bill Parrish at a loss for words?  The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --
'Take me'...?  Where?
Get what?
What the hell are you talking about?
We're all here, Bill --
Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --
Drew told me.
I don't like to interfere.
That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
Daddy, what's the matter?
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
I don't know, I can't say --
I love him.
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
Nothing lasts.
I've got patients coming in --
You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days --
Why?
You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?
Where'd you get it?
Jimmy?
I wrote an address in there, too. Might be useful. It's this abandoned place outside of town. I guy I know used to use it for his bigger deals.
They treating you alright?
So I just take your word?
It's not easy to be calm when -
What are you gonna do?
Yeah, I hated it.
Me? Why would he be interested in me?
Why would you do that?
What does he want?
You don't know, do you? You're blissfully ignorant, aren't you?
What happened?
Calm down.
They're not looking for him.
Dying.
Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me?
This is your car.
Yup?
I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -
Unfinished business.
Why's that?
Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
I didn't sell -
Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
How do you know this?
He knew about Sammy. Why would I tell him about Sammy?							  *
What difference does it make whether he			* was your guy or not?						    *
So who are you saying he was?					*
It is now.
No.  I was in Namibia...
Yeah.
Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
She's sending a message.  Meth Lab. Trailer park.  Anything with interesting antenna arrays...?
He is fine.  And we know the jokes. When it gets vengeful, things get messy.  When they get messy the wrong people die...  Everybody gets it.
You need to consider a few issues.
So...?
I got the item.
When?
Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
I insist.
Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can.
Yero, by himself?
How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours?
What's our deal?
And we didn't come down here to audition.  Business auditions for us...  ...and know who we are and know they want their load run by us <u>before</u> Nicholas calls.
People gonna walk into this place and say, "Ola, hijo!  That some crazy wallpaper.  Whew...it wild! Is that a Jackson Pollack?"
And specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs.
Then it don't work.
What do we got?
You're not makin' a move on her...?
There is "undercover."  And there is "Which way is up?"
Go ahead.
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
Guy's involved in a "meet"...
So what do you want?
Who said, "go exploring"?  We want this staying on track.
Out of...?
On the phone.
I gave up nothing on you guys. Don't worry.  I kept you and Rico out of it.  Only the Feds.  They're on their own...it's all their deal, anyway, so fuck 'em.
Alonzo...!
As in, your ass is dead in the water.
Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them?
Who are you talking to?
Nothing.  Calling to say hi... What's up with you?
You mean with the flowers...?
...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
And...?
It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. Jos knows that...  Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story.
So lay it out, my brother...
And violence is extra.  And expensive.  So how much weight you looking to move?
What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
What...?
You sure you heard what I said?
You ain't coming to work?
Must be some mess back there.
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
Maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens?
For money.
What for?
I drug in a cot, if you want to stay.
Joe -- do me one favor -- this is my place, am I wrong? You know, in my own place my name ain't Ratso. I mean it so happens my name is Enrico Salvatore Rizzo.
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
What'll happen. I mean what they do to, you know, do with you -- if you can't -- ah, Christ!
You get your first palm tree in South Carolina.
What you got me up here for?
I'm going to Florida.
Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?
This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built? Ten bucks she wanted. Three of us made a deal for, twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain?
You got that, shit face? Asina...
It's there!
What?
Who?
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.
--the water like "'weeps" through the cement, see. Twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over. All we do is use Gastrohead's screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out. Pull out 2, 3 stones, squeeze through, put 'em back, and get our ass down the shaft, It's a two night operation, maybe three.
Yeah. How's Mom?
Why'd you do it, Billy?
DAD!
Sixty Lira?
Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
Just what?
What's your father do?
Feeling all right?
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
Best way is get your ass out... any... way... you can...
Okay?
Max, sit down. You're in no shape to kill anybody.
It's already been cut.
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
Why the suit?
I think I've been poisoned.
Billy, what's the matter?
Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you.  And you must fuck last.
You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back. 
The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
Funny.  Shoulda seen some track bunnies by now.
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
Wait a minute-
Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...
Is there a switch?
My God, what the hell are you...?
What are you putting that crap on me for?
Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code...
A shame.  You looked great tonight.
This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!
We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!
It worked before...
Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes, try not to sweat.  They can sense chemical changes...
Talk to me.
Hello.
It bit you.
Here.
Shouldn't I be in a hospital?
You're very kind...
No, what is it?
Thank you so much.
Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan.
I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?
I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again.
Don't get me wrong. I'm not against marriage per se. But it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again.
What are you doing on the floor?  It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in.  I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?
See, isn't this nice?
And I got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker--on account of it's missing an "n." I told the saleslady "n" was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name.
Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?
Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.
To celebrate Misery's return. I couldn't have done it without you.
I hope you like it.
I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it?
Annie, what is it?
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
Paul, I know you've been out.
Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.
The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place.  Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
Oh, Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne? You have to tell me.
Just leave it, all right?
That thing.  Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.
Yes.
No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him...
I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him.
Answer me a couple things?
Newspapers?
- pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it's potential evidence..
Your room.
You won.
See anything you like?
Sort it all out.
Nyah!
Fight a bit of a cold..
What you got there, mate?
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
- this is very disconerting..
Under the circumstances I think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load.  How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..
Hola..
They've got a book for this?
So where did I got right?
Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.
Before you are.
He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.
Have you met them?
I managed.
I want <i>you out of there.</i>
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you.  Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what?  Two, three times?
Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it.
Right now only Ambrose knows that.
In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.
Very.
- good.  Then if you manage to get hold of Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got -  - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera on earth.
But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
No, I don't.  But in this case -
I don't.  No exactly.
..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.
So what did he say?
You have Bellerophon.
You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
The man's gone black, Barnes.  He's under until he decides to surface.
That's S.O.P..
You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened.
You knew about Jim?
Well Claire do you?  Have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
Is he serious?
I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this.
What?
What are you going to do?
We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
Go ahead.
<u>Are you intact</u>?
I dont think so.
Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?
Correct the actual list is safe at Langley.  "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, one of ours.
Reach your folks?  How they feeling?
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
On what?
Very good.
What was your deal with Job?
I gotta go in there and shut it down!
Jack.  Jack.
Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Im coming to you.
He won't be back in a hurry?
- so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
Arent you going to thank me Jim.  Ten million is better than six.
No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now?
Why don't you take a look?
Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
Whats the problem.
Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened.
Are you ready?
I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr. Johnny.
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
You're welcome.
Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.
Rose, pass the wine.
Hi.  Hi.
I have my eyes open.
I don't know what you mean.
You're married.
What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs.
At dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me. Things are very bad in my house.
Have you come from my brother?
How'd he die?
Why?
I don't know.
How many men since then?
To the bed.
I'm marrying your brother!
What did I do?
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
Why not?
So. Where are we sitting?
No thanks.
This is your place.
I'm afraid of who I am.
Let me go home.
I got things to do.
What's the matter? You look crazy.
It's Johnny Cammareri.
What's the matter?
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
What about the wedding?
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
Yeah.
Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the deathbed of my mother.
Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.
What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
I don't wanna talk about it.
He's with his dying mother!
I... a... slept with my fianc's brother.
I know.
Alright.
Don't fight.
Don't make yourself sick.
No idea.
Loretta...
Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?
I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
Temperature's dropping.
It's Cosmo's moon.
So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.
Well, this is a temperate zone.
Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings four hundred and ninety three times every second.   right?
Am I right?
What word?
None shall pass.
Then you shall die.
I move for no man.
Victory is mine.  I thank thee O Lord that in thy ...
You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.
I'll do you for that.
Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
Well ... can we come up and have a look?
What is your name?
Who are you? TALL KNIGHT We are the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
What?
What?
What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...
... But all the decision of that officer ...
I'm averting my eyes, Lord.
Make a bridge out of her.
Nothing... There's your ninepence.
I think I'll go for a walk.
I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir.
Oh dear, I didn't really mean to...
It's just that when I'm in this genre, I tend to get over-excited and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ...
Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing.  All I had when I started was swamp ...  other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp.  So I built a another one ... that sank into the swamp.  I built another one ...  That fell over and THEN sank into the swamp ....  So I built another ... and that stayed up. ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island.
But I don't like her.
But, Father.
No ...  You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.
If we ... er ... 
Make sure he doesn't leave.
Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot, from the Court of Camelot.  I have come to take you ...  away ... I'm terribly sorry ...
Well ... yes ...
You tit.  I soiled my armour I was so scared!
What's he do?  Nibble your bum?
He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ...
So?
How much?
Sixty.
Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
One box of biscuits, one box of drop tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen chocolate sponges.  It's the same order every week, but does anybody bother to check it?  Now she has to travel all the way to Balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys.
She's got an army of people to get her up and out.
Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.
My lips may give a message better of Christmas love than e'en this letter.  To my best friend, J.B. from his best friend, V.R.  Best friend!
I wish to see my mother.
Convey her a message.
Mother....
Surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop...
The order of seating at the Upper Servant's table is arranged personally by the Queen herself.
I'm sorry?
Was there never ambition?
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
So...?
They don't see it.
Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.
My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.
If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two.
I am told so.
Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.
Duty?!  You talk about duty?!
You should never have gone out in such foul weather.
A distinct flushing around the cheeks. She was drunk, I tell you.
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
Why?
What's the riddle?
The next half of the game takes place in ARCADE's brain, The City of Truth. It's urban scenarios, lots of metal and concrete. Screamer comes faster here.  On Level Four you can get a free life if you wait until the last possible second before exiting that world.  Gotta time it right though.
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
Liar.  Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?
See, men always do this.  "Quiet down, honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick!  I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!
We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone...
Where to now?
This is like a movie or something.  I mean, am I paranoid or what?
That's what I thought.
It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.
You feel it?  It's different this time.
Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.
So how did you do it, Alex?
How did you get here?  Did you play the game?!
I'm thinking!
A man after my own heart.  Straight to the point.  What's different about ARCADE is the way it reacts.  It responds like a human does.  It learns.  It adapts. Each time you play, it changes its strategy.
"Escape"?
Cool.
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
What do you mean "you know"?
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
So what's the problem?
Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
I understand.
... What??
Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
Get going. You don't want to be late.
Was anyone hurt?
What is it Rita?
Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about?
No.... I don't...
Strange to be calling yourself.
What's wrong with that?
Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!
Rita... I want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money.
Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner.
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
Not here...no thanks.
That's it folks for the Demon Boat Ride.... Everybody off. Watch your hands and feet.
Is that it ?
Good morning. What do you have today ?
How do we get out of this room ?
So what do we do ?
McCay knows ?
What are you doing ?
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
It was there, clear as day. I saw the computer records. Matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal account.  I just knew something was wrong.
I don't get it.
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
NO ! Don't open ANY of them ! They're all wrong. Just wait.
Give me one good reason why I don't plug you right here, right now ? 
Is it over ?
Be very, very quiet...
You okay ?
Where ?
Never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes. His file says he is an avid jogger.
Stop the hydraulics.
I made my bones on the street, you know. I did Riglioni in his own house. I was made in the Family, okay.
Any priors ? Any police record ?
Parking tickets ? That's it ?
Relax, son. They'll learn in time that you don't fuck with First Bank. This is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong Survive.
Zach, how old are you, son ?
What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?
Do you think the assistant, what's his name...
Is it as good as I hope it is ?
One moment dear... 
How long till the drug wears off ?
What's next ?
Look ! Look !
Was that the Old Man ?
So what's next ? No one's ever made it this far before.
What the ... ?
Listen, I was thinking, you know. Would you go, it's I think you're...
Really ? On a date ?
I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.
Are you okay ? Any holes ? I mean aside from the one's that nature gave you ?
No sir. I was just getting , well you know. Water. We weren't talking about sex or anything else except Star Wars. Just saying hello. I think I'm gonna go now.
No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
Excuse me I asked you a question.
Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per family, that way you don't lose your room.
Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
No nuns, got it.
Hi honey.
Can I see him?
Never heard of him. 
She can spread her wings, right here in Pennsylvania. You don't send a child alone to Los Angeles, she could come back with her ears pierced, her legs shaved and God knows what else.
His name's Harry Sultenfuss.
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
Umm...can you come in for a minute?
Oh she's great...she's a little crazy though. Anyway, Hillary said that you had a black Ford truck and this policeman I know got in touch with Motor Vehicles and...he gave me your address and here I am.
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
Maggie wanted to have a baby...and...umm...I didn't.
I know that.
What are you staring at?
Oh please, who do you think you're kidding? And where did she spy on the Russians from, here in Pennsylvania??
Your mother?
If the fruit burst into flames I'll be prepared.
You're grounded 'till you're fifty!
Getting off please.
Vada.
It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.
Care for a smoke?
If he has a heart attack you're carrying the body down yourself.
Hey what do I care...I mean, consider the sorts, a chick from Pennsylvania, who wears a mood ring.
Come and get it.
Just come and get it...right here!
You mean,  this ring?
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
Hey look!
Yeah I guess...sort of.
It's not his fault!
What's it for?
Doctor Helburn, what a surprise. In the last couple of days we've changed your oil, realigned your brakes, balanced and rotated your tires, aligned your front end, and flushed out your entire cooling system, I really didn't expect to be seeing you for another three thousand miles.
Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.
Vada!! Vada runs and jumps into Phil's arms Look at you, oh hi, hi, hi!! How are you? You look great, how's Shelly? Your dad?
I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
No, there's no problem, Dr. Helburn just needs to have his oil changed.
Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.
I'm just tired.
I mean...with your car.
Excuse me?
Something wrong?
Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me.
I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
I would have tried to show her a good time. I promised her when she left that I would never forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.
The boss is watching us...
This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada Sultenfuss...
Ex...ex, ex...
Stiffs??
I need the job.
Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common.
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
Harry?  I was just wondering, if there is anything wrong with Vada.
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
I just had a terrible thought Harry.
Kinda like men.
I had a good time tonight.
Home sweet home.
I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.
This is where we are.
Did you ahh, love him?
Vada, we're trying to work here.
Of course not.
Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.
Dad??
Goodnight Vada.
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
Why?
That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
No, no no....
Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?
Really? Already? The summer's just begun.
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.
My Dad was funny?
Who's winning?
He's allergic to everything.
Hi.
Big Ringo fan.
Do you like putting makeup on people?
Where's Daddy?
Goodnight.
Oh great!
It's a mosquito bite.
What's wrong with your eyes?
Woah!!
Have you ever kissed anyone?
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in.  It's who I leave out.
Blood oath.
He can't do that to me!
I give.
Needing.
But I can't be dry.
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.  Right from the start.
... luckiest guy in the Northern Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s...
I'm excited Sports Illustrated gave him this kind of shot, he's only there a ye...
But he sure can kiss.
It's not just clubs.  This guy always knows the best everything. The best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best Horowitz record, was he always like the...
Exactly what?
Who?  The jerk who's running your life?
Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...
I never want to go through this again.
Ex-cuse me?
If he gives you grief, I'll have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show.
It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.
Luckily.  The closer I watched, the more the fault came into focus.  Each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability.
She's too genuine.
Waiter! Check, please!
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...
No problem.  A little bullshit about Daddy's "needs," and presto, I'm a lap dog in high society.
No accents today.
It's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s...
Michael? What ha...
Isabelle?  I need to talk to Kim...
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
Well.  How come she didn't...
... your one chance for true happiness?
Jules, what's wrong...
Uh.  I saw that moving...
Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...
He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust...
All of a sudden, I'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans I had for my life...
You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now. December 9th, to be exact.
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
You're from out of town?
I don't want to listen to her sing -
Well, I guess you caught me at a weak moment.
Yes.
You want anything?  A drink?
Where'd he ever see us?
It's an appearance. It has nothing to do with support. I don't even like him.
You're kidding.
Come on. He's a crook.
You want me to wait?
My wife and I think so, but we're family. Your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. What do you do, pick or sing?
Well, I could use one, especially if I'm pregnant.
You must really like him.
You got a place to stay?
Mom?
I don't know his first name.
Fungus?
Have your children been deaf since birth?
Yes. Who's this?
Who is this?
Oh.
Oh?
Wrong.
How old are you?
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Just got out. Had me thirteen lawyers. Missed the electric chair twice. .. Been out three months. Are you heavy?
I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
All I need is fifteen minutes a night.
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
Yes.
What time?
What for?
Where are you going?
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
No  Hell, some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the box.
Probably a little too long.
Pleasure
Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.
Southern California.
It's not bad.
Don't you think they'd just love another song instead?
More or less.
When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?
Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?
Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole. Got it?
By all means, knock yourself out.
Divine intervention.
Who is we?
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
You're a breathing icon of justice and that's why you were chosen to deliver Mr. and Mrs. Knox. We, the prison board we, knows that once you get them on the road if anything should happen, an escape attempt, an accident, fire, anything...Jack 'Supercop' Scagnetti would be there to look out for his public's best interests.
Yeah.
What I'd like to do---
Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about.
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory.  What's up here?  What's in here?
You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.
Yeah baby.
Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
Hypnotizing.
Yes.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there?
Now we got to film a new intro for the follow up episode. But we put the intro for the first episode at the beginning temporarily so you can see it with some scope.
Roger, no.
We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes.
So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and planning the interview.  You two go down to the editing bay, take the old footage and the new footage, put it together, and see what we got. Get it into shape so when we finish the interview, we can just stick it in.
How's it working, Scotty?
Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.
But you see, that's okay, Wayne.
I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here.
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
It sure is.
Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?
We got one...two...three...four ...five...six...seven...eight. I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too much. Let's lose some of these guys.
Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.
No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.
How 'bout that furniture plant?
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
What's the matter, boy? Never smile?
Yeah.
James Lee, you come in here and meet your daddy.
Well, she never gave me none. Look, you better find him a place pretty quick.
That's right.
So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?
Hell!
But I would like to see you again.
I wouldn't have let you.
No, on the porch.
What?
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
At first it was real strange. Hell, Japan is a long ways from Alabama. Really got under my skin, though. Almost didn't come back.
Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I' been thinkin'.
I can see why.
That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.
Hmmm - good coffee.
Ain't that something?!  That's just fine, baby.
About ten dollars.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
Day work.
Don't do that!
Hell, if they don't blow up his place, they'll get him some other way. Don't make no difference no-how.
Ain't you goin' to say something?
Where're you going to go?
We was just leavin', fellows.
Good-bye, Frankie.
They all got families to support.
How about a drink?
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?
Want me to hold the light for you?
That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.
Come back some other time, will you?
Come on, Pop.
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
Well, what're you going to do?
Going back, huh?
They'll run you out.
Hello.
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.
No. Why?
Let's go.
Your Raoul?
Omar, your wife's here.  Ny superiors: will allow me to make the trade now.  But I gotta see that you haven't hurt the other hostages.  If you haven't, I'11 take the girl and send in your wife.
Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
We got any shots?
Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?
Let me get you another glass of wine.
Easy...
A little incestuous, but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?
Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.
Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
Why'd you do it, Armitage?
That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
What are you talking about?
And then?
Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream.
You find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes.
An odd selection, Mr Case.
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
I saw your girl yesterday.
Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
We're doing fine. Take the next right.
Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.
Four men. Babylon soldiers.
What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
Bright enough to be dangerous.
Where the hell have you been?
Yo.
One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
Wait... You hear that?
Case... are you okay?
I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.
Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
You've been calling her name.
How long have I been out?
I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me.
When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down, that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me, figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
I know.
I'm still going in.
How are you at riddles, Peter?
Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
It is?
What?
Gus, have you ever been in love?
Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
Anita!
Okay. That's bad.
And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
You need my help?
Wings?
Oh-my-God. You totally ripped off my Malibu Barbie idea.
I think it's pronounced gauche.
: Wait. Do you know any gay guys?
You've done five of my ideas.
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
Responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call "The Court." Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, "Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night."
Hey there.
Maybe we should go in a different room?
You having fun?
You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.
Hey Rob, what's going on?
That is so--weird that you name your car.
Better person than I.
It was a long time ago -
Are mom and dad here?
These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.
Really?  Rob-, that girl is sixteen.
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
Whoa. Deja Vu.
You have to say that. You're my student.
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
told him  --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
No, I'm alone.
I don't know.
Aloha! Welcome!
Are you having fun?
Good. Gibby gave me champagne.
Shock.
<i>                                   ... Let's draw straws.</i>
The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally... I thought I'd find you here....
What trail are you trying to throw me off now?
Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
You remember your dreams, Grady?
Oh Jesus.  I'm gonna be sick.
You're wasting your time, the guy's a basket case.
Are you nuts or something?
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.
No, that's okay.  I was just...unpacking.
No. Never.  You think that's what it is?
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
What about "essential energy" the soul.  Does that go into the air too?  You think there's a good energy and a bab energy?
What is this place?
Well, what am I supposed to do?
About not finding any bogey men?
I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.
Oh, Christ, you're hurt...
Morning.
We're going up to bed now.
Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
Oh, right.  You're gonna be a TV star.
What's happening?
To old friends.  And your new dreams.
Have you ever done that before?  Pulled someone into your dream?
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?
We're not always as good at things as we'd like.
Oh yeah?  Well, if you're ever in the mood for a history lesson, I'm your teacher, understand?
The whole wing's devoted ot this program.  That's your office.
This is Phillip.  We call him The Walker.
Max, where's Kristen?
Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
Fred Krueger's dead.  You always had a little trouble understanding that, Princess.
My mother's dead.  Died in her sleep.
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
To who?
Stop blaming yourself.
We can try again.
We made it.  Neil, we made it!
We'll begin sedation tonight.  Starting with him.
We've got work to do.
What was that?
Somebody else is out here.
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
You do volunteer work at the hospital?
This wing's been closed for years.  What was this place?
I'm sorry, Neil.  You brought this on yourself.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
What do you think of the guinea fowl?
Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?
Here we go.
Probably best not tell anyone about this.
Hello.  Hi.  Hi.
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
Hi.
I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
Whoopsidaisies.
No, I didn't.
Here we are.  Do you want to come up?
To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
What?
I don't know what happened.
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
This is certainly... ah...
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
You were saying...
Liar.  She hates surprises.  What are you ordering?
Can I have your autograph?
That's right.
Where are you going?
Yes.
Yup.
I just want to say to Tony -- don't take it personally.  The more I think about things, the more I see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us...
Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
Bloody hell, this is fun.
Bernie -- this is Anna.
Have we got something for you. Something which will make you love me so much you'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life.
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
'Horse and Hound.'  The name's William Whacker.  I think she might be expecting me.
Well, fire away.
Well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making it.
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
Max.  This is Anna.
So -- you've laid the ghost.
I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.
Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
Well, okay.  There's this girl...
Spike.
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
No -- they're... for my grandmother. She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.
Bad news.
But you have no proof.
Why?
You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!
Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
Easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got lots of games ahead of us...
My name is Miss Ratched. I'm the head nurse here. You've already met Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington and Warren.
Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here.
How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
Miss Ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? She's comin' down from Portland.
Whatcha boys playin'?
Y-y-yes! Yes! Y-y-y-you s-s-saw wh wh-what she c-c-can do to us!
That's okay, kid...
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy.
Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there!
Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...
Ahhh, Billy...
Hey, Cheswick! Wake up!
Where's Martini and Scanlon?
Which gets you shipped up to Disturbed for a nice little zap job.
What? What?
Mine, too!
Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe anyway?
I'll bet a dollar.
Did to me?
Okay, sucker.
I said out!
Let me see your hand!
Why not?
Big king, too bad...
Big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? Ya hit or sit, Martini?
Whadaya doin', there's no one there!
Gimme the ball!
I wanna go home!
Man, there sure is an awful lot of poontang around here.
Oh, what's that?
Poker!
Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
I don't, Doc...
Pardon me miss, but would you mind turning...
It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...
Shhh... Remember this is a privilege, so I don't want none of you goons fuckin' up. Kay?
Yeah, buddy?
Got a cigarette?
No!
What you boys doin' up at this ungodly time o' the night?
Hey, how ya doin', cutie?
Please follow me.
Okay, Mack!  Whoowe, Candy girl, are we in an insane asylum or ain't we?
He's a patient, Rose...
Who is he?
Hi.
Yeah!
Maybe I'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, Sefelt.
Make yourself at home, Mister McMurphy...
Hey, Sam, bet ya two bucks ya lose.
The lights were flashing on and off, Mister Turkle.
Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
Your mother.
May I see your boarding pass, please?
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
Oh, right.  Dwayne.  You're engaged to Dwayne?
What?
Who's dying?
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
You're limping.
Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?...  Just tell me what it is, I'll say it.  I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
It's in the south.  I've still got my rental car.  I can get you there by morning...
I'm sorry.
Yes.  I am.
There's no such thing.
I don't know what you're talking about.  Who told you that?
Alright.  The truth is... I thought we had something here.
Don't you think you're overreacting just a little here?   We're talking about love, okay?  Let's be rational.
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
Very funny.
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...
You're Damon Bradley?
Hello.
Been here long?
You know, I noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke.  I could sense the chemistry between us.
What looks good?
I don't believe in statistics.
I wish you didn't have to go so early.
Is that bad?...
Have you seen him with someone?
It's a miracle.
I have vacation time coming to me.
No, I haven't.  And you forgot about the fortune teller.
Thank you so much.
Live happily ever after.
We're saved!
Your brother?
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
I think it's time we got some professional help.
Hi-iii...
Why?
I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.
Amazing...
Joan Collins stayed here.
Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  Can you tell us what she's saying?
A porco?
Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.
It was an emergency.  I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her.  I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
And then I saw her.  And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
I'm gonna take her home first.
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
It'll do.
I make it twentysix twenty-three. You're fifty short, Skins.
I wish I knew.
But my own kid bro
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
Mmhmmm.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
Take the boss loading, kid. For God's sake. I don't want to hurt you.
See! You don't understand!
It was you, Charley... .
Time and faith... . My brother's dead and you stand there talking drivel about time and faith.
Father Barry.
Terry...?
It's quite  nice.
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
Our Lord said just the opposite.
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or or human kindness in your whole body.
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.
Jimmy...
My pigeons... .
Who is he! Edie, you're so softhearted and soft-headed you wouldn't recognize the devil if he had you by the throat. You know who this Terry Malloy is? The kid brother of Charlie the Gent, Johnny Friendly's right hand, a butcher in a camel hair coat.
Pop, don't think I'm not feeling grateful for all you've done to get me an education and shelter me from this.  But now my eyes are open. I see things I know are so wrong how can I go back and keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people aren't living? I'm staying, Pop. And I'm going to keep on trying to find out who's guilty for Joey. I'd walk home with a dozen Terry Malloys if I thought they could help me. I tell you I'm staying, Pop. Pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers.
It started as a favor for my brother you know they'd ask me things and it's hard to say no a favor Who am I kiddin'? They call it a favor but it's do it or else. And this time the favor turned out to be helping them knock off Joey. I just thought they'd lean on him a little but Last night with Edie I wanted to tell her only it stuck in my throat. I guess I was scared of drivin' her away and I love her, Father. She's the first thing I ever loved.
Conscience... .  I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
Who asked him here?
Now listen, if you know who the pistols are, if you see them on the dock every day, are you going to keep still until they cut you down one by one?  Are you? Are you? How about you, Nolan?
D 'n D?
You all right, Nolan?
Nice fellows.
You're Terry Malloy, aren't you?
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.
Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.
You can bring a lawyer if you wish. And you're privileged under the Constitution to protect yourself against questions that might implicate you in any crimes.
Listen, this ain't for publication.
Some chance at ten percent a week! And if he don't borrow, he don't work.
You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.
Give me a double.
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
I I musta counted wrong, boss, I
I know, Johnny, I know... .
Do you?
Go on a little present from your Uncle Johnny.  And Mac, tomorra mornin' when you shape the men put Terry in the loft. Number one. Every day.  Nice easy work. Check in and goof off on the coffee bags. O.K.?
Nothing happened, he says. Some operator you got yourself there, Charley. One more like him and we'll all be wearing striped pajamas.
Guts! A crummy pigeon who's looking to get his neck wrung!  You should have  You should have known better than to trust this punched out brother of yours. He was all right hanging around for laughs. But this is business. I don't like goofoffs messing in our business.
I'm glad what I done today, see? You give it to Joey, you give it to Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of your own. You thought you was God Almighty instead of a cheap connivinggood-for-nothing bum! So I'm glad what I done you hear me? glad what I done!
From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing over here now. I was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an'... .
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
You see, Kayo, the good Lord watches over us after all.
The brother of Charley the Gent. They'll help us get to the bottom of the river.
Something's making that music.
Not dead?  In a cemetery?
What can we do?
That sudden?
Well?
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
They are live ones?
We don't know of anything, Master...
Ahh, the curiousity of youth... on the road to ruin!  May it ever be so adventurous!
No. No! No!
He wants us.
Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
I could make her another Cleopatra...
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?
I'm getting ready to go out.  You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?
I talk to the guy you work for, Emil. He tole me your number and where you live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you.
I'm not dressed.
Wait in the hall!  I have to get dressed!
Where in the hell are we?
Do we need him?
Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.
Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.
Yeah?  You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us?
My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth.
You know they gonna set us up.
I'm going back inside.
Shut up.
Leave it where it is.
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
How much for your company at chow?
Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. He's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system.
Why you're just a girl.  What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?
Boy, it stunk in there.
How many was that?
You don't act like it.
It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.
We still talk, though.
That part in the movie where they get shot?  Warren Beatty and... I can't think of her name.
Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked, <i>Three Days of the Condor</i>.
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.
Is that how you think of yourself?
Not yet.  Don't say anything yet.  Okay?
If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.
I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.
You getting serious on me now?
So.  What's your point?
Take your sunglasses off.
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
What happened to your shades?  Someone finally step on 'em?
I thought you guys were busted.
You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off.
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you in here?
You goin' right back to work?
Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down now.  Haven't we, Jack?
I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.
Meaning?
You busted out?
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
I'll send it to you at Glades.
You don't remember me, do you?
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.
I wanna talk to you about a job.
I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
You there?
Hi, Ray.
How's it going?
You're a fighter?
Moselle Miller?
You like to sit down?
I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows.
Got run over by a car.
You fit another Chanel suit in here?
Was it Foley?
You gonna go get him?
You here all by yourself?
Foley's got it.
We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!
Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
You're Walker, right?
Too late for apologies, Walker.
What lizard?
Rafe's girl, Evelyn?
Ever hear of mai-tai's?  Comes in a big...pot.  Like...like...
Who the fuck taught you to fly?
You'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset.
I understand how it could happen.  I know why any guy would love her.  And I can't blame you that it happened.  You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her.
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
It's tight.
You hear my okay?
Maybe just trying to measure up.
What about easier to hit in an air raid?
Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker.  I'm Rafe McCawley's best friend.
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
Well sure, Colonel --
I thought I'd made it clear, I'm not just putting this mission together -- I'm leading it myself.
'Scuse me, 'Mam.  All the ship's doctors is golfing, and I couldn't find nobody to look at this.
How'd you get this?
Win?
Oh, this is Betty.
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable.  What I feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that.  If I don't come back, I don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life.
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
It's all right.  Danny always said I see things with my emotions instead of my eyes.
Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.
Fook ya!
So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.
You see us as capable of such a blow?
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
You should have left here years ago, like I did.
They're waiting. Come on.
I'll call you Later.
All right. What's the scoop?
Welcome to the singles' scene.
Lucky lady. Hi.
Can you believe I want to marry that dork.
Charlie really has a great voice.
Peggy Sue!
Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed.
Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
Where did you get that sweater?
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
Right. I promised my mother.
There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..
A lot's happened since last weekend.
I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...
Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.
Just take a look at it. 
Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.
. Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue...
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.
You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
Yes, sir.
We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.
Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
Terry, slow down.
If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
Don't get your hopes up.
Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more JellO for me, Mom.'
I thought I knew everything about him.
I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.
Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor.
Damn that Charlie I
I wanted to apologize for this morning.
Oh no!
Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little lightheaded.
I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -how could you do that?
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
I'm excused.
Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
Maddy's party.
No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes JellO.
Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest.
I remember that dress.
I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.
I have to talk to you. It's very important.
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
And then, there's Richard's Burrito.
What're you doing?
Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.
No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you...
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis.
Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
You want some advice, friend? You get in your car, you pick up your family... and you get the hell out of that town.
What happened to you?
How long ago did this guy retire?
What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?
You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you...
Hey! How was your first day at school?
I think so.
Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie didn't die.
All set?
So where're we going?
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
You want me to help?
I've never had anyone die before...  ...but I guess you get over it. I mean, eventually...
How can he not have a heartbeat?
Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus?
You ever think about running away?
Perhaps... you're right. I've certainly been busy. With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time...
Don't apologize for me.
Drew!
You got that right, Mikey...  You still believe that, don't you?
We're not skipping this treatment.
What's wrong with you?
ALLRIGHT IT'S CLOSED!  Jesus!
What's that mean?!
Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry...
... meanwhile, I'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside.
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
Congratulations.
Thanks for your time.
Find a lawyer?
One more thing, Your Honor...
You survived your first gay party intact.
Then we establish how Wheeler's boys recruited you after law school...
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
I've considered that.
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
I better get home. Lisa and I are having some friends over.
You said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had "an adventurous spirit." Is that correct?
In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
No. I can't really see it.
Mom?
Objection!
We're going to draw blood.
The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?
A homosexual encounter.
Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think... ? You think <u>I'm</u>...  ... gay?
Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
Right.
Whoa, whoa...  What do you expect them to say, you're Alan Dershowitz?
Going on... like...?
Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it.
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last.
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
Why, what'd you hear?
Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there.
How many you see?
<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
Step aboard, Carolyn.
Here. Make it easy on you.
Just give me your hand.
Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.
I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at night.
Let's move.  Just a detour. He'll get us there.
Sorry. Thought I heard something.
So why isn't it all bloody?
You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what?
Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
My first run-in with Riddick. Went for the sweet-spot and missed. They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord.  So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business.
Oh, lady. If you're in your right mind, I pray you go insane.
I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.
It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure, not enough oxygen. Might take a few days to --
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.
I don't suppose....
Frightening thought.
Oh, no. No, no, no....
Where's Mr. Johns?
New Mecca....
"God is Great," yes?
We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now....
A toast to whatever he just said.
So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.
Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.
Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't.
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv.
What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
Amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries.
Not a star-jumper.
How did you know we'd come here?
I apologize.
A doll alone proves nothing. True. But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit.
As you wish.
Flight is a scientific impossibility.
Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
We'd better get started. If the mounted police pick up our trail, they'll come this far at least.
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
Taylor -- quit riding him.
This place is dirty, doctor.
But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?
He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.
That's true, Dr. Zaius. My witnesses -- correction -- my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater.
Objection!
Good morning, Dr. Zira.
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
Who are you?
She comes along too.
Shouldn't we be moving on?
Not everything. They left a hostage.  How do you feel, Lucius?
They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
This is a joke in very poor taste.
What about me?
However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.
Certainly not.	You're a mutant.
We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?
Speak! Go on.	Speak again.
You want her that much?
Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING!
Where the fuck is red platoon! Tell 'em to get their asses up here! What the fuck you doin' back here Elias? Round up your assholes and move 'em up front, we're getting chopped to shit.
Bob, I gotta bad feeling about this, I... I'm telling you I got a bad feeling, man, I don't think I'm gonna make it... y'know what I mean?
Hey Big Harold, gimme your peaches for the fruitcake man.
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Y'ever look at yoself in the mirror Junior, youse uglier than a dick on a dog man. 
Shit, I bet I been laid more'n you have.
Come on you can do better than that!
First time?
And you, do you believe?
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
Tell Six we need engineers here, this pos. is crawling with traps.
What are you talking about! 
Whew! - where that come from?
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
You could tell me your name. And where you're going.
Don't I even get my face slapped?
Good evening, Miss.
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
And do you amuse the guests?
Would it make you anymore amusing?
Neatly said...but to the wrong man. The trouble with pretty girls is that they can't imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls. I get tired of it.
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
No. And I've never fired a gun in my life, Aren't you supposed not to touch it?
Nice of him.
Bad?
Why not?
Us?
Anything I can do about it?
It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?
I hated to go to that place.  I almost went to the police station instead.
I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail.
Killaine's wise.  We can't wait any longer.  Here, put this on.  But stay out of sight until we clear the harbor.  I'll tell you when. 
Funny, I never thought of you that way.  You were so close too.  We were all pretty stupid about you.
In a way.
It buys things, just like any other kind.
No.  I paid him off.
Don't go soft on me, baby.  I've got your note in my pocket.  You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it.  It has to be found in exactly the right place.
You'll never make it.  You've out- smarted yourself.
Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
That's an evasion and you know it.
I'm sorry.
Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.
Down below's Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees, there's a beach. You can see it.  Steveston's over there. Coast Guard station.  There's the Yacht Club, and beyond it, the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet, there's Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 feet high. There's a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant.  I'm sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances, Miss Mayfield.
I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why can't you give me your confidence?
That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
I'd like a few words with you, in private.
I'm still asking. What do you want?
What are your rates?
Bluff. You've waited too long.
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly.  How long do we have to wait for this police character?
In case you want to have us followed.
I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--
You'd be breaking the law.
Information.
How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
No more for me, thanks.  Remember what I said.  I can't interfere with the law.
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
I had a father who knew how to steal.
Do me a favor, Mitchell. Find yourself a nice secluded park bench.
I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business.  Greer won't give out.
Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.
What's the face for, Driscoll?
I need a receipt.  Sign your name across the flap.
This make of gun throws a shell backwards, high, and to the right. The chaise is only about four feet from the wall.
Was that about the right angle?
You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder.  What are you going to do about it?
They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
This is the shell.  What about the gun?
No suicide.
I never saw it before.
At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?
I don't understand.
He checks too.
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
This girl is a murderess, Killaine.
There are people in this world who don't think a police badge is a badge of honor.  I'm not one of them.
How long have you had it?
I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you.
She is beautiful. And young.  No thank you.
He's a little unhappy.  I hope he wasn't a nuisance?
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.
To Ann.
History books are first onto the bonfires.
You're kind to be so encouraging.
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
But I'm not an interviewer or a correspondent.
Working hard on that book I was telling you about.  Coming to the meeting?
Are you going to have coffee?
It's everything we wanted.  A very good read.  A terrific piece of work.  So, here's to you and Suez.
Again?
I think we're ready now, thank you.  And how was Norfolk?  Did you get on with my mother?
Might?
We don't seem to get much time to talk.
Blas and epicene.
It's obvious what you have to do. Your way into the daughter's pants is through the mother, up the Suez canal...
That's enough of that.
The torture of small children--
Wait...and with talks at the United Nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties in Westminster.  Speaking on the Jimmy Young Show earlier today, Mrs Thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging.  What is it?
Now, are you going to have some more tea?
I just might give you a ring when we get back to London.  There's one or two things I'd like to... Will you let me have your number before you leave?  Have you ever watched a commercial being made?
It was last year.
It was incredible.  He came back, made a pompous little bow and said, 'My dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish.' And he's promised not to talk to the Press.
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'
Something happened.  You got nuked in the last quarter.
Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
Friends of yours, huh?
What's their program?
Thanks for stepping in.
So what's the biggest?  Waimea?
Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar.
Utah, you copy bruddah?
One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
Why should I?
Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it?
Three seconds... two... one...
Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
Surf conditions okay?
What?
Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
Angelo, pay attention.  There's gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is showing traces of toxins.  PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
They're on their way to Maui.
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
I know where they're going.
Meaning you were expendable.
Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva".
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
Those are cold.
Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?
You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?
You're wastin' your time.
He'll be looking for the trip wires. If we're lucky, he won't see this.
I'll see you there.
Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there...  ... Those fucking eyes...
What's got Billy so spooked?
That's over the border, General.
We can reach an understanding on this.
Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
It's... it's not like that.
The real estate possibilities are endless.  Most of the yard we'll just level.  I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said --
Congratulations, sir.
What would it take to buy our stock back?  Name your price.
Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock.  On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.
No.  What I have is a lot of money.
Mr. Harris.
I... I don't know.  There... there wasn't time...
What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?
Very good.  You're obviously mechanical.
Get in.  This side.
Better believe it.
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
Room service.  What do you drink?
And why do you say that?
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
Good morning.
Do you ever... enjoy it?
No?  Why's that?
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
You still mad at'm?
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
What was I supposed to do?  I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent.
Do I look okay?
But don't they have it in English?
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
What else?  You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?
Right.
You're packing.
Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.
Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.
At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
I want to.
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and <u>we got him</u>.  You there?
Oh, my god... Edward, no!
Looks slow tonight.
Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling.
Who did you think?
Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
It was great.
So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco?
Couple a hours.
What is it, Miss Vivian?
Barnard Thomas here.  Miss Vivian, I wonder if you might come down to the front desk.  There's someone here to see you.
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
May I help you?
What is with you?
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
Get out!
My Westley will always come for me.
You don't seem excited, my little muffin.
Brides often are, I'm told.
I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.
We'll never survive.
We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
Why should that make such a difference?
No more rhymes now, I mean it.
You be careful.  -- people in masks cannot be trusted.
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
Has it been fifteen minutes?
Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
Yes.
Who gets Humperdinck?
Now I think you ought to go to sleep.
There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. They were both masters.
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
No.
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
No --
Sir. Sir.
Sixty-five.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
Do you always begin conversations this way?
Because I know something you don't know.
Who are you?!
Go in, get after her!
He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.
Let me explain-
You're that smart?
Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
Guess what.
Your grandfather's here.
"By the light, by the light,
"He wants to croon, he wants to croon,
Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.
But sir, I'm not condem ...
I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention.  Am I correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people?
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
According to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
What was I saying?
Assume away!
See?  You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.
What scheme?
Mr. Bialystock.  No.  Wait.  Please. You're holding me too tight.  I'm an honest man.  You don't understand.
Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.
You're going to jump on me.
What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?
What kind now, Leo?
Everybody's a big shot.  Well, Leo, are you having a good time?
You bet your boots, Leo.  It's Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise. Upward and onward.  Say, you'll join me.  Nothing can stop us.
I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.
It won't run a week!
They are?  Have you ever eaten with one?  Liebkind, go!  Kill!
Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
Wait.  No.  How do I know I can trust you?  How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived?
Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?
Franz, trust me.  I promise I won't let you down.
Not.
Vhy do you always call me kraut? Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not franks!
Do you need us?
Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum. Got dag pa dig.  Bialystock and Blum.
We make love?
Good.  Yes.  Thursday.
By the sacred memory...
Of Siegfried...
Heil you know who!
People can hear you.
You out to buy a motel?
No.
Not at all!
I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing.
That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  But...  She didn't fool my mother.
You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?
There's an old saying, "First customer of the day is always the most trouble!" But like I said, I'm in no mood for it so I'm just going to treat you so fair and square you won't have one human reason to give me...
Sick of the sight of it!  Well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? I was just about...
Yes, Mr. Lowery.
You should've called in the police the second you found your sister has skipped. You go starting private investigations, using people you don't even know...
No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
He didn't come back here?
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.
And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.
It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.
Why do you ask that?
An Institution? A madhouse?  People always call a madhouse "someplace."  Put her in Someplace!
Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast.  What time will you...
That's it. 
In the course of my duty, I never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest...
Wait a minute!
I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?
I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper...  ...by candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
He was out when I was there. If he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet.
Was that all?
By gosh, them stiffs are get- tin' heavier and more of 'em every day. They even got the coroner working overtime.
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
Then you knew of the inheritance?
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
That's what I said. Now, lis- ten to me. I want you to help me take this woman down stairs. I will give her a shot. You can take care of her till I get help.
No, no! I won't sign any pa- pers. You can't make me--
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh 
Thousands?
You can't double-cross me like that.  You were to help me. You were to operate on him. You were going to put him under my power.
[Something very important. I have been threatened;] Mrs. Maxwell, my assistant's wife, is crazy.  She thinks I mur- dered her husband. [She wants to murder me.] I want you to help me quiet her-- give her a shot from this hypo. [Keep it hid till we get her] down in the basement-- there is a secret vault [there]. We will put her there till we get your husband--[then turn her over to the authorities. Then we will both be free.]
The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.
The blood transfusion continues. Marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the dark. Nikolas watches Lone's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again.
Yes, why?
She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
We'll be coming to the opening.
But it was really my fault.
Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask.
Hey, what do you think you're doing? Put that stuff back!
Charming. More delightful people crippled.
And how does one go about getting these human documents, may I inquire?
Well, ain't that a shame. Nice little chappie that wouldn't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow.
I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He's kept out o' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the Indians.
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.
No kiddin'?
Listen, stupid, could I do anything that would possibly meet with your approval?
I don't remember. Not so very far--
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
Do you know George Winton?
Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.
What do you mean police dog?
I told you he was a sore.
That's what I said.
Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do?
Why?
--and so determined to live that I'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.
It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
How much money have you got?
If my curiosity is not too great, would you mind telling me what manner of animal this is you are designing?
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
Shall we unpack it?
I'd be glad to, Mr. Igor.  I think I'll have somethin' to tell you soon.
I'd know him anywhere.
Well, any time I can do anything for you --
Could we go somewhere?
Could you?
What did it want?
Yes?
I am in awe of it, Mother.
Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill.
Actually, I am, though.
Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?
You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.  Buddy, please don't tell on me.
Did your Momma really give you castor oil?
You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.
Hi, Buddy.  How's my sweetheart who never told on me when I was bad?
He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.
He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook!
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
Children, children! Be quiet, all of you!  The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?
What'd you say, Brother?
Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.
It's pitiful. Neither one of them know.
I think she's gonna kiss him.
Why is it taking so long?
Is her husband sick or something?
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?
That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
Well, if it isn't malignant and she can get through the operation all right, it might be better than her really being pregnant. She doesn't even know who the father might have been.
How goes it, darlin'?
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house.
Lay off of that stuff, son. It upsets your mother.
I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
Well, she's back.
I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.
It has been three weeks since I "fired" her. Is there no way to get rid of this girl? Are we stuck with her for life?
Her plan is obvious, plain as day. She's going on a hunger strike. The question is, how do we foil her?
You're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is, what are we going to do?
Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her!
How is she?
All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk... about this thing, let's discuss it.
Rose, Rose, Rose, you poor miserable little child, don't you know I love you? Do I have to put my hand on your body or kiss your pretty lips to prove it? You are beautiful to me, Rose, I've loved you since you first came here, darlin'. And don't you know Mrs. Hillyer loves you, too, that she's already taken you into her heart, and that that woman's heart is as wide as the blue sky itself and as deep as the stars?
How can the buttons stand the pressure?
You were up late last night, too, Rose.
Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the hotel. You and Brother can handle the girl's epizootics. I'll just say one more thing.  Rose, I told you you had a friend in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she would fight for you like a tiger?
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
Well, we know you were there. The bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous.
Well, I am in the construction business, Buddy, and without braggin' I have done real good at it.  There are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me.  Right now I'm buildin' a giant motel unit near Alexandria, outside Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm on the construction side.
Galley what?
How about that. Well, you always were a screwball.
I don't mean that the way it sounds.  Imagine it, a book. And I used to know you personal way back when.  Tell me something, Buddy, how do you dream up all that stuff?
Took your time gettin' here.
I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?
You might see her. She writes your Daddy, and she and that doctor came to see him, didn't they? I wish you'd tell her something... I never could write letters.
A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.
Don't worry, Madam, she can't infect your dear little kiddies. She long ago fully recovered, but the disease did irreparable damage. The girl is permanently barren.
I don't want to go to the dentist.
Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?
I'm not goin' in there, I don't like the looks of it!
No more dentists, no more dentists...
Rose, you're very sick. You're burning up. Rose, can you hear me? Rose?
Hasn't he got enough problems, or didn't you notice that's not cream soda on his breath?
How much?
Have I ever steered you wrong?
Come on, don't you screw with her, please!  You... you got to want this: armored car job.  CalTrust Bank. They took two million in cash...
You're Zimmermann's calculator, Archie.  All the blood money you had to move around to make this deal, you got to know something.  Maybe they told you, maybe you overheard things you weren't supposed to hear...
It's six o'clock.  Time's runaing out.  Decide.
Last time Billy-Boy did this, the guy's neck broke...  ... just like that.  Sad in a way. Why is it we don't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
Make a hole, Billy-Boy.
"A.D."
That's them trying to kill us.
What's the plan?
Who's been giving you history lessons?  Your bartender?
They... they shot me.
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.
You never heard of physics, Einstein? The laws of physics.  The more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires...
It doesn't say that.
Okay.  But, what changed our mind?
Bad news is, word's spreading like wildfire that we don't have badges, and nobody wants to end up getting splattered like Butch Cassidy either.
No.  Don't open your mouth!  You <U>honestly</U> think you can explain this to my satisfaction?
Your poison's not gonna make it into the veins of any kids this time.
Pardon me... my mistake.  Taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?
Pure horse.
You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
I just think you should show some respect.  I mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom...
Yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  They couldn't go doing everything at once.
If they crash, maybe he'll run.  You can shoot him in the leg or something.
You need a doctor.
Any preferences?
How'd we do?
Why the beach?
Do tell.
This shit was Ming.
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
Yes, my Master.
The same as always.
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
I don't know.  Fly casual.
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
I'm sorry.
Yes.
Han! Chewie?
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
Proper?!
What did he say?
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
Over there! Two more of them!
If that is your destiny.
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
Yes or no will do.
How many languages do you speak?
Do you have any tattoos Brad.
You!
The future is ours so let's plan it.
Uh huh.
Oh Janet
Oh Brad, I'm mad.
I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry.
What a guy
Was all I had to say
Want to come again and stay
Wheeling
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
The Master is not yet married.  Nor do I think he ever will be.  We are simply his servants.
I thought you liked them.  They liked you.
Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
I had it pulled. People callin' all the time.  Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?
It's only temporary.
Would ya take off your glasses?
Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me?
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
...Can't do it.
Nothin'! I want nothin' from you!!!
How 'bout this Billy Snow?
Joe Zack is a good prospect -- Exciting boy.
We'll kill you, man -- We gotta gun.
Ten minutes for ten dollars.
Here -- Three minutes.
...How 'bout for the Cokes?
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
I say ya nothin'!
You can forget about sparring, kid.
Yo' yellow, old man.
Ya still light seventy.
He only had a hundred an' thirty. -- I think he's good for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo.
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
Rocky, would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed for the Championship?
...Screw you.
What?
Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work...  Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?
Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato.
The legs must be goin'.
A Rep from Miles Jergens' Promotions was lookin' for ya -- They need sparrin' partners for Creed.
Please, kid.
Tie it to both ankles -- Leave two feet slack.
What cha say, Benny -- Meet 'The Rock.' This is our cutman, Benny Stein.
Don't let 'im get you tight.
I don't care what they say, you're a winner.
...What kinda dog is this again?
Yo, Paulie.
Hey --
Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.
Why?
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
To see ya train.
Is it true the most you've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars?
And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.
So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
What's with the dip?
Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
Maroon?  Whaddaya want?
My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
What the hell are you doin'?
So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
I'll get it.
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
What the hell are you doin' in there?
No, kid, you're a real hero.
By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.
Why that pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
More than prince of cats. He is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick- song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause: the immortal passado! punto reverso! the hai!
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
What dares the slave Come hither, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
It strains me past the compass of my wits.
Hold Daughter!
What, daughter are you busy? Need you my help?
Goodnight.
Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
Young hearts run free. Never be caught up, caught up like Rosaline and thee. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
That dreamers often lie.
Ho Ho, Capital Punks!
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Ay, a scratch, a scratch. HA HA HA.
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.
Calm, Dishonorable, Vile Submission! Thou art my souls hate! Tybalt! You ratcatcher, will you walk?
Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.
O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.
It's under your seat.
And you believed me?  But it wasn't my people who did it.
What is?
Not to me, you know that.
Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to me, and if you are you're a dead man!
What in bloody hell is going on?
Good Christ!  Can't you lose these jokers?
Do I need to repeat myself?
Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.
I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -  Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed.  Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of it."  "Have the girl fuck him."  But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less.
Now, what did we steal?
I'm a patriate.
Who are you?  IRA?
Where's the case?
That fucking figures...
What do you mean?
If you say a word in English, Vincent, my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. Sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want might get me killed if I give it to you, and that's a price I'm not willing to pay.
Sit, sit...  Would you like one?
And more importantly --
So, you've got it all figured, do you?
Then where is it?
Gregor, is that you?
I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
Are you sure you won't have a drink?
Yeah.
It gets done now or not at all.  Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.
He sees this differently, as you well know.
It's been known to happen.
They call me Swede.
Where is this broad?
He says this is their block.
That was a nice move you did on our young friend.  Judo?
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.
You were once some kind of special forces.  Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy SEAL.  After that you rode shotgun for the CIA in some place like El Salvador or Afghanistan, a real mercenary.  Only now -- now you're like the rest of us, it's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war.  There's a lot of hired guns out here, and not nearly enough work to go around.
You know, what you pulled back there, that was bullshit.
I came up here to sneak a smoke.
You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you.
It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group.
Alright, it's done.
You know him?
You would have done that?
Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
And now...
You son-of-a-bitch...
What happened to it?
You slept with her!
You slept with her!
My man, how you doing?
I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.
Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher.  He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars!  Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that?  His excuse was the government got it all.
Call it in I guess.  Why?
We don't know that.
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
It's no accident we stumbled on this money.  It's an answer to a prayer!  Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  Tonight my prayer came true.
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
I don't know...
We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.
I can't do that.
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
And how do you figure we do that?
Not bad enough to kill him.
How long is it going to take?!
Here it is.
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!
I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
We've got to go now, then.
It's too late...
And you're solid on that?
There's going to have to be a change in our arrangement.
I was beginning to think you weren't going to show.  That can't be all of it.
Thank you.  Now, do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site, on your way to or from?
I have to go to the bank before it closes.
I don't know, Booth.
Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?
Sally, do you love me?
I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.
Test the product?
Business is business.  Now where the hell is it?  I wanna get out of here.  That's the plan, we're just flunkies, you know what I'm saying?
I have a better plan.  You want to hear it?
Well we'd like to help you in any way we can.  We're all in this together, as law enforcement officers.
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Anything I can help you with?
Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
Jesse?
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
What's this?
What are you saying?
Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.
I'm not asking.
What the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches --
Did they ever find out who they were?
Don't you want it?
You think he skipped town?
James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.
Yeah, that's right.
Look, I've been working this case for months now...
How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
Would you like me to tell you how your father died?
You bring American money?
You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.
No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
Hello.
Well, hurry up.
I have plenty of dates.
You.
What, leave you alone so he can cap you?
I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...
Who?
The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
No.  It was my singing.
Slow down, baby.
Is it hot in here?
They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.
Look, man I'm sorry.  I know you got a thing for her.
I'm not used to having a partner.
See you in the next world.
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
Hello, Benjamin.
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
Vegas...
Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She almost got us killed.  She's setting you up again!
I saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? You played it cool, though.  Walking away, never looking back.
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
First class.
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year.  Then Tan got hold of one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills.
Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
You're just like your father, Lee.  All these years hiding behind his badge.  I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change.  When you think about it, I didn't really kill him.  I just put him out of his misery.
I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a man who used to train with you.  He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal.
Shut up!
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
You talk very fast.
I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information.
Where were we?
Right....
I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened.
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
Now, that's American music.
You know War?
Want some?
Like that.
No, please, I don't --
Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is?
You don't like it?
You OK?
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment.  Make him think you don't trust him.
You know something? Every time I see this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a double latte grande...  With two shots of non-fat milk.
You sonuvabitch.
Yes.
You look awful.
Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad.
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
And in a "V".
I'll get the dress.
Bob's in a hurry.
"Sink the putt."
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
Fisher, let him talk.
No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?
Yeah.
No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...
You could have told me you were fiance number three.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?
It's okay.  There's no microphone. You're no fun.
I am just such a reporter.  And you are?
Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?
Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out there.  You don't think they'll call it off...?
Look, look, man.  I think the man is heartbroken.
My magazine doesn't pay because for stories.  It's not what you call ethical.
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
Five hundred.
It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.
It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.
I don't know.
Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?
Watch your leg, Dad.  I'm so tired of this.
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
Where did you disappear to?
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
That's called changing your mind.
I'm sorry, Bob.  She kissed me back.
To who?  Are you asking me?
And the church.
I'm okay with that.
So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?
Reporter?
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.
"What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore.
You tell Maggie.
Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.
The short one with black hair is your cousin Irene --
Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
Don't touch them.  I feel terrible sneezing at a time like this.  This is a big moment for me --
I was thinking, I have to go up to Boston for the AAP convention and then visit Winston-Hughes about switching over our computers.  Why don't we meet in New York for Valentine's Day weekend?
Miss Scarlett.  In the broom closet.  With the radio.
Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.
Right.
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
He lost all the weight... there.
Plus he fell in love with a temp.
Men never get this movie.
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
Did you talk to him?
You told a lie and got on a plane.
Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
What?
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
You were standing in the middle of the street?
What about the letter?
You're going to miss the train.
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
Maybe you should see a shrink.
Go home for the weekend.
Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
Oh God, it's major.  He's kissing her on the lips.  I have to stop this.
Sure you do.
Which means --
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
Hello.
I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm not mad at you.
What was it that made you know?
It is not --
Hey, my plate is full.
Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.
You'll see.
Write her.
This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
Dad --
Does red pepper go under R or P?
Sure.  Looking good.
She looks like my third grade teacher.  I hated my third grade teacher.  Hold it! Wait a minute! She <u>is</u> my third grade teacher!
If you get a new wife, I guess you'll have sex with her, huh?
Will she scratch up your back?
In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff.  When they're having sex.
This is a good letter, Dad.
It's a sign.
I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --
Did you call that radio station again?
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --
When I found you?
Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- you must be Jonah.
Do you like baseball?
Yes?
You look good.
No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
I read an article about this ...
It takes time --
I mean it. I know your work record. You were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that? You had a real future with this company, but you let those Reds stir you up. And now they'll sell you down the river. Why don't you wake up, Ray?  That's your name, isn't it, Ray?
Are you going to let us pass -- or do I have to call the Sheriff?
Got any more ideas?
Jenkins ain't no boss.  Mean we're gonna let people like Jenkins stay here?
It's like Charley Vidal says -- there's two kinds of slavery, wage slavery and domestic slavery. The Woman Question, he calls it.
Foreman wants to get the ore out. Miner wants to get his brothers out. In one piece.
Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession?
Why are they singing, Mama?
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
This water's cold again.
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
What's the matter?
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
How do you feel?
Did you have to sign a pledge? Not to go back to the line?
I waited up till midnight.
That meeting only lasted ten minutes.  The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
Charley's my friend. I need friends.  Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
No, you don't. Have you learned nothing from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you still think you can have dignity only if I have none?
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
Don't horse me. Price of zinc's never been higher. They don't want no strike -- not with their war boom on.
Hear those deputies slugged 'Cente.
Go on. Spill it.
No ...
What are you doing here?  Something wrong with Mama?
Boy! Did you see the way Mama whopped that deputy with her shoe? Knocked the gun right out ...
Papa, can't I leave now? There's a meeting of the Junior Shop Stewards ...
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
My kids don't have enough to eat!
You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy.
All I saw was the headlights. The high beams were on.
What is it?
Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.
Jesus, I look like a raccoon.
What about the guy on the very bottom?
You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
Who is it?
I'm kind of busy.
He knows where I work.
It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money.
You're good, princess. I'll give you that.
Maybe I am dealing with it.
How the hell did we get this detail?
Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.
My features. They're Finnish.
You remember that guy you told me about ... said he could handle a big hook-up?
Okay
But...I've seen you.
Not bad.
Can we talk price?
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
You want to do this some other time?
Don't address me.  I didn't make the accusation.
What the hell is this?
What?
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
You don't find that repugnant?
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
That's because he doesn't have one.
Took a pig-slicker to the heart.
This the guy?
Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. I've done everything you guys have asked of me.
Jimmy?
What's that smell?
You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit.
First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  Which is it?
And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat.
We're in business.
Where's Bubba?
I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family.
Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee.
You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?
Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...
Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue.
Watching.
Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
It looks like a Renoir.
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
You think they'll be alright?
How about...?
HOLD YOUR FIRE!
John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
What do you think?
There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen.
I don't think so, Captain.
Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
Reiben, what's the matter with you? I don't gripe to you.  I'm a captain. There's a chain of command.  Griping goes one way, up, only up, never down.  You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers.  Up, get it? I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe in front of you.  How long you been in the army?
Any further thoughts on the subject?
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
Scans the Germans with his binoculars.
Maybe Caen.
Continues FIRING.  CUTTING DOWN the advancing Germans.
Private.  I'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help.
Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.
Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.
You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.
Frogs?
So, where are you from?
Demolition, right?
Pardon me?
What's the profile?
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
How can you, how can you say that?
No, no he's not.
Jesus.  What, I live in a palace, right?  I have guests here.
Speak with my lawyer.
Keep it.
But you never had a first date.
What does it say?
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
Lloyd, it's us.
I wrote sixty-three songs this year.  They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.
Why?
I can't give you that.  This guy's been ripping off grandma and grandpa for seventeen years.  He's been getting it from every end.  I'd love to hear his story.
And I want to turn the home over to the state.
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years... I might cut that part out.
They really applauded you today honey.
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
Which they did.  Let me finish.
You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
Do you love him?
Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.
Dad, are you okay in there?
Sweetheart, no.  Don't be ridiculous.
You think you know what this money is?
Mom, please?
No noise, no sound, no movement, nothing!  Hello, Diane?
Whoah, what a day, huh?
Yeah.
Actually, I think that I...
Well...
What are these?
Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
He does this every year?
Sure I do.
Oh.
Me?  Sure I do.
Stop by later.
Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
I don't think so.
Why didn't you tell me?
Okay, what did we just decide?
Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?
She figured it out.  I'm sorry if that upsets you.
You do?
One more time would be nice.
I'm fine.
Okay.
Yeah.
Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works.
No, really.
Hi, Lloyd.  This is my eighth and final call...
I know
"You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel..."
Joe.  Joe.  She's written sixty-five songs.  They're all about you.  They're all about pain.
Certainly.
I love you man.
Later for you, Luke.
Oskar - my friend Lena.
Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
It's not a charade, all this?
Do you have any idea what's involved? The paperwork alone?  Forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy.  Then the engineers show up.  They stand around and they argue about drainage - I'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, I've been through it, I know.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
What are you doing?
Oskar, good of you to come.
He doesn't deserve your loyalty.  More important, he's not worth you making threats against us.
Jews, yeah.  Investors.
I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  We're doing well?
Better this month than last?
It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar, I know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys.  It's got a ritual significance to them, Jews shoveling snow.
What's he done that's so bad - take money? That's a crime?  Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war?  We're here to make money, all of us.
You're sure about this two person thing?
I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help.
How do you put up with this Greek shit?
I think he's doing Dolly.
Where's Sid?
No way.
This is exactly what I don't want.
My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
Where's Sid?
You have every right to be upset.
Not good. How you doin?
Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
This is all too familiar.
Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.
You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.
Who is this?
No, wait...
Sidney. Hello. How are you?
I'm sorry.
Yes, goddammit!
I dont know.
Time to change numbers again?
We're missing the Sig Ep party.
Can I come with her?
I'm the only one who can cut him down.
The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife. The young girl is helpless...
Sid, I'll seeya tonight.
Hello?
What do you care? Let 'em have their fun. So, what's up?
SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? Wait, let me guess. THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY? Am I close?
I'll be right back.
I think Jeff Bridges is getting tired.
I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.
What?! But I did everything you said to do!
Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.
That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.
OK, look.  We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.
The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.
What do you mean?
What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
What?
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
They found another note?
You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
What about me?
You used to say that was our strength.
The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
Stop following me.
Good morning Gale. Pleasure to be here.
AND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH! This is complete bullshit. Who wrote this piece of crap?
God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
Who's this?
Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
You're dead!
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
Owwww...
You ready to party hard tonight?
Nope.
That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy.
Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight?
And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
I wanna let go. I do...
Jesus... fuck, that hurt.
You bitch -- where the fuck are you?
What number are you trying to reach?
I don't know.
Listen, asshole...
Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else.
How do you know his name?
...please... no...
Don't make me... I can't... I won't.
I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.
Evening, ma'am.
Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check out a possible lead. Thought you might like to join me.
I like it. It's... sexy.
I'll call for backup.
You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?
Have they found my father?
We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.
I was first to respond.
Drive by patrol.
Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.
They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.
Jesus...
Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddamnit.
Where is she?
What's the plan?
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
Where do you get this shit?
I have no idea.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
Why would you call me from my front porch?
Have a good trip.
That was an ice pick -- not exactly the same.
And are the police aware you dated the victim?
She's saving herself for you.
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
Do you really think Billy did it?
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
That's mature.
With that set of lungs -- she should be.
I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that.  And nobody's going to swap with you.
You don't.  It goes to court now.
What's this: "I'm declining this case?"  It don't work that way.
You've left unfinished business before.
Well, there he sits.  It's not supposed to make sense.
Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!
Where we headed?
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.
Just keep leading the way.
There's a bucket here.
I'm declining this case.  I want us reassigned.
It's too soon for him.
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition.
No witnesses of any kind?
Nothing.
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!
I wish I still thought like you.
The fingerprints.
Why would we?
How was it?
The way this has gone till now, I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy.
I'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
How much money do you have?
By telling you this, I'm trusting you more than I trust most people.
Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
This is a waste of time.
You're sure you're reading that right? John Doe?
This is stupid.  It'd be just too easy.
Are you alright?
What are you talking about?
Well, there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room, and near as I can tell, each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages.
No dates indicated, placed on the shelves in no discernible order.  It's just his mind poured out on paper.  I don't think it's going to give us any specifics.
No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
He cut her up and dressed the wounds.
As soon as this is over, I'm gone.
Stay with him.
It's nice to meet you.  My husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.
It smells good.
I hear you and Mills were high school sweethearts.
You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting.  I'm sorry.  It's really none of my business.  It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that.  If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag.  That's how he is.
I don't know, with this case.
It was Ethan found you squallin' in a sage clump after your folks was massacred...
Passed the Todd place comin' in... What happened to 'em?
Let's get along...
You've said that enough!...Maybe Lucy's dead...maybe they're both dead...but if I hear it from you again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards!
Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?
<U>Charlie</U> <U>MacCorry</U>!...You weren't fixin' to marry HIM??
Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?
You all right, sergeant?
Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay...Charlie, hightail it to head- quarters an' spread the word...
Got a warrant?
They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day- break.
Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
If there's anything I can do, sir...
And what makes you think he's in this territory?
No Debbie! That ain't what happened! They been lyin' to you...
Steady, Daniel Boone! You don't want to miss...It makes them think their medicine's stronger than yours...
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
Scar! Where's he holed in?
Keep talking.
And maybe you lie...
I beg your pardon?
Are you sure they didn't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o' Yank bluebellies so scared they couldn't tell the difference between a Cheyenne and a Comanche?
What you want me to call you?
Say!...What happened to your blanket? Lose it?
And you think we got a chance to find her?
Good night...Laurie...
Hey! What's the idea...?
Sorta like 'roundabout' -- like a man says he's goin' one place when he means to go just the reverse...
You ask her!
I think maybe we oughta...
What's that got to do with us?
Was your niece about their age?
I'd be obliged if you'd get to the point, ma'am.
Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...
They never find that girl.
It wasn't much of a letter...
But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...
Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...
She'd be about thirteen now...
Hey... the fuse.
Where are you going?
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.
I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
Of course you'll give me the blame again.  Like back then.  Just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - isn't that right, Ellen?
That's alright.  Don't misunderstand my husband.  It's only that he's already had enough problems with this case. And who would believe him if he told the truth?
It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...
Stop scaring people.  Let's go. We need to be on our way.
I know your face. Are you an actor?
What do you want, Kit?
Never!
I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for Romeo!
I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.
I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.
When?
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
There's never any
Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's DaughterAlmost finished?
Do you know it?
Who is she this time?!
Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful -
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?
Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.
How will it?
Kit
What is the story?
His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is Mercutio.
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?"
Well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.
He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona.
I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond.
"All my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay, And follow thee my lord throughout the world."
"Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg'd."
Like you, I found him not at home!
Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.
You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!
Then I will go with you.
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.
I meanYour Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
Take off your hat.
And her lips?
What of her bosom?
But what of Lord Wessex?
Oh!--it's--it's--oh, it's a house of ill- repute!
Is there a man?
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win.
Only on expenses.
No.
No.
You think so?
When are you going to let the police know?
That was good.
Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do --
What's the problem?
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around?
How much did you pay?
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
But they know.
Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
Don't know what?
Is this being recorded?
No. Why should it?
I've never seen any of these men before.
I don't know them.
Parked outside?
That's it, then.
Just one thing.
And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are the sunshine of my life'?
Who was it?
Know and love?
I think you're lying.
Have you seen Hugo?
Now?
Alex.
Who's going to do it?
I don't thinkI can.
Whoever draws the short straw does it all. That way, you either do it or you don't. All or nothing.
Stop nagging.
David, I promise we will. Keep him happy.
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
No.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
It's about me and David.
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
Of course.
How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
Loks like you had a break-in up here as well.
Yes.
It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.
I've never seen a dead body before.
Two hundred pounds.
But I bet you didn't say you were going to split on him.
You get the job done.
It's nice.
I see.
No.
Shall I answer it?
And he's a patient of yours?
Air Portugal, on the other hand, via Lisbon, same day, five hundred and sixty-five. Five six five. It's up to you. Catering important?
Yes.
Both, sir.
Don't you like her?
Do you think George is a fairy?
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
We cannot go into this later.
Why not?
I don't know.
I know.
I'll be back in a while.
Nummers.
All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.
She what?
See if you've been making it with my mother.
I asked you first.
Well, are you?
You are.
Jesus, look at this. Nine, nine and three quarters -- that's our prime rate. And I'll tell you something else: the big boys are going for it.
Pardon me?
I've got the customers... that's my point. I'm the one they want. If I had my own shop, they'd leave and come to me. I have a lot of customers.
Yes, Buffums.
Jesus...
I don't know. Probably not.
I'm sure.
Okay... but I want you to know one thing.  I've got to look great tonight, I mean I have to look great, okay?
And?
If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you.
You know what I'm talking about.
Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
Baby...
Look, either come in or stay out!
Where do you want to go?
What are you looking at?
-- yeah.
-- but you never were much of a tit man --
Me?
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
I don't know... Jackie?
I can't just let him stand by the door...
I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone.
Yeah?...
Yeah!
That boy always does great. He's a corporal or a squad leader or something, just wrote me from some place called Kwang Due?
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...
Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas.
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream.
George --
When I was a little kid, I used to want to go to Europe but right now wherever I am I'm gonna be in Europe.
You've never even been around one.
George?
What do you want?
When is that?
A friend dropped me off.
Never mind. Where've you been?
Now, Jackie --
Bullshit.
That was him.
Obviously.
What difference does it make?
How?
What? What? What? What? What?
Yes, yes, I did.
You need a cut.
Said what!
But what?
It's good you want to do something, George.
George, could you -- excuse us for a minute?
Felicia's really interested in the shop, isn't she?
-- maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up Jackie here.
I know it, I know it.
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
That's got nothing to do with it... You're so beyond my comprehension I can't even discuss it with you.
Was it me, did you have something against me?
I wanna hear it from you!
What about Jackie?
All right, who're you with? Jill?
Well, commercials. I read for a soap the other day.
Well maybe I can get you something.
The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
I called to tell you I was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?
It must be something.
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
He does?
-- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there...
-- He reached up and tore them.
Well he's not exactly a friend.
Sort of.
What does he do? Is he an actor?
-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
-- why?
You're kidding.
Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?
We'll let you know tomorrow.
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
You wouldn't ever hurt Mummy and me, would you?
Are you sure?
Do you like ice cream, Doc?
Yes.
Jack...
Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?
Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.
Mommy...
Now Danny, can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth?
Is Tony one of your animals?
To my stomach.
Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay?
Shall we go into the living room?
Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?
It's okay, really.
That doesn't matter, sir.  You're the important one.
Delbert Grady.
haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Who?
A nigger!
I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.  I fear that is the only thing to do.
Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
Bill, how do you do?
Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter.
It's good to see you.
No charge?
Hi, babe.
I made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up.
It's really nice up here, isn't it?
or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in.  Now do you think you can handle that?
I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had.  It's the most horrible dream I ever had.
You went into the room Danny said - to 237?
And you didn't see anything at all?
Get him out of here?
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?
I just want to go back to my room.
Don't hurt me!  Don't hurt me!
Jack, stay away from me!
Mr. Ullman?
Very nice to meet you.
Only in a very general way.
The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
Oh...well this is our gold ballroom.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.
What time does the plane leave?
Bill, would you have the Torrances' things brought in their apartment.
Lowe's car-?
The moon's not down yet...
Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
Don't you touch me, snotbrains!
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
I've been hearing noises in there.
You all right, Marty?
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
It could have been anything, Marty.
I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
I come here because Marty needs a friend.
And don't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come!
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
You know, I just might!
LET THY SPIRIT
And I'm tearful!
How come?  Sister?
Come on -- stay.  Just a little.  We can talk, I'll get a pizza.  Pizza in bed, we'll have fun.  And you still haven't told me what happened.  What did she say?
Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's God!
Thanks.  A lot.
I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp!
HE'S SO FINE.
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
Hold on.
SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I'LL BE HIS AND HE'LL BE MINE WE'LL LOVE UNTIL THE END OF TIME AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE
What?
Like this place?
Soprano or alto?
Mary Clarence, are you with us?
Sure.  Kind of... free-lance.
Yeah, for one second.  That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other.  Be a group.
Is there any syrup?
We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.
Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one.  Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?
A cigarette?
We must... get you some experience.  We must... leave this place.
I'm getting experience.
Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences.  I've learned so much.
What?
It's contraband.  Don't ask.  But I wanted to give you a treat.  A sort of... thank-you gift.
Mary Clarence!
I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING
I see.
It has come to pass.
How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"
Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping- Pong?  Row over to the monastery?
Yeah?
Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's important, nowadays.  You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.
I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!
So... hi there.
You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart.  As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
A vote?
But... wait a minute...
So I don't shop.
When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant?  What do you want -- cheap thrills?
And if I don't?
I hate you.  I totally hate you.
Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em.
Like what?
I just need a few more weeks,
So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
Don't you have a concert to go to?
Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent.  So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun?
Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a wonderful world.  Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so.  Dead or alive.
Well?
Get her!
You didn't shoot!
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
Reverend Mother?
But, Bishop...
Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?
Who took the meat?
It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves.
Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm?  How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?
I will not allow it.  I will not!
For poaching.  Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?
It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
Do you have these persons' wills?
May I see them, Master Hardenbrook?
Damn... damn... damn...
Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
Tell me something.  What becomes of Young Masbath?
Out there.  What do you see?
What is it?
Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
All I saw was their lantern.
My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.
I was getting worried.  Who was it?
What books?
She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir? 
Climb up!
What now?
How are you?
My suitor?
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
These scars.  How did you get them?
Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it.  The bird seems to be in his cage.
You promised justice.
Why would you do such a thing?
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
Blood.
I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating to resist.  I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said.
Where are we going?
What was that?
Ichabod...
The blades will carry us to the ground. Face front and wait for me.
You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower?
It appears well.  It has already clotted.
There was not much blood, was there?
What... what are you doing?
They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.
All right then.
Hit ain't got no gas in it.
Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to see you. Been a long time.
Don't look much like he could. You say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness.
Can I help you?
Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin' that big-ass bass.
We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?
Doyle, you're awful. You shouldn't be that way.
Let's go, Vaughan.  Frank, we'll be back in a little while. I'll bring you back somethin'. You're food's in the oven warmin' over.
Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.
You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.
Leave.
Last time you got mad and run Morris and them off and said to stay away from here.
You like that Vaughan?
I bet you like sittin' between two men in a dual wheel truck don't you?
What's all them books?
On the bass, give it up for Terence "One Ball" Atkins.  On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group.  On drums "The Johnson."  And last and most importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a big hand for these guys. They're workin' their asses off here.  Okay I'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight. To my lovely female companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl - what's your last name Karl?
What's you last name?
How come?
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
How do you know?
I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
Hey Karl, you off work?
It's name's A Christmas Carol.
Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
Oh, jackin' off?
And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny.  You know why I want you to play ball with me?
Why not? It died?
So it died when it come out?
That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother.
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
She said she'd see me later. That's kinda good, right?
Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in. Mama said he's stayin' over tonight and he's talkin' about movin' in for good. We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl?
Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for a Mister Turner tomorrow and a closin' up shop early.
Yeah.
Way to go, Karl. We got a touchdown. That was a good lateral, man. That was just like the Wishbone.
I know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me.
It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you?
Yeah, I guess.
Hey, Karl. How'd you know to come out here?
Just diggin'.  I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. I wish me and you and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn't ever born.
Don't go home tonight and stay with that Doyle. He's got it in for ye tonight. I got me a feelin', too. Feels like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and mean. Ye mama neither. When you get up from here, I want you to go to that feller's house. Your mama's friend. I want you to give me your word on it.
What are you doin' up again, Frank? You need to get a little sleep.
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
Well, at least he's tryin'. But who knows for how long.
I'm ye boy.
Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody?
I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.
Karl, you up?
Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?
I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?
Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?
What's wrong? Is everything okay?
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?
Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.
You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. He couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. But, his father made sure that his mother knew what the Bible said. And she made sure Karl knew. You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right?
His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex--
But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.
It's the best you're gonna get. I'm sorry.
Is he leaving right this minute?
Will he be supervised?
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
And what are you, his chaperone?
So your mother grew up in Shanghai?
What happened?
What about for you?
Do me a favor, will you?
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
They're all the same.
So, what brings you to a dive like this?
Hey, Auggie, I've just been thinking. You wouldn't need some help around the store, would you? Some summer help while Vinnie's gone?
You usually get two.
Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?
So. Are we ready?
I'm all ears.
It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her.
What do you mean?
Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you?
All right, sugar, what's on your mind?
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
She looks just like you.
Still, you can't just write her off.
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
No you're not.
Lovely.
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
A job?  I definitely wouldn't turn down a job.
I'll be back in about an hour. Watch the register while I'm gone, okay?
To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.
That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.
Forty-four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.
I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.
I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself.  Do you mind if I sit down?  He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.
His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.
That's funny. His name is the same as yours.
Yeah, but he's my son. Nothing strange about that. He's my own flesh and blood. But here you got the same name as this man here, and you're not even the same color.
Thomas.
Well?
What are you talking about?
I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.
Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit.
Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.
That's where the what comes in.
The material world is an illusion. It doesn't matter if they're there or not. The world is in my head.
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
I didn't expect to see you again.
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry... I was trying to reach for one of the books up there ...  And then, I don't know, the sky fell on top of me.
I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember?  If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.
Two or three nights.
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
Where did you get that thing?
Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.
I don't know.
Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
Hi, kid.
Yeah, give him another one. And I'll take a cup of coffee while you're at it.
Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
I'll take the iced coffee.  You only live once, right?
Lettuce and tomato?
It is.
Now, Mister Gi...
So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?
Boat has two batteries.  Lose one you run off the other til morning. Carl musta lost both, so Miyamoto there gave him one a his.
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
I told myself that was good.  That it made our friendship special.  And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily.
You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael.  Not once, not ever.  There's no half- way.  As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go.
...so when the sheriff returned, you showed him the injury to the deceased's head.
Maybe it went.  Where Carl went. Over the side.
Then putting them together.  So truth is revealed.
I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...
And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful.  At a tactic that insults their intelligence.
Robbed.  He was angry.
I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest.
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
And you keep the records, or contribute to 'em.
He's looking down.  And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday.  He's proud of the man you are tonight.  That's what counts.
Now you believe there were <u>two</u> lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand.  The second lashed to the mast.
Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left.  Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing.  But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...
What for, Sheriff?
Now this jury is gonna be lookin' at the evidence with one eye. And at you with the oth...
And what's that?
You want me to say that.
What else could it be?
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
Is it possible?
For certain, no.
Can I say something, here?
I guess you'd have to guess. Not having been there with them. Having to guess whether your husband's report was word for word accurate.
...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
Melton, on the double!  Up a chain!                                   MELTON  Sir!     MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid- stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD.     CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters.     Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then passes him. MEKUM, watching, smirks.     CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied.  His brow is knit, something's bothering him.     ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS     Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a "platform" on the chain, sixty feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.     His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a "platform" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.     Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up, three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches, neither man reveals anything at all...     LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP     CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.                                   CHURCH                    What about...spirit?
Are these your bags?
Those idiot broads!  Here we are all packed to go to Miami, and what happens?  The saxophone runs off with a Bible salesman, and the bass fiddle gets herself pregnant.  I ought to fire you, Bienstock.
Yes, Sue?  What is it?
I beg your pardon.
You know, Bienstock, there's something funny about those two new girls.
You're in Berths 7 and 7A.
Upsy-daisy.
Say, Joe - tonight's the night, isn't it?
We're not?
Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
With me?
It did?  Boy, did it ever!
It's a hundred miles, Joe - it's snowing - how are we going to get there?
Where are we running, Joe?
It's no use.  We'll never get away with it, Joe.
My name is Josephine.
How about that talent?  This is like falling into a tub of butter.
This way, Daphne.
Male and female - the moth and the flame - I ought to slug you!
What's the beef?  We're sitting pretty. We get room and board - we get paid every week - there's the palm trees and the flying fish -
You know - the old shell game.
Wise guy, huh?  Trying to louse me up -
Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!
You crazy or something?  The place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you're making like Diamond Jim Brady!  How are we going to get out of here?  How are we going to eat?
Oh - Sugar!
I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.
And your head is hot.
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
And bring the cocktail shaker.
Not you, Sugar.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
Oh, come on - you can do better than that.
No!
It's about the Florida job.
We could pass for that.
We could dye our hair.
Let me carry one of the instruments.
Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.
Well, I'll be - !  He does have a bicycle.
I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.
Now look, Nellie - if it's about last Saturday night - I can explain everything.
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
What kind of band is this, anyway?
Hey, Sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances?
We got time off for good behavior.
Afford it?
Rough?
You can't trust those guys.
Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.
I wish you'd make sure.
Your view of what?
Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?
Why?
Shell Oil?
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.
It looked so small from the beach - but when you're on it, it's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer.
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
What thing?
See?  Nothing.
Is that anything?
Anything this time?
I never knew it could be like this.
That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.
I only wish there were something I could do for you.
What's the matter, Sugar?
You'll forget him, Sugar.
PLEASE!
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
Where did they play it - in a garage on Clark Street?
Refresh my memory.
Did Kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath?
I should get going.
We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend.  I was fourteen.
Just because some slags been paid for, doesnt mean youve got to...you know.
Whats his problem?
Hey.
Its called character. God, youre predictable.
So, whats your point?
Youre not even listening.
Mission accomplished.
Mmm.
Well, he looks miserable. What were you talking about?
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macram.
No, count it, anyway.
Six thousand, right?
And you thought Id respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
Theres a guy on 81st and Madison. You get your results in 24 hours.  Do you make your lovers get tested before you sleep with them?
I swear. I dont have a signature move.
Its hard to explain.
Are you sure?
Is this for last night?
And what if I didnt want you to...to do that to me?
What?
You have had girlfriends?
You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I dont know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. Its your job. Its who you are. How would you even know if something were real?
Hi.
Like fifteen.
You pawned it.
You want me to let him in?
Shes drunk. -er than me. But I didnt really dump you, did I?
What is it you do again?
I just wanta wash my hand. It's got blood where I hurt it.
Clarence, would you tell us a story that was not true, after telling us it was?
Don't tell me about what's wrong. You come into my office as a friend and steal city files! I could have you arrested for that -- and if you give out that information to anybody, that's exactly what I'm going to do -- and I'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for! You won't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy!
There ain't no possums in this woods tonight, Daddy.
It's cold, Daddy!
Yes, sir...
David Lee...
You just came back home, Daddy. I don't wanna leave right now -- I wanna stay home and be with you.
He will... Come on, git down and act like a possum.
Ready to go, Mama!
What do they do in the white churches, Mama?
Poor creature...
Can't sleep?
Can I go day after tomorrow?
Here's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest, go into a church or railroad station -- but don't go into nobody's house, you hear me?
She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
She says I can come live with her while school goin' on, and come back home every time there ain't no school.
What's wrong with him, David?
We brought your laundry, Miss Boatwright.
It's about the Three Musketeers.
Whatcha got there?
Mama, what was we laughin' for?
Rebecca, you jest the one I wanta see.
Hi ya, Rebecca...
I bet you could use a hot cup of coffee, Nathan Lee.
How's the weather out there?
The most important thing is that you're home!  We was gonna have cold eatin' tonight, 'cause of the heat, but now, I'm goin' to cook!
There, you see?
But, Nathan--
It's the rules and I gotta follow 'em. No visitin' 'cept holidays and Sunday -- and no womenfolk anytime.
The clitoris?! I DID IT!! I FOUND THE CLITORIS!!
YOU JUST DON'T CARE!
What?
Don't worry about that. Now, I want you to say 'Doggy.'
-no Cheesy Poofs.
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
Hey Cartman.
You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.
Come on, just get to the message board!
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
You're late, Cartman!
Did you bring the pie and punch?
You guys! Seriously! You guys!
Mrphmmmph!!!
Goodnight, honey.
Eric?! Eric, what is it?!
Oh you poor dear. You've been through so much...
Hello there, children!!
Chef, what does it mean that we're at war?
Viva la Resistance.
WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!
What? What do you mean you don't belong here? Relax guy, hell is for children.
Mph rmph rm rmph rmph rm!
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?
Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny!
What? What don't I get?  What don't I get?
That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me!
It's only a matter of time before my mom has HIM burned too!
Thank you, Kenny.
Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.
Oh dear God...
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals!
The F word?!
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.
Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!
Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!
You know I do.
<b>What if I, don't wanna put out? That's all you ever say Relax put out I'm a living creature, I have feelings too, I don't need this abuse from you-</b>
Hey, I'm missing the party!
Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?!  You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.
Ow, you're hurting me!
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
Stan, I never cared for Gregory.
Evening.
Well I appreciate that.
Yes he did.  Yes he did. Barnes looks at the monitor - Taylor and the others are still in the dining room -
And what are they doing now, Mac?
If anyone can hear me please respond!
It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel!
Mac, can you hear me?  Come in?
I don't know what you're talking about!
Barnes?
It's time we lock coordinates.
You're not helping my heart condition any, Barnes!  Now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for?
This ship is going down in a blaze of glory!
So you were looking for a new challenge.
I'm sure you'll be all right.
What are we going to do?
Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
We could send Mac.  If he can retrieve one suit, we could go back for the other.
If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.
I can't let you do that.
Are you ready?
Explosive?
Taylor?
Do you want some advice?
Right now it's about 8 o'clock at home.  People are going to work, kids are going to school...
What is it?!
Thank you.
What is happening around here!!!
I'm homesick.
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor -
Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
Yeah, basement bingo.
Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.
Bowling used to be so pure, so...All- American. Breeze sings along with Caruso and pretends to conduct.
Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no 
Buzz Burger, side of 'cues. You haven't introduced me to your fan.
This scam we got going here was your 
What do you think I can do?
Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame.
Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma.
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
Watch out for that one. She's got a great average, but she's looking for a prince. And, believe me, she's 
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
What the fuck is this?
I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.
You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
Junior's a problem child. He has a thing about -
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
Where's Junior?
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.
You're just like you mother! Always jealous!
Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke!
Uh...over easy.
Isn't this technically a scooter?
Whoa.
Mind if I cut in?
You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo.
Can I ask you something personal?
Do you have a girlfriend?
Do you have a boyfriend?
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
What? Be my body guard?  Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.
I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo.
Do you talk with your mom?
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.
He's dead Sheila.
You don't get two chances with Junior.
Theo, Buzz is dead.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!
Fletcher!  Now!
Wait a minute --
Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take ... yeasts.
They told me about sixty hours.
Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.
A squid?  The size of a whale?  I don't think so.  Target acquired.  Sixty yards.
We're a habitat.  Not a castle.  The only defense we have is High Voltage.
What was that?
Increase positive pressure!
Don't do it!
Norman, please!  Don't!
Come with me.  The team's already waiting.
Anything else?
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.
You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.
He translated it wrong.  "My name is Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run."
Edmunds?
Going active.
What the hell?  It shut us down.
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
Yes, sir.
It's chipped.
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
You don't know that.
Gimme a report, I want --
It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
Edmunds?  Get in here.  I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.
A half a mile long?
Look at this.
They switched us over.
It's not talking, it's mimicking.
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
Wait a minute.
I can't feel her bones.  She's like a sponge.
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
Don't tell me to calm down!
Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.
You should know how it works.  Just in case.
You fixed my suit?
The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?
Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just nervous.
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.
Page 87.
P-a-r-a-s-o...
What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
Doesn't say.
The sphere looks different.
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
He can't manifest.
Don't, Beth.
Then where's it coming from?
Beth?
Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.
What is that?  What are you doing?
How's that?
What are you looking for?
Our habitat, I mean.  This place can't handle another attack.
This answers one of our questions.
Not a clue.
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
What do you mean?  She's not here?
I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.
Fine.
We're never gonna make it.
How much time you figure to get to the surface?
Gimme a second --
There is one possibility.
The power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  What if we feared the power to go away?
What'd you say to him?
It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.
You don't think it does?  I think it's rather obvious.
Why would this ship carry instructions in English?
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.
That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier...
By the way sir, I've read your report.  I think it's brilliant.
Must be another Johnson then.  Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight.
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
Squint harder.
Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds?  With what's out there?
Luke's got a point... ... Fear is their greatest defense... I doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on Aquilae or Sullust, and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault.
I'll get the information.
I don't see why.  I don't believe we've ever met.
I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?
I can't see!  How can I fight?
Of course, where you been kid?
I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...
The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.
I'm right behind you, Blue Leader.
We don't get many visitors.  Let's take a look at it.
I think she's going to be all right.
Is he afraid of the water?
Watch it!  Move back.
Get to the ship!
You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.
I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.
Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot...
We got reinforced. Most of'em just got outa boot...
We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.
Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way...
Yeah, but I want Carmen.
Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
Are you alright ?
Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever.
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
Eeuch !
Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...
Are you the boy for me ?
Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
Alright, take her out, Ibanez.
Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?
This isn't random or light. Someone made amistake...!
Hey, amigo, come chow with me.
What's your malfunction, Rico ?
Good good, then it's all settled.
Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach !
Oh, my, what's that ?
This came for you today. I presume on your request.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school !
We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?
I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.
Is that your signature, Rico ?
No talking please. I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ?
Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...
That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.
Let's go.
Can you walk ?
What is your position ?
Warm it all up ! Everything you got ! Levy, collect the big guns from the towers. Watkins, put General Owen with the wounded. Rico, where's my communications ?
Where is Lt. Ilia?
Disclose the information.
Our data is being prepared.
You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator.
Departure angle on viewer.
... but I still recommend further simulation study.
You saved the ship.
We could have cut it off at the main computer...
Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens.
Jim... he <U>wants</U> it.
Negative control from inertial lag will continue 22 point five seconds before forward velocity slows to sub-light speed.
'Commander' Decker?
Time to impact...?
Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...
I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical.  Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them.  Where is Captain Decker?
Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.
Admiral, the Enterprise has just finished eighteen months redesign- ing and refitting. She needs testing, a shakedown...
It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           
V'ger plans to literally <U>meld</U> to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...
Why aren't you on board?
Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott.
Starfleet signals, sir, growing in strength...  They -- have Intruder on their monitors -- it's decelerating -- powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate...
Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.
Cal...
Go you Huskies?
...small town.  I suppose.  You have to make your own fun.
Northern Books.  What can I do for you?
I want to rent this one.
That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
...that...that he <u>prayed</u> for a second chance.  But...do you see?
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
The, the, the, the <u>sanctity</u> of everyday things...
How can you <u>say</u> that?
I <u>can</u>?
What I need to <u>say</u>...
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
Fix my glasses.
I'm gonna be your typist for this evening.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
...yes.
Because it's about <u>purity</u>...
That's right...
Where you going?
No, that's true.
Best way I know to get ink on your hands.
To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
But it'll stop the movie.
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
Drama Group?
Waal, <u>there</u> you are, and Have I Got Some News for <u>You</u>...
I'm sorry.
I know em, I don't know what order they come in...
<u>Wonderful</u> scr...
Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
<u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America.
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
Because, because...we don't <u>have</u> to build an Old Mill -- they <u>have</u> an Old Mill -- <u>yeah</u>.  It's on a stream -- that's where you <u>put</u> a mill.
It's Marty on the Coast -
What is that in fingers...?  Just kidding, get me this horse.
Well, I can offer you something to drink?
Nice town that you've got here.
No, you're absolutely r...
If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.  How long since you almost went to jail for this shit?
I'm very sorry to...
Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, <u>but</u>...
Aren't you ever in school?
Izzat so?
Nobody.
...wants a piece...
Not now, I'm talking to the press. Claire!
An artist of your caliber...
...yes...
...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community <u>respects</u> her.  Please don't go.  Please don't go.  What can I do but beseech you...?  Trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...?  When...?
Claire:  As an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  Stay with me.  I need you.  We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to <u>us</u>.  Stay.  Stay.  Tonight...when...  When they've gone.  Let's talk.  Let's <u>really</u> talk.  We could, we'll have <u>dinner</u>, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...
Hello.
...little woman has gone crazy about our dinner party...City Council...?  What's the trouble...?
Doug, the traffic light...
...he's the producer of the movie.
She was in the car with Bob Barrenger last night.  And she was injured coming home from a love tryst, so...
I...
What's in the case?
Could you tell me where a fellow goes to get a drink in this town?
Does it have to be an Old Mill?  Where have you been?
The movie's about <u>purity</u>.  So we don't <u>show</u> her breasts.  We show them to <u>him</u>, her back to the camera.
Thank God, it's up to you, Pal.  Sup to you...
I don't getcha.
You can't write it?
How do you know you saw it?
You didn't see it...
You cool the broad out?
I don't got the money.
Pay her off.
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
Yeah?
Do something.
I have to tell you, I can not <u>express</u> to you how <u>happy</u>...
You hear that?
She coulda done better than him.
You see where Tom Miller's playin' the Old Farmer?
Where are we?
No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
I hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt...
I didn't say that.  Why would I say that?
Like who?
What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops.  I fear for the women and the property values.
Daddy was washing Rachel.  In the shower.  What did you think that was about?
How would you know sh...
So why are you asking me?
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
That happens.  To families.
...I mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. She's like still a kid, herself.
I said...
You forgot to wash my purple shirt.  I told you a hundred times it was Purple Day at school today.
Never mind.  I'll just eat my lunch.
I'm gonna beep daddy at work.
I don't have to listen to you!  You're not my mother.
That doesn't bother me.
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
I hate her.  I really hate her.
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
&quot;Goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben!
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
That I do.  Always will.
I'm fine, ba...
If a soldier loses his legs in a war.  Is he the same guy?  Sure he is.
Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.

Something's up wi...
I've been with someone for quite some time, and didn't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly.  But after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids I might add -- she moved in last month.
Rachel's not half my age.
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
Thank you Mrs. Franklin.  Jackie?  This has been very valuable for us.  And I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight.
You ask me that counselor's making a mountain out of a molehill...
Called him.  We set an ap...
I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...
It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there.
We...
It's temporary.
Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?
What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you?
Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
She already hates me.  You've seen to that.
I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park.
My boss.
Moi?
And you said...?
I really look like shit.
You try to center on the big issues, y'know.  What it's all about.  What this whole trip has meant.  But then, the <u>really</u> big issues keep swamping y...
The primo stuff is great for pain.
You really didn't have to come, you know.  I'd have brought them straight t...
Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.
You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!
I just found out I have to go to Boston to get a deposition.  I might not be back until Saturday.
But?  But what?
And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
Oh my God.  Are you serious?
Everything's gonna work out.  The kids and I...we're going to love each other.
They're my kids.
No problem.
Why in the world would she t...
She called it a fight.  <u>The</u> fight.
I told her I loved her.
You heard me: leave the table!
There are some rumors...
No prob. I'm cool.
Marty, ignore him.
Nice to have you here.
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
Consuelo. Are you crying?
Who is Jesus?
Maybe it's for the bestI mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrongPeople who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?
But still, you can't be sure.
Why was he on Death Row?
Consuelo, what is rape exactly?
I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY  Good.
Marty...
Sure!...
Was anyone in my room today?
We did the same thing last year also.
You've lost interest...You hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
What DO you know?
OK.
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
...gger.
Nigger.
Fuck me hard!
I hate reading.
Who is this?
Yeah. But not any more.
Huh. Kids?
OK. Bye.
Is it loaded?
I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why.
Hey, um, Toby? I was wonderingIs the documentary almost finished?
Can I see what you have so far?
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
Uh-oh!  Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?
I'll lead.
I said I'll lead.
I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
Forget about it.
Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
I'm going first.  Taking the fire. If we go out together we're all dead!
Come on, drink up.
Looks like Richter isn't acting alone--he's heading into some dangerous waters.
So, what are we looking at White?
Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
He wouldn't take it on the helicopters. He'd transport it through pipelines that connect Chemco to the waterfront...
How goes the roll call?
Something tells me you don't want to be on TV, friend.
I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...
Thank you, Admiral.
If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
What's the meaning of this?
Yes?
Excuse me, Mister President, but you forgot to give me my camera back.
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
Okay, fella.  But just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me.
So what?
I didn't say anything.  What's the meaning of disturbing me at this hour, Colonel?
Well, that's ridiculous.  If the teleprinter and radio links are out of order, just pick up a phone and pay for a call.
You aren't sure!
Yes, sir.  One thing, Mister President.
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
Yes, sir.
Why do you think I ask?
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
No calls from inside out.  No calls from outside in are even answered.  No calls.
No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.
I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing.
Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?
I see you're playing your radio, Major. Isn't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base?
But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
I suppose we might catch them off their guard.
Well, I know they've been going on for years, and they haven't gotten any place.
Do you think they would cheat?
Major, those are my boys out there dying.
To peace on earth, Major.
How long will it take to receive them all?
Look, he's there, and you're here.
Yes?
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
Check.
Shouldn't be bad.  Might even help.  But my guess is we're going to have to paddle our way back.
They can't touch us at this height.
I thought I should check out the damage first. My gear is busted up pretty bad.
So am I.
What does it look like?
That's what I said.
Fusing for ten thousand air burst.
How do you know he's dead?
He's dead, all right.
They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it.
There are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose.
We crossed the coast over an hour ago. Okay?
Are you sure?
Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?
I asked you a question, Lothar!
I thought I'd go along for the ride.
Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
It was pretty bad, huh?
Yeah, but, when I was walking, I realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? He's not free. He's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.
That was really great.
Slides go with it.
Uh, home, you know.
Your a nurse?
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
Stuck with what guy?
You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
Don't let 'em fight.
Hey, you know me.
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
What?
Yeah, man.
Yeah.
I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your fucking legs. Take 'em off.
Pony? What's a "pony"? You mean that geek who played the folk music at the senior prom? What's that guy's name? Neil Moynihan?
You better! Yes!
He paid you man.
Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain.
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.
Thanks. See man?
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
Yeah!
You got everything right but the car. My dad didn't get me a BMW.
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
You know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.
Oh, wow.
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.
Hi.
Nice to meet you Sooze.  Hi, I'm Erica.
Uh-huh.
You don't need to sit next to me right now.
Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.
I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib.
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her?
Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.
Jeff, stay there.
Hey, w-why don't you see if he's hiring, you know? Get an application?
Why we're just standing here.
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof!  How is she?
Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.
Your completely missing the point.
What?
Of course.
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
No, I don't.
Gee, Jeff, I thought you were gonna go take a piss, not join some alcoholic nudist colony.
To his hotel?
I've run out of words.
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
Hey, Pony.
So you think I should?
Now?
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
Look Pakeesa...
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
Is that your driver?
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
So? What's L.A. like?
Like?
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.
Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!
Soon.
What's that supposed to mean?
I hate it here. It's so ugly, it's like being dead. You got out of here, you know? I'm ready to go.
Me?
Is that Jeff?
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Tim?
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
No, see, Neil, if you're fucking with one of my friends, then you're fucking with me.
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Could you give me a ride?
I'm going out later.
The fuck not?
Fuck.
Ahh!  Baby's got two heads!!!
Another sex dream?
Use the bathroom, because the Port-a Potties on the field are gross.
Thanks, Cleo.  See you tomorrow.
Oh my G-d, I read about this!  It's called a "pregnancy insanity."  Quick, she needs a sitz bath --
Okay, even with all our savings, it's still only six hundred fifty-four.
Hi, Jack.
I know, but that was before.
Let me explain something...
Anyway, last time I checked, you still had to have sex to have an orgasm.  And I know she ain't seen the lord on all fours - so I'm just saying.
It was Lucy!  Lucy went to the cops!
Don't use big bills!
Yeah?
Ammo?
And Hannah, you could give your share to your church - or maybe buy one of those hungry little kids Sally Struthers advertises.
Screw Lucy!
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
Oh well, then I'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals.
You got that big retarded girl down there?
Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone.  Promise!
Yeah.  This summer at church camp?  I'm pretty sure I had, y'know, an orgasm.
I don't hate you.  I need your help.
My best friend got pregnant.
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
Kansas, I want you to meet someone special.
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
I hate to think where that puts me.  I could be her father.
Roll 'em.
Wait a minute.  This is the woman I love.  What's going on? Who was loaded?
It's from hunger.
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
Name dropper.
You forgot this.
I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
So do I.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
I'll say.  This is solid gold.
I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.
What happened?
Gordon Cole?
It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
How much will it be?  I warn you - don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich.
I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire.  I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house.
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?
Who else ?
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
Well?
I will not have it butchered.
Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
There sure is.
Cut away from me?
They've come for my car.
Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station.  And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants.  Max, what's a good men's shop in town?  The very best... Well, go there !
Not on the same floor with Valentino!
The other guests?
Norma, I can't take it.  You've bought me enough.
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
Go away.  Go to that girl of yours.
I hope you realize, Norma, that scripts don't sell on astrologers' charts.
How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.
You'd better get to bed yourself.
I made your bed this afternoon.
She was the greatest.  You wouldn't know.  You are too young.  In one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters.  Men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails.  There was a Maharajah who came all the way from Hyderabad to get one of her stockings.  Later, he strangled himself with it.
I'm talking to you.  My clothes and things are up in the room.
Is that so!
How come?
What's the matter, Max?
What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours?
Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.
Now wait a minute.  If we made it a girls' softball team, put in a few numbers.  Might make a cute musical: It Happened in the Bull Pen -- the story of a Woman.
Bring something to drink.
Paramount is calling.
Cameras? ...What is it, Max?
But what will happen?
Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
I don't feel like it right now.
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
We're from different worlds.
I don't love you any more.
But what if---it wasn't real?
You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.
Hey! Ethan!
Oh no, not you again.
Why should I believe you?
They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?
Someone's chasing him.
I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.
I am almost an adult. This is what I want.
She did that deliberately.
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop.
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
I just did. Because I have the Power.
Nigel, get lost.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
The Danvers. And two of your little friends.
You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
What's it like?
Where is inner space?
I was on Earth...
...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."
There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here.
But it's impossible.
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
You can use the wand.
What's that? Never saw anything like that.
S'not bad, s'very good, but... y'know what's wrong with this... Singapore...thing?
Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
Lana Lang. How great to see you.
No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
-- but you  deserve the vacation, Lois.
Do you really know Superman?
But my Uncle Al, on my father's side, he won't eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. So my mother told my Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's half-sister, I told you that, right?
Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
What kind?
The boss wants to see you.
Please, Mr. Webster, you're a great humanitarian. Ain't you heard what it's like in them jails? You send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and...
Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee!
Turn on the T.V.
Uh...what channel were you watching?
It ain't. It's nowhere. It blew up. That's how come they shipped the dude to Earth when he was a baby.  well. I know some stuff too, y'all.
That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
Now...when do I get a taste?
Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
Yeah? How's it look?
Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got --  Hey, what y'all doin' up there?!
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
There's no rush.
Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white.
I thought you'd never get here.
Ross, honey, it's time for your massage...
Mr. White, the next number, please?
I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!
He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.
Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
Lois, I usually do.
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
Clark, everything I was saying -- can't you see I only say it because I really care?
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
Oh Clark, no!
You don't have anything to be sorry 	about.  How could I . . .
I'm listening.
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have to tell me. That's what I did all night -- I "listened to the voices of  reason" till the dawn came up. Do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you've been up night crying?
What else could I do?
Everything on it?
What??
You'll miss the battle of the century!
Mr. White, the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page.
Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --
The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty -
Where?
No, Jor-El, the baseball player that came from Porto Rico. Yes Jor-El your Jailer.
Oh, General, the world is a big place. Thank goodness, my needs are small...As  it turns out, I have this affinity for beachfront property . . .
No drinks . No movie. This is the last time I take a charter flight.
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?
Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with Superman about his peace mission . . .
Gee, I don't think . . .
. . . Please leave your message at the beep.
It's just a bad flu, really. How did you know . . .
Superman? Has something happened to him?
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
Awesome!
No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
But he's never there.
What's that?
Boy, are you gonna get it.
We'll all fry.
What I need this for?
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
You'd better get a new alarm clock. The chief has been hollering for you.
A hot story, huh?
Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you?
Mom...
I'd like to.
I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.
Hey!
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
It wasn't a trick!
There weren't any wires. I looked.
Oh, what a chance! If I could just  --  get to him.
Besides that.
Why does it all mean so much to you? All the time, 'land, land, land.'
I needed this, Y'know? I really needed this. just when I'm nearing the fruition of my project, Big Bird flies into town.  Go ahead! Kill me by inches! Put me on the agony rack!
Damn!  This will get him.
I'm going to bed.
Meteorites!
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
Don't let me down.
No news is not good news. Y'know
You're not going to hit me?
I mean the other one!
I have sworn to uphold the laws of Krypton.
Will you abide by the Council's opinion?
Well - gotta change that tire if were gonna get home.
All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
Here's the story on that East 19th Street murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to me.
Lois, take Kent there and introduce him around
If one of you can get that  -- I mean, I want the real Superman. Who is he? Where's he from? What's his favorite ball team? What's up?
Do as I say. Let go!
Superman???
The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
Can you really see through anything?
Do you like pink?
Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?
I broke the man out of prison --
I gave him this new face.
Well  --  you've got me! What can I say?
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
Well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing.
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.
Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.
What happened?
Say hi to Zoe.
My name is...
I understand.
I can help you.
Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help.
They just finished supper.
She said she's got to be home by nine.
I have to.
Why did you do that, Billy?
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.
I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened.  That's how I remembered it.  But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty.  Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then?
You've talked to Billy?
Excuse me?
He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole.  He looked frightened.
You hate it.
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
It's for the school bazaar.
You want a cup of tea or something?
We've only got honey.
Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey?  Want me to fix you something?
The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty...
It's like a song.
I want to sit beside you tomorrow.
Nicole?
I don't want you to lie.
There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior?
Note my objection.  She said, 'As I'm talking.'
Tell me about the Ottos.
Yes.
Why can't you talk to me?
News?
I can hear you breathing, Daddy.
Some more wine?
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.
Dolores?
So you're just the thing we need.
What time in the morning was this?
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
Why were you scared?
You could see the speedometer?
How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going?  To the best of your recollection?
There wasn't time?
The door needs a lock.
That's too high.  I'll never reach it.
He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.
Well, there's the Hamiltons.  Joe and Shelly Hamilton.
That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town.  He's about to lose his house and car.
Loretta...Sidney Falco...
You ought to stop this nonsense, Loretta, these two dollar bets.
Hello, Sidney.  Wanna table?
Come on boys, break it up...
I could think of better places to meet her, instead of here.  He lives on the whole top floor.
Joe, give my nephew a drink.
That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
Take it easy, Susie.  He wouldn't be much of a man if he didn't understand my concern.  Would you, son?
Does he have to be here in our hair?
Frankly, son, you lost me on that last hill.  Just give us the punch line...
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
Then whose fault was it, J.J.?  It was someone's fault, wasn't it?
Susie likes to keep her girlish secrets.  But in her heart of hearts I imagine, Dallas, that she fancies you in an uncommon way. Now, what about YOU, son?  Not just tom-catting around...I hope?
Err...the Supreme Court story, I was telling you - Justice Black.
Hello, Harry.
I know Manny Davis.
What, some cheap, gruesome gags?
No, lemme finish.  I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB!  That boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head.  And Susan, like you said, she's growing up.  Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!
Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!
What does that mean - integrity?
What are you so chipper about?  If I put a cross on every one of your mistakes, you'd look like a graveyard!
Sidney, I told you -
I was trying to build her up, not tear her down -
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...
Don't you ever get messages, Eyelashes?  I called you twice.
Avidly.  He was staring.
Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell.
Don't you know who that man is?
What do you want all of a sudden - Lady Godiva...?  Where's my other shoe?
A girl needs a little romancing before she -
What would you think of me if -
So what'll you do if I feel nervous? You'll open your meaty, sympathetic arms...?
I put a lotta trust in you, Chickie...
Where's those glossy prints you promised?  Tonight's the latest I can place them -
I'm feeling too good to fight with you, but that isn't what I said - I said you snoop.  For instance, what were you doing around my hotel the other night?
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?
Don't run away - I was always the man for you!  I'm talking to you out of two years of silence - listen to what I say!  Inside of six months -
J.J., if you think -
This is big, you know.  Very big! Let's go out later, drink some firewater.  With the boys.  Fred can call Millie and -
You haven't told him yet...
His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in.  He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.
Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could come.
No!  I'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother!
Steve, I feel exhausted...what do you want me to do?
We should abort.
Do you have bandages?
No good.
Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that? You can't just go around killing people!
How long do you live?  I mean, last?
Affirmative.
That's great!  See, you're getting it.
We're not gonna make it, are we?  People, I mean.
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
You will.
Why do you cry?
"No fate."  No fate but what we make.  My father told her this... I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- Never mind.  Okay, the whole thing goes "The future is not set.  There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."
This is tactically dangerous.
Your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?
Out of the way, John!
It, John.  Not him.  It.
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.
I love you.  I always will.
I know!
You broke my arm!
You're already dead, Silberman.  Everybody here dies.  You know I believe that.  So don't fuck with me!
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
On Furtwngler.
You represent the United States now. We have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just.
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
'Please remember that Dr. Furtwngler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'
Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major Arnold. Sir.
So, what does the Russki want?
David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive?
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
You have a question for Helmuth, David?
Isn't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor's baton, isn't that true?
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwngler?
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
And suddenly, Steve, suddenly you notice that they like you. They honour you, suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world, for example.
Let Furtwngler go. Please.
Bruckner's Seventh, Major.
Your guess is as good as mine.
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
How?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
No, because I had only one intention. My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics.
That's an outrageous lie!
I have illegitimate children.
Stop this, please, stop this now!
Do you know what that is?
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
It's Dr. Furtwngler's baton, which I stole.
Show me.
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.
I've remembered something else...
Goebbels, yes, Josef Goebbels said, 'There's not a single filthy Jew left in Germany on whose behalf Dr. Furtwngler has not intervened.' No, no one could have been less of a Nazi than Dr. Furtwngler.
He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.
Dr. Furtwngler is a great musician. He actively opposed the Nazis and later on he helped many Jews to escape.
Yes, Chuck?
Mission control to Chuck, come in...
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
What do you think?
Not lately.  Did you check messages?
Pay attention.  The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.  But these are new.  They look human.  Sweat, bad breath, everything.  Very hard to spot.  I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him.
There's so much...
You cold?
Thanks a lot.
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
Hot dogs?
My whole life has been combat.
Don't say that.
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...
...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.
Call her.
My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.
It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that?
I could fight you on this.
Do you know what to do?
Alright... okay...
This is nuts.
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
Long story.  I found this key in the mouth of a wooden Harlequin.
That's classic.
What exactly do you do?
Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.
They're watching.
What are you doing... ?
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.
Where'd you get that... ?
Hi.  Didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
One brother, one sister.
Julliard, yeah.
They gave me a free jacket at the door.
You need anything?
They make your life fun.  Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
You've heard of it.  You've seen other people having it.  They're an entertainment service, but more than that.
It doesn't matter...
Tell me where we're going.
How did those... ?
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?
It's just a t.v.  He's just an actor.
I'll explain someday.
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
It's different every time.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
One guarantee.  Payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.
Where'd you pick up your checks?
Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
There were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room.  We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior.
What?
What gentleman, Maria?
"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.
Anything wrong... ?
Just what I told you.
Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely, don't thank me.
You know what I love about wine that comes in bottles like this?
Hi, Luke Sanderson, bad sleeper, I'm your basic tosser-turner, and you are...
Welcome Home Eleanor.  Welcome Home?  I've never been here.  Who did this?
That could have been worse.
I didn't do it.
We're fucked.  We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.
You don't believe in the paranormal.
You wrote that you had trouble sleeping.
All the carvings.
Someone is playing with you.
I don't know.
Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...
I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance.  Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell.  A communal story.  Someone starts it.  Then we all add a little more to it. And then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it.  This story shapes what we see and hear.  We interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. I started our story when I gave you the history of Hill House. You've added to it.  That's what this experiment has all been about.  That's what it was about, the experiment's over.  I'm pulling the plug.  This is my fault.
You hear the vibrations in the wire.  There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it.  I could test it.
Oh God, we can't get out!
That's where she hanged herself.
They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?
Well, it wasn't me.  Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and...  You said the Good Doctor was with you.
My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea.  It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls.  Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell.  Do you know what I mean?
Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second?  Why wouldn't you be afraid?  Really afraid.
This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!
Adhara.  I told your father, if you're looking for a name, you can't go wrong with a constellation.
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
It's not a compliment.
How'd you like to kill someone for me?
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
What kind?
Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.
You think I'm staying?
You broke last time.
Fuck you.
CQ what?
I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family.
This bloke she was bunked up with.  This Terry what'sit.
Coulda happened to anyone, man.  I never knew her to be reckless.  I mean, sure, she would smoke a little grass, or something, have a few drinks.  But that's it, nothing more than that.
No.  Not at all.  Do we?
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
Who'd you butcher at the house?
What?
Bring the motor around.  Bang out in front, right?
Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.
Too easy?
Do you have any friends, man?
Same.
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
I thought maybe you just came for the ride.
In any case, I don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.
... No, I went in for more improving pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses.
Weren't you on a television series?
Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.
It didn't discourage you, though.
Minor officials bother you, don't they?
How far?
Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.
Of the deal, man.
Where is he now?
I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
You sure?
What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
How we gonna get that lucky?
Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred --
Is he here?
Pleasure.
Ann--
...You don't like the music out there?
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
...Mm.
Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.
Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.
A goose, friend. I was chasing a wild goose. Ed, have you ever heard of venture capital?
Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!
...Was that a pass?
Pretty straightforward, but I don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer--
She's a rare one.
...Say, where do you get those things anyway?
Uh-huh.
...Oh, Jesus.
...It ruined me. This money. No annex. I'm all shot to hell.
...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money?
Come on, get ready. It's important.
...I don't know what happened to Big Dave. I know some of it. Irregularities in my books, they said. Can I explain it.
...Doris--
I knew about it. Big Dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money.
...and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women...
No thanks.
I'm fine.
Yeah. What do I, uh...
'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender.
...You ever wonder about it?
I don't know... How it keeps on coming. It just keeps growing.
You don't got a headache?
Birdy... I didn't mean to--
Second chair.
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.
If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence.
That thing won't come after us, right?  It's going for bigger game. The group blundering around in the basement.  Poor fools.
For Chrissake, I'll do it.  What's the combination?!
Fifteen... what's next?
I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
Who are you?  The undertaker?
The body?
We need light in here, stat.
I've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than "the dog ate my homework".
What happened to them?
Saliva test?  You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?
I don't like animals.  Never have. Dog bit me when I was little.  After that I gave up on pets.  Animals are irrational.  Give me a psychotic killer any day.  If there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain.  My first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo.  It was late August.  Over ninety.  The polar bear was inside his cave.  Kids didn't know he was in there.  All they saw was the pool. They got to swimming and splashing. The noise woke up the bear.  By the time I arrived, both little boys were in pieces.  The bear was dragging one kid around by the foot. I can still hear the mother screaming --
I think I should come with you.
I smell it.  It's here.
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
Did you hear that?  My God.  He says that Mbwun is real!
Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed?
Lieutenant!  It's me.
What's that?
Please.  Don't humiliate me further.
With all due respect, dear, that's bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  You've left me in the dust.
This isn't a death sentence.  Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.
What is it?
Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus protein.  That explains why the computer's confused.  The plant's infected with a virus.
What's going on?
None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.
How many storage areas are there?
We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.
What's that?
We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
Not that big.
They were yellow!
Oh... my... God!
For once I'm glad you're rumor central.  What in the world is going on?
What do you make of it, Margo?
4-monoxytocin is... "A hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland."
Is Dr. Frock safe!
Got to finish this thesis sometime.
Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in Belem, Venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. A taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat.  That boat washed up in my district.  Everyone on board was killed.
That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldn't leave me alone.
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
I don't understand.
I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.
Dr. Green...
You're not.  Where is it?
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
Then it won't go after the others?
No!  Don't kill him!  Pendergast, you were right.  It's John!
It's the busy season.
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.
I thought you were in a hurry.
You want to book the flight?
What happened down there?
Give me a shot from Truman's ring.
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
Of course, there hasn't been anything to compare with this - the first time an intruder has been a former cast member--
Let's talk ratings.  "Truman" has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few days--how do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself?
Are we talking Emmies?
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--
How can they have a child?
Lauren, right?
I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon.
Marlon--
I've got to talk to you.
What're we doing here, Truman?
I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.
Hi, honey.  Look at this.  It's a "Chef's-Mate."  Dicer, slicer and peeler in one.  Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.
Where have you been?
Come on, Truman.  Haven't you studied enough?
Arrah!
I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday.  I thought I'd make my potato salad.  Remind me--
Let's go now.
Why don't I make you some of this new Mococoa Drink?  All natural.  Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners--
What the hell has that got to do with anything?  Tell me what's happening?!
Stop this now.  I'll do it.  I swear.
You look very pale, Truman.  Are you taking your vitamin D's?
It doesn't sound insane, Truman.  I swear I see him ten times a week--in a hundred faces.  I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday.
Is there any way around?
They're going to stop me talking to you.
What am I doing here?
I hope to. We're working to develop this evidence --
How's that?
Who sent you?
I think you're full of shit.
See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?
What was it?
You found something?
You didn't know my father --
Jesus, Mulder...
Something's not right...
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
What? What are you talking about?
Why?
What did you find?
And you've never seen anything like that?
This looks like new grass to you?
Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
Been where?
This is weird, Mulder.
What? What's wrong?
I have. I did. It's done.
Well, call General McAddie.
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
Is she alive?
I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed.
Until Dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
Where is he?
My god...
We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
He hates me.
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
Catherine?  I'm about to start.  If you want me to wait, or...
Damn him.
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
This is Stargher we're talking about?
Remember, Julia Hickson is priority number one.  Nothing else matters.  Find out where she is.
Wait...
He's mine?
They're hungry.
Who says?
Agent Cole.
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
What about the cat?
Here he is.
Breeders typically destroy albino pups, so this animal is truly unique.
After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
You were awfully good.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
No.
What's she talking about?
Can I hear you?
H-E-Z-T...
Seemed like a good idea.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
Let's go away.
I wish I knew.
I'm going back home.
What is on your mind? Why did you hide?
Did he say anything about me - tell me?
...anyway?
He works in a military hospital.
They are - private - letters.
I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.
We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?
Can you tell me whose...
My name is Calloway.
You a friend of Lime's?
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you? You could do with a drink.
Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame.
Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?
And there was a third man there. I suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you.
It wouldn't work.
Calloway!
A girl of spirit.
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
Write her out a receipt, Paine. Give her a receipt for these letters too.
...excuse me.
You do!
Welcome?
Mr. Crabbin.
Striptease, sir.
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...
Hmm.
What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I?
Unwise, Holly...
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.
...this way.
You really liked it?
Speak English?
Coffin?
Baron Kurtz.
You remember me? Upstairs...
Something wrong.
Where are you staying?
Lime.  Harry Lime.
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
I'll share something with you.
It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to.
We think in miles, not kilometers.
Richard - I saw a fin!
What about Moliere?
We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.
Hi.
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
Didn't you see <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>?
What, do you like it here?
You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.
Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a different moment. Things were possible that aren't now.
The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
Which is what?
What's he care about?
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.
When can I see you?
I'm coming to your room tonight.
Do you know it like that? By heart.
Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.
Fuck that.
Nazis talk about it all the time.
You want a punch in the mouth?
No. What are you looking for?
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod.
Why are you taking that?
Is it okay if I record this?
The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?
And? WHat did you notice?
Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?
You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?
And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.
No!
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.
Do you feel you're making progress here?
Tell it to Hitler.
What is it?
That's all we've got left.
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
And what did you do?
The Torah says not to light a fire on the Sabbath, because it's work, correct?  But if alternating current's running through the wires every second of every day, and I throw a switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire?
So what?
Does he know?
And you...?  Do you love Enzo?
You're leaving?
Johana, am I boring you?
My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.
He looks strange, doesn't he? Like a baby that just learned to walk.
And the lights!  Running lights, stealing stretchers...!  You'll have us in jail.
Okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk.
What else is there?
How did it happen?
Where did you get that?
Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board?!
And... does the voice come back?
Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman!  How is the little Frenchman?
Jacques, my friend, how are you?
I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
I remember.  Hi Roberto!
It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere else.
... Everything.
What?
Can I come in?
I give you this.  You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
That's good.
... How long was I asleep?
Tea... or whiskey?
Please, have a seat.
But what brought you to Sicily?
No, no.  You'll like it.  It's superb.
Yes... Maybe... I don't know.  I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun.  Don't you think?
Jacques, you set a world record.
I'm being a pain, huh?
What?
Jacques?  I'm pregnant.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.
Are you crazy?  I have no use for a woman!  Since my accident.
Uncle Louis!
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?
I changed the lock you son of a bitch!
It's his heartbeat.
I thought you said he was Peruvian?
Does that have a hidden meaning?
What is it honey... the frenchy?
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
... And those?
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
Who... Who is that?
... The truck fell into a very deep crevasse.  We weren't able to save the equipment.
He's in the fluoroscope now.  Listen to his heart.  Impressive, huh? The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore.  It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.
Okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible.  We can't send you new equipment until our file is complete.  Okay?
So why the long face?
Please. Will you help me?
So. Do you have a name?
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
That got annoying fairly quickly.
What!?
Your mother was right. You do work too hard.
Esther!
Shabat Shalom mama. I brought some Manischewitz. The black label.
Mordechai. Do you love your mother?
I don't want to argue with you. Let's just eat in peace.
...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.
Happy Hanukkah Tikva.
Okay, what's the information?
Cool. What's it do?
Sorry folks, I don't do couples.
Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.
Then what do you do?
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
Sure, I like my leopards
Charlie wasn't drunk last night.
I want him to lock me up.
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed - He'll come up with something.
You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
It could be a man.
Yes, but what sort of a man?
Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect.
It was you, Galbraith!
You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight --
Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?
What do you do now?
Get it out of here!
That's easy. Me.
You're too good to me.
You look swell in that threealarm number --
Suppose I slip them a few bucks  for the funeral expenses.
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
Kiki -- it wasn't the leopard.
No. No, thanks.  Now we've got to do it ourselves.
All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says closed to the public, doesnt it?
That might depend on where youre going.
By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistresss brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?
Three weeks ago. To borrow money. I wasnt here but he got to my husband, sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made. Carlos handed over 1,000 to get rid of him.
I wont comment on the time but youll understand if I dont tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard. 
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
I found this at your brothers.
You seem surprised. Could it be you dont think that badly of him after all?  You neednt worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.
I still dont buy your story but I figured it cant do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry. Besides, if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner, we could always get the right people onto you. I trust you know who I am talking about.
Im impressed. That information could have cost me 20,000.
Huh! Really? Hotels?
Minimizes the risks. Children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses. These can also be used to move women and drugs... Anything that makes money really.
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
Im really sorry you were not called...
Black suits you.
You do have a vivid imagination, Mr Lombard. I only wish youd use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious. I fail to understand your purpose in this. Still, say what youre owed if you still wish to be paid or get out, all right?
How... When did you...
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? Hes a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
Your brother stumbled upon Adoniss little secret, didnt he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more.  Leon didnt come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kids life. Your flunkey let him in, so his visit couldnt be concealed, hence the exhibition story. There was no exhibition. Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah? Leon does his own prints. Wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his Art.  I should have paid more attention to your words. Perhaps its the way you say them...
What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
To get me killed...?
So you did talk about it, huh?
Why the hell couldnt you divorce the man?
Youre sure you wont sit down, Miss Stewart?
You dont know why hes come to Los Angeles?  The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his?
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what were doing here?
Get a pen and dont ask any questions.
Friedmans dead... They killed him...
No one saw me but the Italian and a dog. I blew up their generator. They thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing. It might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up...
Then find another way.
...Im Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this thats who I am. Do you get what Im fucking saying, Mr Lombard?
Nothing sticks to slime, Emily.  This should cover what you lent me.
Hi...
Im calling about the puppies.
What sort of puppy are you looking for?
How much of a hurry are you in?
Im afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...
Whats this place? A hotel of some kind?
There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where are the other five?
Whats the Ambassador?
Have you heard of a French film called La Collectionoose?
I dont know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
Oh... We split up.
Id appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you cant, dont worry about it. Ill call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but Im in a hurry. 
Good afternoon, Mrs...?
Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
Look at it this way. He might achieve everything your son never did.
Problems?
You seem very sure about that.
What is?
Its about the puppy. You got the money?
Leon? No. Im afraid he left.
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
Is she on the phone?
Fine...
Le montage, lemballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors stuff. How much would it cost me?
Three...
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
They lost their son. Why?
Are they still operative?
What do you think?
My dear Aulon, to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood!
Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.
What do you fear most now... my sword?  ... or his hands?
Listen, please accept my apologies for... you know, me pretending to be the... well it wasn't really my idea... well, yes it was my idea but...
Better today than tomorrow.
I'll go.
I don't know it.  I feel it.
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!
Do as I say!
My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even...  ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!
No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?
Why?
Arrest them!
Who's running this trial, you or her?  I can't believe it!  This wretched girl -- how dare she speak to us like that?
Whose side are you on, Cauchon?
Quick -- hide in here...
Oh, thank you Lord!  I'm so glad to see you!  I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now?
The English??
You will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked.
It is for us to determine whether you are a good Christian, not you.
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?
So how would you put it?
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
... as always, majesty...
When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
So... what is the message?
Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  Answer me?!
And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
Brilliant idea... but to be really effective, why not send a whole army of virgins?
God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him!  Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.
I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!
There must be something we can do for her for Chrissakes!
Jeanne... we're not enough...
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
Besides, what about these...?
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?
I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life!  But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...
Physicians are a waste of time. You'll have more luck with this charm of mine... it saved my life at Agincourt!
Prepare these as battering-rams!
Who... who are you...?
What are you doing out here?
I am true -- to my Lord, the King of Heaven.  He knows how much I love him -- that's all that matters to me...
Why were you yelling like that?!
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
You know what you just signed, Jeanne?  You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion.  You see?  In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
You think you are ready now?
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
So... everything sounds... wonderful?
I don't want to wait for his call.
Dorota!
And how's Yurek?
What did I tell you?
The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
Have you seen this?
Can you help us?
The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
But...they won't get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw!
You sell anything?
It's not funny.
Otherwise what?
What are you reading?
Very appropriate.
Ah, here. Today's news from the other side.
Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty.  That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets.
You know what? You treat me like dirt!
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more.  But.
Well you stopped combing your hair, which is a good thing, it was looking over done.  You see these are the slits that the heads will go through, show him Nessie ... they'll be dead, the Reverend is going to use animal blood, no doubt it will be very dramatic. Tea! 
I thought she met your father in Luxemburg.
I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.
They want more money. They are trying to make two days out of it?
T-w~e-l-v~e.
I don't think you should have given up the piano. I will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on to sheets and...
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
Wash them again.
What did she say?
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.
Mama.
All right if I look around your lobby?
Give it to me!  Please.  I gotta know it's all there!
You got a bag or somethin?
What the hell you gonna do with yourself?
We'll put Salino on it.  I need somebody careful.
How do you like that Coleman, huh? After three years.
No, we checked his story with a tipster.  He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set it up for threes and nines.  I'll cut it in on his deal.
I know I give him four threes.  We can't let him get away with that.
You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money.  And no matter how much you take from his, he'll get more.
Right down to my socks, turkey.  If I'da been half as scared a that lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em.  Lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death.
He's waitin' for you in the card room.
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
Then he drove me home.  He tried to put himself away as legit, so I went right into the pitch.
No.
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?
You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet.  You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains.  And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.
I better do some packin'.  I'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow.
He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand, Eddie.  How much cash we got?
Who are you?
You done?
It isn't any better.
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
Hooker!
What do you mean?
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
We were getting 50 from our guy.
Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
What is this?  I got work to do.
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.
Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?
There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked.  And I think it explains everything.  You see, my father was a sexogenarian.
Mind if I look around?
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
Darling, don't cry.  Please.  I know it's terrible.  But isn't it really better this way?
How are you?....  Oh, I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now....  No, she isn't here.  Is it about her father?  Well, can I take the message?
What is it?
Don't.  It's horrible.
I don't believe it! You're lying!
How are you?  Here.  Get under this.
Andy...  this is Nick Charles.  He worked on a case for father.
That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
Your father?
There. 
Why... in the heart.
She fell down.
Don't lie to me.
I know -- I know --
Like all the rest of us.  Has this fellow...  ...has he seen the whole family?
Not at all.
Shrapnel!
What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
That woman!
Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
Well, I've got my alibi.  I was at the Public Library.  Where were you?
Nothing.
Ask him.  I don't know.
Have you got a pistol permit?
You've been there?
Trail him!  Trail who?
Just rolled them up and threw them in.
"D.W.R."  That case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill Wynant... what what was his name?
Could this be him?
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
Shut up.
When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
I said he hadn't written me.
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
You did!
Good morning --
But he's interested!
Have a shot?
She drives me nuts.  She's been ragging me all day.
and there she was lying dead.  The police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there.
I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
That's my business.
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
I can't! I haven't got it!
I wish you'd count them.  There's a thousand dollars there.
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
Thanks, and goodbye.
But what if you need more money?
She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.
What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
It might.
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
You did... where?
That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this.  Ask the police.
Morelli -  You knew Julia.  Was she gypping Wynant?
Why do you say that?
So it's you he was after!
You might have mentioned me first.
Pretty girl.
You got types?
What are you going to do with it?
What are you going to give me?  I hope I don't like it.
You idiot!  Asta! Stop that!  Get down!  Now, stay there.
It's all right.  It just grazed me.
Finished with these?
Hello... send him up.
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
Sit down!
The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.
But Wynant --- ?
This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.
He's just been for a walk.
You dog!
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
Where are you going?
Home?
What's in the other direction?
What's it say?
Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But if we do it, we do it right.  I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
I don't want to see people killed any more than you.  But we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.
Should be easy going from here.  Stay on the pass straight to the dot.
Epps!
It'll be too dark to make our way back now.  Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.
It's a combat action.
No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.
I'm the one's got the big stick.
Wes--
Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
This is stupid.  It's going on a month now.  How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards?  They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?
I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
Now this is war.
Invest it.
Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
They're not going to--
SAY IT!
You're going to be fine.
This.  Whatever it is.
I don't hear any--
Iraqis.  A bunch of them.
Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
They're going to kill us!
What are you doing?
What?
We should head Northeast.
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
We can't just leave him.
What if he's not?
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
Epps?
Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.
I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
We can head back for our lines, and they don't even have to know about the gold.
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
What do we do?
Is that good, or bad?
We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
Well?
Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
Epps?
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
Woods.
Some good ones.
Spanish wasn't hard enough?
What is this?
Jaeger?
You ever think about it?  You ever worry?
That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.
You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
Epps...
Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?
A sinex drop reading of less then 2000 degrees with an accompanying loss of greater then 350 degrees since admission may indicate....?
Hurry up.
Now?
Look, food!
I said what time is it?  How long was I out?
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
They're watching us now.
no...no, no.
It's the end.
That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
Not very encouraging.
I'm sure it's warmer in her than outside, though.  I haven't been out yet, but it usually is...the control is fouled... 
You're in violation.
What are you doing here?  You're not cleared for this area!
I'm leaving.
What?
Oh, That!  I'm 5555 SRT Entron..
What have you done, Cut your hand?
This one has eyes.  Why did they leave your eyes? Could you ever....
That's not it.
She's not there
No...no you're wrong.
I'm sorry.
....I'm taking SP5, but it doesn't seem strong enough.  I have a hard time concentrating.  Please forgive me, I slipped on....
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
Hey, that's the guy-
Where did you get this?
High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.
Now wait just a fucking-
Only once, at Redstone.
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
Right.
Which one's which?
I terrible with mechanical things.
What's up?
Something round, two wires ...
Yeah, another round thing.
What do you think?
Right.
Jesus...
What the hell was that?
You touch me again and--
He is!
Unsolved bombings in the last year... Boston, New York, Philadelphia... but no real match
Vice... Jesus.
You okay?
P.E.T.N ...
Got it! Ace Match Company, Flint, Michigan.
T.J., what're you doing?
Nice to be here.
Captain...
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
What's this?
You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.
Yes.
M'sieu Laval, Madame would like to talk to Mademoiselle Gautier for a moment.
M'sieu Laval, M'sieu Filiba would like very much to see you.
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
<u>Tonsili!</u>
No.
But--
And harems ... ?
Nice day, Major.
No doubt about it--it's that secretary.
You know, I'm not the marrying type. I like to take my fun and leave it.
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
I don't want to see you at all!
You can trust me.
M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles.
And you, M'sieu Giron, seem to be disturbing my examination of <u>this</u> <u>report</u>.
Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
Yes, m'sieu.
That's hotel life. In one room a man loses his wallet  and in another room a man loses-- his head. 
The pepper, too?
Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here!  I don't like this place!
By the way, how is your German?
Now, Lily--
Goodbye--Madame Colet and Company! 
Then you go into the foyer.
Neither do I.  That's where I found it.
Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
Goodbye, M'sieu La-- Oh, yes ... This is a rather delicate matter and I don't want to ... You see, if you read my advertisement carefully, you must have noticed that there was ...
Yes.
Do you know my first name?
Make it out to cash!
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
Madame.
Then riding together.
Good night. 
No--yours, madame.
But incidentally, let me tell you, <u>I</u> don't like <u>you</u>. I don't like you at all!  I wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin <u>your</u> reputation--like that! 
Like that!
Yes, Gaston?
Adolph J. Giron.
Why not? He's a thief--he's a criminal.
Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.
Oh, M'sieu Laval ...
Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something.  Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.
Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  I was a school friend of your husband's ...
You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
About what?
Right!
Yes, madame?
Your bag?
Didn't you take it with you?
Yes, I saw it--but--
How much time?
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
Good luck to you, Rose.
I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.
So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic?  That's great!
Rush her.
I told you you wanted to take this call.
I make my own luck.
We're too late.
My God... Cal. Is it a --
I had hoped you would come to me last night.
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?
How you two doin'?
The boats are all going.
The suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going.
How cold?
Ever been to Wisconsin?
Hello again.
It is that simple.
You liked this woman. You used her several times.
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
Jack, must you go?
Fabrizio said you might be up --
Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?
Are you nervous?
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course.  Isn't that right, sweetie.
Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.
Hope we're not intruding.
Will you pardon me?
We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?
I thought you were one of my friends.
She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful. 
You've got lipstick all over you.
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
Don't rub it in.
Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.
I could see you were pining away--
Who with?
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
Not here--follow me around the shed.
You don't think--?
Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.
A dollar forty.
Not a chance.
Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
My change.
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
About sixteen hundred.
You keep it-- 
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
Come in! 
It's your deal.
How's your mother feeling?
How about you?
Wouldn't bet against her.  Tell you what I will do--bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France.  Not a hundred, though--just fifty.
Don't get yourself all worked up--
Oh, Denby--have you seen Sally around?
I don't know what it is, but I won't use it.  Is she entertaining you?
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Now we get it down to two words--"next month."
That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank.  Where is your wife?
Come on, get up.  That horse is carrying too much of a load.
He's funny--maybe you can use him in the show, Mr. Denby.
Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
Very good, Mary--
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
How much did you lose?
Why don't you leave me alone?
Yes, Yes!
Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got to win that fifty bucks.
Ain't got time.
God damn son of a...
Come on, you...
On three?  You call it.
I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
All right, lunger.  Let's do it.
Doc!  How the hell are you?
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
So tell me, Wyatt.  I'm curious. Do you actually consider youself A married man?  Forsaking all Others?
Satisfied?
Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.
It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative.
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
You really look awful.
You know, we might just pull this off.
What is it?
That was lovely!
Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
Always?
So I assume we're regarding this As just a kind of interlude.
You see that bird at the faro Table?  That's Johnny Tyler.  He Barged in here one day, said he Was takin' over the game, started Slappin' customer, wavin' his Gun around, scarin' off all the High-class play.  Only trade comes In here now's just bummers and Drovers, just the dregs.
Come up to the fire, honey.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
'Least you admit it.
Look, I got a rule.  I don't talk To lawmen.  Dog-catchers neither.
Well what do you think happens When you die?
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
You were right.  It's nothin' like I thought.  I almost wish...
Get down, boy.
I am usin' it, Wyatt.  Been Wonderin' how the hell we got in This tangle.  You know they hit Clum's house, too?  Shot up his wife. His wife.  Who ever heard of That?  Men sneakin' around in the Dark, back-shootin', scarin' Women?  They're bugs, Wyatt.  You Know all your smart talk about Live and let live?  Ain't no live And let live with bugs.
You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair!  Somethin' on your mind?
For a man that don't go heeled You run your mouth kinda reckless.
Talked it over.  We decided we Don't need the money.  Took out 13 Dollars each, though.  Federal Posseman's fee.  That all right?
We should get moving.
Pretty fun too, isn't it?
I couldn't help it, Wyatt.  I Looked at that woman and it was Just like somebody slapping me in The face.  I mean these people're Afraid to even walk down the Street and I'm trying to make Money off it like some kind of God damn vulture.  That's not me, That's somebody I don't even know.
Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted.  You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business...
Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest.
Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?
Virge, you're makin' the arrest. You make contact, I'll back you Up.  Morgan'll back me up, Doc'll Keep an eye out for trouble.  And Keep your hands on your guns. They even look like they're gonna Start something, buffalo 'em. Right over the head.
Getting late.  Guess I'll turn in.
What about all these saloons?
Why wasn't the ship protected?!?! Why was it sailing without radar?
Still, I do miss her. I only wish she could have lived to see all this.
Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
I'm sure she is, James. But I'm afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the rest of your lessons this afternoon.
Wait a minute -
Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?
I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again.
Paris -
His newspapers?
Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?
It was an authorized test. I returned the money.
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
A wedding band??? What am I supposed to be able to do with this?
That's reassuring.
I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife.
I have to get these to London. Do you know this Captain Cheong?
... Does this do anything?
Bourbon. Neat.
Have we met?
I'll keep that in mind.
Why don't we just take these -
Blood or Dutch?
... Yes???
Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
What's your name?
My name is Sidney Winch, and -
And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.
It's a trick! After him.  They're in the south stairwell!
... And there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your Swiss bank account?
Please sir. Please -
What about ID's?
What did your wife get her?
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?
Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.
You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean.
Why does he always pick on me?
I have more sense than to give up everything, my family, you and Sunny. It wasn't me, I mean the real me inside my body. I'm glad it's over. It's like a veil has been lifted.
I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
Who is it?
I was hoping you came to the door instead of him. It gets cold at night.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
What, are you having another party?
Man, put your boxes down and stay as long as you like. We have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out.
You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.
My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to him.
Good evening. It must be all the different time zones I crossed that makes me feel this weary.
Ah, you young folks don't know how it is. How is Gideon today?
I think if anybody had a hand in killing Hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked Emory and Chick.
I don't know if we could take one in with Rhonda and me at home alone at times.
In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog.
I appreciate you lending me a hand. That lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me.
Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives.
What must I do?
Counting the what? What does that have to do with the price of butter?
Where is Skip?
Come on down, guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!
Which one can I open first?
Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
THAT is Sid!
I could have stopped him.
According to my nava-computer, the --
Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!
What happened to you?
Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help.
Woody!  It's the moving van.
Woody?!  What are you doing?
No, no!  Turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
It's not a laser!  It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
Hi!
Ohhh!  You sunk it!
I don't know!
Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  I'm not worried.  You shouldn't be worried.
Who is it this time?
Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!
No!  No, no, no, no!
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.
Hey, Slinky?
Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
Curled up on the landing like love locked out!
Mummy was scared of him, I think. He went to her wedding but he was <i>furious</i>, you can see it in the photograph.
Who's there?
You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been?
'Have ploughed the stormy seas - '
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
I appreciate you coming in so early.
Anna.  What's wrong?  What do you want?
What is he planning on telling them?
Helena --
It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too hard.
Don't bother.
You had it all figured out.  You move into my house.  You raise my kids.  You sleep with my wife.  It was a good plan, Arnie.
You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.
If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
Oh, it is?
God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?
Are you going to?
What's up?
Helena --
We'll get through this, I promise. I'll make it up to you --
Live with your parents?
How are your grades?
You do?  What else you do?
Inhale the smoke and hold it.
You know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day?  He and my mom have cocktail hour every night, from six to seven, set your clock, two bourbons --
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
Are you getting this on tape?
Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?
They're going to walk right past me.
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in the family connection business: real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries. He met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things: entering society and using his fishing boats.
He hired you.  That was a mistake.
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
You first.
Please.  Filing a report will not help you find your car.
This is fucking crazy.  Instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission.  Do you know who Frankie Flowers is?  He's a psycho-cokehead- hitman.  A faggot.  He's killed fucking who knows how many people. You'd need half the force to get close to him.  And you can't get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego.
No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
That's your past.  I want to talk about your future.  Would you be willing to do something for me?
The cocaine brand, 911, is an East Coast brand, a Juarez Cartel brand, and you must know it usually comes through into El Paso?
Sure.  More money in intelligence on their side of the border.  So we have a better idea who we're looking for.  More dogs.  More people. Supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to run the trucks through.  Outside of martial law that's about the best you're gonna do.  But, I should tell you, there are two things that really have us on edge right now.  In the last six months seizures have tripled, even though we're pulling over the same number of cars.  What does that tell you?
I'm looking for my daughter, Caroline. She comes here.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
Can you tell me anything?  Do you have any ideas?
Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction?
What do we do?  Okay.  Fucked-up Bowman's turning blue.  Doctor.  We need a doctor.
What?
I'm sorry.
What?
We'll be half-way down the road with the money.
Do you find that this approach usually works, or, let me guess, you've never tried it before. In fact, you don't normally approach girls, am I right? The truth is that you're a quite, sensitive type but if I'm prepared to take a chance I might just get to know the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don't us girls just love that?
I don't see why not.
Calm down. You're not going to jail.
Can I see you again?
What do you want?
It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.
What happened?
Tommy knew he had the virus, like, but never knew he'd gone full-blown.
Well, Mr. Renton, I see that you attended the Royal Edinburgh College.
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right? That I am.
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
Thank you, Mr. Murphy. We'll let you know.
If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your Giro is fucking finished, right?
Exactly.
It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
You Only Live Twice?
Screenwriter?
You don't know, do you?
All I'm trying to do is help you understand that The Name of the Rose is merely a blip on an otherwise uninterrupted downward trajectory.
That means fuck all. The sympathy vote.
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
Eughh. Sounds horrible.
I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.'  Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?
It was my fucking television.
What?
From time to time, even I have uttered the magic words.
No, I don't think so.
What's on the menu this evening?
Great.
There.
How's it going with Gail?
How long is it?
Where did she come up with that?
Useless motherfucker, that's what she called me. I told her, I'm sorry, but theses things happen. Let's put it behind us.
We go for a walk.
Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
It was not. The Barrier stood between us - but we breached it.
No, no, it's not possible.
Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.
New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
Shuttle en route.
What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
What's going on?
Can we have it quiet?
The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...
Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is non-operational. Captain, we've received important orders from Starlet Command.
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.
Captain, we're receiving the hostage information you requested.
Oh, God
Life is not a dream.
Goodnight, Spock.
I could use a shower.
But he does seem familiar?
When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.
You must allow us to act.
There Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist.
There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room.
...mark two.
What are you doing?
I trust your message was received?
Sha Ka Ree. "The Scource." "Heaven." "Eden." call it "Qui'Tu." To the Romulans, it's "Vorta Vor." The Andorian word is.. unpronounceable. Still, every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang. For us, that place will soon be a reality.
Your vision?
You are mad!
About the ship...
What have I done?
They can't be serious. The ship's in pieces and we've less than a skeleton aboard.
Scotty, dear, he' not a madman.
Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
Spock?
Why not?
I don't understand...
You did break in.
Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close  to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has "invented" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P.?
Want one?
Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running.
Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.
where's your program? Won't it miss you?
I'm your program?
Way to go! We're haulin'!
Yes!
He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
Meanwhile, he might find it.
I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
Dumont... my User has information that could -- could make this a free system again.
How about over there...that empty memory?
Flynn, we've got to help him!
Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it.
Flynn... you can't... I
Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?
What's goin' on?
Damn! Never fails... minute the warranty runs out...
You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old.
Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know, a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User even wrote you...
My quarters.
I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out.  But he acts like he's curing cancer or something.
You bitch.
Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.
Can you cover me for an hour?
Where are you going?
I'm done.
Dana, Mr. Hardy called.  Why weren't you in class today?
There are going to be some changes Dana.  You're going to start following some rules.  And I'm going to be there to see that you do.
Dad, how come you know the words?
I seem to remember something about a history project that's due tomorrow.
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
Immediate roll.  Acquire subject at K Street and Key Bridge.					* Vehicle is red-and-white						* convertible.  You have six minutes.
So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
Probably because it sounds scary.				*
Harry?  HARRY?!
Fourteen, Harry.
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
Station wagon?
He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
Goddamnit, Harry.  This is our butts.  So your life is in the toilet.  So your wife is banging a used car salesman.  Sure it's humiliating.  But be a man here--
Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?
Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?
Do you like my tomb?  The museum				* financing fell out, so I thought				* your clients might be interested.
Hello, Harry.
You think I care about their					* cause?  Or yours?  Not at all.					* See, America is on top now .  .				* .  but so was Rome, once.  All					* civilizations crumble.  One nation succeeding over another. What does it mean in the long run?  The only important thing is to live well.  And...  living					* well takes money.							*
That's fabulous Harry.
Hi honey.  What's going on?					*
Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.
They said you had to run out.
What did happen?
This Simon.  Did you sleep with him?
I think so.
Allison is sick in bed.  I have to go over there, honey.
I don't take those assignments.
What're we talking about here? Pussy, right?
Doesn't matter.  I like change. You know, constant turnover.  As soon as I close the deal, it's one of two more times, then adios.
Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
What does she do?
Sooooo... she's pretty good in bed, then?
Beat it.
Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?
Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.
Worse than Cairo?							*
Tell me what happened?
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
What is it you want me to do?
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days.
Thank you.  You saved my life. What's your name?
Let me speak to Clarence.
You're gonna be on "T.J. Hooker"?
I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-Dongs.
Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.
... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid before, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished, crowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and my dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus appears, and the bus-driver says, "Get her in here.". He forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was from. And, so there you go.
Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
Great movie. Action-packed!
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
No. Not particularly.  How come?
Ask me them again. One by one.
Like it?
Turn-offs?
Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.
Do you get paid a lot?
Four hundred bucks.
You know when you sat behind me?
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
Who and what is a Drexl?
A real live pimp?
Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much longer before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place?
Yes.
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
Where you goin', honey?
Write down Drexl's address.
Was it him or you?
Is this a joke?
I think what you did...
You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK?
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to do most, but couldn't.
All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
Where the fuck is that bitch?
Wannabee nigger...
You comin' to L.A.? When?
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
Is he big league?
What's this acting class guy's name?
In case of what?
Now's a helluva time to play "what if".
Leave the gorillas.
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there.  He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag.
Well, I guess it's about that time.
Don't you?
But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.
Where'd you go?
Why does he trust you?
Wanna count your money?
I really don't know.
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is Vincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man your son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard od us before. Am I correct?
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
I don't believe you.
It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.
Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.  And what you're trying to do is get him off.  Whenever you're ready.
Where'd he come from?
Nicholson and I.
We gotta get him outta there.
I'll keep lover boy here entertained.  You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her suck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's done it before. But I want you as a audience.  Marty, what the fuck are you doin'?
Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.
You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?
Yes.
What was the Jew-boy's name?
Him?  You saw that man?
Women will want to get to know you...
Let's consider again our current information -- if the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on June 28, 1995, that makes us know that...?
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
You don't have a driver's license, James?  Or a Social Security card?
Why not?  Most people have some ID.
You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?
James, where did you grow up?  Was it around here?  Around Baltimore?
Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
You used to call me "James".
You were very upset.  You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.
No, I think it was always you.  It's very strange.
We need gas.
James!  That's a policeman.  Pretend you don't know me.  If he sees you...
The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax?
You... you couldn't have heard me.
I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid.  It was on TV.
Why are we doing this?
I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.
What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.
They hurt you!
Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!
Jo...Jose????
Me?  Are you kiddin?  You're the one! You were a hero, man.  They gave you a pardon!  And whadda you do?  You come back and fuck with your teeth!  Wow!
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
Uh, that message...me?
But you know what's real now?
He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
He was fully sedated!
You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever "developed" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
Can I help you, sir?
But, in particular?
We have a bus to Mexico.  Arrives in two hours.  Have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across the border.
You want to take a look at my car? I think the radiator hose is--
To replace a God damn radiator hose!?
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.
Yeah, but it was shot.
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, hon.  Enjoy your beer, and try to have a nice day.
Lord!  Put the baby in the icebox. Killed the poor thing.
Let me get your change.
There you go, Mrs. McKenna.  Just put it in there.
That wasn't so bad.  What's thirty- some-thousand to rich folks like you?  It didn't hurt a bit.
Jake.  I thought you would be at work, dear.
What's the matter?
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
Thank you, John.
Drove into Sierra?  What for?
Least you can leave.
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
Jake.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
Where's the safe?
Get it, and put the money in it. Pack up anything else you want to take with you.
Sheriff Potter, please.  I can't go to jail.  I wanted no part of it.
It doesn't matter.  He was there and he let it happen.  He can't take us in.
What?
I shot him.
John!  Can you hear me?  Are you still there?
The trunk.  It's locked.
John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.
Husband . . .?
I . . I was helping your wife.  I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
I have half a mind to--
Where you headed?
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.  Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.
Because I think you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
Let's say I do want her dead.  What is it you want?  This morning you weren't a killer.
Twenty-thousand?  I don't have that kind of money.  I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead.  I don't imagine you'll want to be around after poor Grace's demise.  Twenty-thousand; that's more money than I could ever get my hands on.
Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
That's a bit much.
I guess I might as well get this done with.
This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.
Got any requests?
Hey, Mister.  Mister.  I just. . . I just wanted to thank you.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
Toby Tyler, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then . . . and then bust those pieces up, and then . . . and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
Nooo!
Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.
Let me get this straight:  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
Yep.  Tore him up good and spat out little, refined pieces of him. Nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man.
That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick.
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
Christ, I don't believe this!
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
California...
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit.  A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh? Women.
Would you?
What can I do for you, lad?
You meant it.
How much could you get?
...I don't know.  Tell her you had to see her.  Tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. Sweet talk the woman.  A young buck like you must be good at that.  Then ... maybe shift the conversation.  Get her thinking about that jeep of hers.  She loves that thing.  Maybe the only thing she does love. She'll want to take you for a ride.
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter for the juke?
For defending my honor this afternoon.
Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
Look, Harlin, I've got places to be.
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
Great!
How much time?
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
No charge.
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change?
Got any cold soda?
I call the sheriff.
That's right on my way.
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
Thank you, Bobby.
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
A medicine man?
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...
Did you ever?
Is that why you're with him?
I'm guessing no.
I don't know how.
You'd never understand.
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
Where?
In <u>cash</u>?
Are you sure?...  About me, I mean?
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.
I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.
Hope is a four-letter word.
Why's that?
One way, or round trip?
Anybody hurt?
Who was that on the phone?
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
They look nice.
What's the matter?
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.
Toby!  Toby Tucker, leave him alone!
What's that?  ..."concealed" is a definite no no in this town, Ivan. You know anything about Jamilla's grocery store?
Yes?
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
...I think rust.
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
I assumed because of the train.
It's for last week's game.
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
Just give me a minute.
I have to go now.
I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color.
He's kind of a miracle.
I think it's be better if I was alone.
You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears?
What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?
I'm sleeping in my room.
Don't be scared.
You like sports?
You represent someone in Philadelphia?
Where were you sitting on the train?
Did you get up from your seat?
We're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this.  It works the quadriceps.
She's gonna live.  She didn't steal nothin', She didn't touch his poke.
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
Why, if you were to point a pistol at a King or a Queen, sir, I can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied...
I thought... you was an angel.
I didn't mean no offense.  I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.  Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ?
Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English Bob.
This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
All week?
They really got all that money, them whores?
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?
He should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend.
I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house.
I do not like assassins an' men of low character like your friend English Bob... but Bob ain't no coward who will cry to your face an' then...
What?
Who killed him?
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
Yeah, I guess so.
Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'...
He ain't killed.
You're gonna lose your share. If you don't...
Did... you... get... him?
Say, Bill...
Well, that fella today, you shot him alright.
B-b-books.  You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
Naw. Naw, I don't ever go into town for that.  A man like me... A man like me can't get no woman but one he's gonna pay for... an' that ain't right... buyin' flesh.  Claudia, God rest her soul, she wouldn't have wanted me doin' nothin' like that, me bein' a father, an' all. 
Some fucker's shootin' at us.
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'.
Worms was comin' out.
You want the Spencer, Bill? 
I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
Hullo, paw.
Well, this here's Ned Logan... Ned, this here's the Schofield Kid, nephew of Pete Sothow an'...
I was only checkin' it for you. Thought maybe somethin' was bent.
Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass.
You was right to change your mind, Kid.
Jesus.  You done this before?
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
What was the money for?
Who ?
Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people.
Don't give up on me now, Dean.
I know who he is.
Yeah. He said he did jobs for him. Indirect stuff. Always five times more money than the job was worth.
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.
It's a logistical nightmare. Close quarters, no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty.
I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.
We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
Get out.
I was out of line.
I'11 be alright.
No killing?
What-are they speaking?
What if I
with what?
You set up the line-up.
The answer is no.
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.
I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved.
A little of both.
The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.
Weapons. Misdemeanor two.
When does he post bail?
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.
No, no, no, no, no.
And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
I know you liked Keaton I know you think he was a good man.
Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.
You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.
Heartwarming. Really, I feel weepy.
You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.
There was a lawyer. Kobayashi.
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
So this lawyer...
I came clean. I told it like it happened on the boat. So what if I left out how I got there? It's got so many holes in it, the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. So you got what you wanted out of me. Big fucking deal.
That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at.
His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.
But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew.
If he's dead, Verbal - if what you say is true, then it won't matter. It was his idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York, wasn't it? Tell me the truth.
Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there.
Counselor, I will prosecute your client.
What did he find?
I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
This is going to drive the ante up.
They want to settle.    It means a lot of money.
No, actually, she was referred to me.  She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
...to save her and to save the baby.  Is that...
Neurology?
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.
You would not...?
They lied.
I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.'
...apartment.   No, no. Please.  You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
I didn't do too well for you.
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.'  General textbook on the subject.  Is  that correct?
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anaesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.'  Is that what happened to Deborah  Ann Kaye?  She aspirated into her mask?
Yes.
Do you know who her doctors were?
Well, well, when can we meet again. I'd like to get a deposition..
We have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps.  Please don't, don't discuss ...
Thank you ...
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Are you done?
Mr. Galvin's...
Pardon?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
Why?
What Hotel are you staying at?
You want me to tell you it's your fault?  It probably is.  What are you going to do about it?   I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
Is it over?
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
... hey, I don't need your charity ...
You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
So what?
What I'm saying, they're getting some help.
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
Okay.  What do you do when you don't have a witness?
`You guys are a bunch of whores...uh...loyalty...you don't care who gets hurt...you don't have any loyalty...'
She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
...yeah...good...
What the hell are you doing here?
What are you doing in New York...?
We got a mistrial, you know.  Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
... I know.  I went ...
Yes.  Yes, I have.
Who told you that?
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
What did she say?
...they start again three minutes earlier...
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you?
I want you.
Yes.
Something else. My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta. She inherited them. Never wore them, they were too old-fashioned... until now. Now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again.
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
How do you know all these things she doesn't know?
Why did she never tell her daughter?
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
My name is John Ferguson, and --
No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
What do you want to know?
It's a place to live, that's all.
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
No? Then what?
You don't even want to touch me.
The color of your hair...
That's what I had in mind.
I'm scared.
We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
Scottie, please...!
Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?
Love me... keep me safe...
When?
Oh... wandering about.
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
Oh! Yes. Hello.
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
I couldn't mail it; I didn't know your address. But I had a landmark. I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you.
I hope we will, too.
Good-bye.
I don't know.
No, I can't tell you!
There's a name on the gravestone.
What else?
Go on.
Madeleine --
Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
From that music.
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
How's your love life, Midge?
I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.
Could be.
I think I can lick it.
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.
Johnny!
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
I've told you enough.
I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
What I've been doing?
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...
She died.
By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
She'll be out in a moment.
I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
Why?
This is pathetic.
Don't even start.
What are you doing?
Are you sure this was an accident?
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.
Wait. Wait a minute.
How do you figure?
So that's what we're doing.
You got us into this mess.
What is your problem?
Who? What are you talking about?
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
Where's the candy?
I want you to hear me out.
And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
What is it?
Okay. Hi.
Your investment ideas never work out.
He just had two.
He's too drunk.
Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold.
We need padded chairs.
She's all your's Fish. Anything you want. Happy bachelor party.
Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here.
What kind of words?
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
What?
I said, what have we done?
Just do it.
Take care of business.
I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
Whatever you say Kojak.
I don't hate women.
A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me?
This is going to stop right now. Right now!
Stop it!
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
Time out.
Do you love me?
Take care of those chairs.
Just call and let me know that your okay.
Yeah baby. Everything's great.
Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.
What?
What are you talking about?
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
I...Liz...all I ever wanted, was for you to be happy. I just wanted to give you the wedding, the life you always dreamed of...  ...I just love you so much...So much...
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
Just kills me...
Dear God...I don't know how to pray.
Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
I'm thinking about maybe making a move.
The post-Vegas Man.
Fucking desert.
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
Stop this, stop this.
So much the better. We'll all fit. How many floors are there?
How long are you staying?
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
Never.
This evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.
I should like you to do something for me. It's an innocent sort of thing but I'm very set on it.
Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.
Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?
Why don't you speak to her, Ramona? Women are good at that sort of thing. Think of something that will make her stay a few more days.  You are kind, Ramona! Speak to her. I know I don't need to offer you anything, but, if you're successful in this, I'll not forget you or your little girl.
The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.
They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
Me?
It won't take but a minute. It's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor.
My God, what have you done to him!
Ramona! Ramona!
So, Ramona!
If you wake first, wake me up.
She isn't my cousin.
Me, rich? Come on!
I don't want you to untie me. Kill him and then I'll give you the money.
And this chest?
They're varicose veins. It isn't leprosy.
You'll soon find out, you liar!
How do you do, Miss Viridiana!
Yes -- very, very big!
I'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead! You mustn't play under this tree.
In you go! Moncho, lead the way!  You stay here.
Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?
She has the face of an angel. What a pity you can't see her.
What happened to me?
How did you see me?
It was very wellhidden. There was no way to see it until it was too late.
What are they doing in Los Feliz?
What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
I should have told him.
It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter.  Did you find out where the bomb is?
You know how much man power you're talking about?
You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
How does he know who I am?
If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR.
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
My God...
What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
She's some of your finest work, Daryl.
You catching my drift?
You actually listen to all those tapes?
A little less than yesterday.
Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file?
You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?
Give me your wrist.
She's beautiful, you know?
Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
Sounds to me like a welleducated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
I forgot what real coffee tastes like...
What the hell's going on?!
Real effective security...
We know you didn't kill those guards.
How did you find out about the toxin?
That's why I'm asking.
You okay?
What do we do now?
I'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. Is there anyone else you would like to talk to?
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
You can't die until you tell me where the C-4 is. Where is it?!
As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.

THE PRESIDENT, HOLDING THE PHOTOGRAPH
Well, c'n we get him back home?
Whaddaya think?
Is there a press conference today?
But there isn't a B-2 bomber.
It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss.  The Things in Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing.  You get the Actors get up there, and strut and <u>Posture</u>.  But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and Save the Thing. 
"The Country Is At War." 
Well, you could <u>have</u> one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  We're <u>done</u> in 10 days...
Three-o-three...
At the Airport?  Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...
What're you gonna do with Morse Code?
He can't respond to the Allegations.  I don't care <u>how</u> many girlscouts are picketing the ... look, look, look, we're coming home with <u>Gold</u>.  Eh? Tell him to hold firm for <u>two hours</u>... coming home with Gold.

Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  No. Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...
Whattaya gonna do when this is all over?
They should be.  Most valuable animal since Sea Biscuit.  <u>Isn't</u> he...
...what happened...?
Uh huh...why?
We have no home.  We're vagrants.  N'each man's hand's against us.  We killed Old Shoe...  We killed the Schuster...spend our life in a packingcrate...Where are you <u>going</u>...?
What he went through in <u>Albania</u>...
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that, Stanley...
Hold it a minute, Benny, willya?
All part of the Service we Render.
Uh...uh... Mounties.  The Mounties Guard The Border. uh... those Mountie Hats.
We had Davy Crockett hats... They made a fortune.
...the Suitcase Bomb.  ACT ONE Albania denies it. President comes on the air, "Be Calm."  Okay, now: Good.  Now, Alright.  Act <u>TWO</u>...  I need the following here.  Right now:  Johnnie Green, Liz Butsky, and get me the Fad King.
A wider option of what?
Long's you git me back for the beans...
Gordon, the insurance people are balking on the logging trucks...
Fox says Bluestar just hit 23. What do you want him to do?
...if I had your looks, better.
Got a little action there, eh buddy?
I agree. Go thou and sin no more.
I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!
...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
...thanks Natalie.
...this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission, whatever the hell that is, calls and wants to ask me about that stock I bought...
What if he asks where I got the money?
Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?
More money than you ever dreamed, Roger. And the thing is no one gets hurt...how bout a beer?
So what's the problem?
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
My home number's on the back...
Hi sport.
...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.
You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.
The break up value is higher. It's worth 80.
He's right. I had to sell. The key to the game is your capital reserves. You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs.
Money never sleeps pal. When I came in in '69, they traded six hours a day, now the clock don't stop, London's deregulated, the Orient is hungrier than us. Just let the money circle the world, sport, buying and selling, and if you're smart it comes back paying. I just made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold. It's been wired to you -- play with it. You done good, but you gotta keep doing good. I showed you how the game works, now school's out.
Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune!
And I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.
So. See you Friday.
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?
I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen.
Hi.
How you doing Buddy?
You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.
I thought this was an informal meeting. What's he doing here?
Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.
So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love?
You told him about us?
... just got 250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the California pensions. We got close to half a million shares in the bag.
And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.
Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured.
You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the "sir" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline...
He did?
Anybody want another drink?
Weird and tiny huh?
Would you like a closer look?
Yes, I guess you're right
No Jonathan.
She went to a waxwork party
Haven't we been doing our homework.
Well?
Anyone else not coming?
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
Save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain
Besides, Dad would have freaked.
He loves you very much.  He just--
I miss you.
Why is he worried?
She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.
Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.
What?
That's not...It's not like that.
No.
Mrs. Frank?
Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha nonsense.
You look a little old for a student.
Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She wanted to stay close.
You should have heard her play.
And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
She got it.  Turned it down.
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
You're discussing me with your psychic?
Sit down here.
We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
Does Norman know?
Oh God...you knew.
I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse. She was young.  I should have said something right away. But I didn't.
I can't believe this is happening.
I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
Claire, I have to show up for the--
Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
If you have to work...
It's okay if you're not.
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
Wanna fool around?
And we moved out here for the quiet.
I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
Did she say that?
Honey, they're young.  They're probably newlyweds.
Claire...
Norman, you have to look at this!
I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.
Think I may have cracked it.
I think so.  Maybe.
Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
He killed her.
I didn't do that.
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
When?
You're not at the center.
I don't need a shrink.
Sabotage?
I'm sorry...
What?
You don't remember?
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
...I'm positive this time...
I never asked you to quit!
Leave her out of this!
She did it.
Look for antiques...
Do you know it?
She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.
Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!
:What, you're doing Darcy? Since when?
:Would you stop it!
Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now.
You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?  They're reaching out to you, Rowan!
Rowan.
Rowan...
Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
Mum...  Oh Mum, God will surely strike us -
Massive subdural hamatoma.  We have to evacuat it - right now.
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
I know that you're evil.
No!
The portraits, Lasher.  Why are the witches always before a door...? Tell me, Lasher.  Now!
Put - him - down!  His - his heart...
I don't remember you at all-  You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?
My jury's still out on that,
Do they keep everything 'out' ...?
What do you see...?
It's unbelievable that you can do that.
I was born, in New Orleans, too-
Why don't you let at do that...?
Doctor's orders- - -?
Seems more like a year than a month.
C'mon.  Let's go to the ho---
I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
You're a ve-ry bad witch, you know that...?
Fall in New Orleans...  This whole town is waterlogged!  The matches, the wood, my clothes, my skin.
I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -
You could kill me - right now, couldn't you...?  couldn't you...?!  Tell me the truth --- is it Lasher...?  Answer me!!
sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change.  You always do.
On which planet...?
Well, Normie - you won't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time.  How are the hands...?
Rowan Mayfair.
That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that.  Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could -
Sounds good - thank you
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
This must be one of the old keys -
If you want any - there's some left in the kitchen
Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
You are the first person I have ever told any of this to. We are birds of a feather ELLEN...we're in the same league
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
I haven't been using it recently LESLIE
I loved you ELLEN - why did you do this?
Well, what do you think?
Is LESLIE here?
Just put it in my room
You're a novelist - why didn't you tell me?
Dr STECKLER?
ANGEL...
Come on, bro. Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation...
The only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April.  "Hi, my name's Ginger. I love tofu burgers, rainy nights, and riding bareback.  My biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex." Here's a tip:  set it on VIBRATE, honey, and don't be stingy with the lube.  Don't knock it till you tried it.
What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight?
I can't believe that's your mother. We're talking babe-a-licious chub fest, right here in the 501's.
I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?
Hurry.
I get it now. You and me. We're dead.
I feel like I'm entering a forbidden tomb...
I thought I loved her.
We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.
Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
Ted, have you lost your mind?
I have to admit, I am so totally turned on. We should do it. Now.
I mean, what do you think?
We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?
They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear.
I'm Ted, by the way. I think I forgot to say that.
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
You're on the next plane home.
Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. He's what you'd call clinically bummed.
Impressive. This is bigger than our whole house.
That's a crappy thing to say.
I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job.
Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.
She said peanuts, you cretin.
He cared enough to want you to have it.
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
You're amazing.
Come on.
I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise "The Girls of Xenia."
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
They're playing our song.  Dare I ask for this dance?
That's part of growing up, honey.
You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire.
You do like girls, don't you?
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.
The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.
At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...
How soon can we get something?
Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides.  That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.
Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.
No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...
It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
At that point were you able to fight him off?
I want a full-scale investigation.
She bit you?
I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.
You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
Is there some reason why you're here?
Excuse me?
Get off my property.
Is that Sam Lombardo?
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
Hello?
I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me.
I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan.
It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.
You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie.  You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
I had to go look for this coupon.
Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
But she ran away.
You mean this thing?
Jesus, man... You okay?
But I..
Yeah, right.
That was about as grim as it gets.
What?  You're going to drive off without even saying hi?
Sandy... What's up?
No.
Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.
That should put us ahead of the criminals.
Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.
Never seen a gun fire so fast!
Know what this is?
This is good.
Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.
When we find him, he is mine.
Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!
He's not giving up?
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.
You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
You've... done... this... before.
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
I do what I'm told.
You're a fool.  Now put her back.
Sorsha.
Then you get us out of here.
Don't make me angry, Peck.
As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
Hey!  Give me that baby!
Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!
I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
Did she ask about me?
Madmartigan!  I can't stand being in closed-in places.
Dada, what's a daikini?
What do you want!
Kill him!
Ouch!!
What'd you bit me for!!
Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
Tir Asleen.
Raziel!  I transformed them all! I'm a magician!
Time is running out.
Patience, Willow.
I'm not going in there.
She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.
Madmartigan.
I'm getting her out of there!
Ohhh, I hate this.
Talk!  Say something!
Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before?
How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company
Good morning. Book, is it? You are the Yankee they talk about?
Nail it!
I saw him.
Tell you what  I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
Just us.
It's all over, Paul.
You have no right to keep us here.
What was that?
Now what's the problem?
Where are you taking us now?
How long?
Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago.
We had some lemonade and he left.
There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.
You're so sure of that?
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
Anybody know about this?
You'd lie to protect him.
You admit you're lying?
I am not a child.
She say where he is?
No, you listen. Get out!
He'll live.
Get back in there.
Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --
Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.
Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
...have you come back?
Oh --
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
Oh, please give me back my dog!
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
Toto's my dog.
The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?
Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right.  I -- you're -- you're going on a visit.  No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away.
Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
Oh --
...her face is careworn.
Oh --
...paper?
Oh -- 
Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
My...my neck.  My...my neck.  Perfect?  Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.  Go ahead -- bang on it!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
Oh - I'll get it!
And him a brain.
Oh, he's just ascared again.
It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --
It's beautiful, isn't it?  Just like I knew it would be.  He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that!
Yes -- let's run!
Because I'm still scared!
Oh, now I'll never get home!
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
Did I scare you?
Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
Hooray!  I guess that did it!  Help yourself.
It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up!
You stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!
Real courage. That's what we want.
Dorothy next!
Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
Come on -- I've got another idea.
Stop pushing!
You humbug!
Dorothy!
Not even a rhinoceros?
...junk!
To Oz?
Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!
Did you hear that?  He'll announce us at once!  I've as good as got my brain!
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!
No, you don't.
What happened to Len Tashka?
When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner?
What is it?
Is there another way?
Do you know what youre doing?
Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty open the hatch.  It can only be opened for a few seconds or well sink.
Then maybe Id be... open to that.
Elektra?  Running King Industries?  Ive known that girl all her life. Im not sure she knows what shes walking into.
Ive scheduled a medical for you.
007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?
Im well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasnt completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...
Your last chance. Take the money.
The name?
Revenge isnt so hard to fathom. Whats clever is getting someone else to pay for it.
Who is it?
Consider me ungrateful.
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I dont want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  Im not sure he knew that.
Does this look familiar to you?
Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
No!  It will cave in!
What is it?
...what?
It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. Im going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfathers name, the glory of my people.
Know what happens when a man is strangled?
See?  Youre upsetting my customers. What do you want?
Now...where were we?
The Maidens Tower.
No! Bond!
Perhaps this isnt the time...
Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didnt think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if theyre coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.
Weve been pawns in someones game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.
I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
But you knew that I'd -- die.
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
She's with me.
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
. . . What?
I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.
What the hell -- ?
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
Welcome back, Night Owl.
What was he doing?
He saved himself.  He changed the past.
Dan -- what do we do now?
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
Nothing wrong with ketchup.
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
Adrian.
What about you?
Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
Who the hell are you?
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
Come on, Gibbons, you can do better then that.
You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
You do everything Yorgi says?
Come on, don't front like that. You'll put a guy right off you.
Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
That's alright, I'll figure something out.
What's that?
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
Yorgi and Kirill.
Where's he headed?
He's shut out the communication circuit!
What are you doing?
Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.
This is your standard dart gun.
Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation...
I'm having fun, what's the problem?
What...?
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
Nice hops.
I'll leave you two alone to talk.
That's the guy.
Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them.
We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.
You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.
And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
I wish I could go.
Can the Professor repair his own mind?
He's already losing control of his vitals.  Respiratory.  Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid.
Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
Jean... can you?
Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?
What do you say?
He's uptight.
You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?
Come with me and I'll let her live.
Forty-eight hours, old man.  But if you cross me, I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you.
The point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility.  To recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings.
Where are we going?
Don't you knock?
What did she do to me?
I'll find him.
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
Is that so?
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village.  What say you to that?
But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come.
Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
Surprised?
Miss me?
You have your tickets?
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
Ready, darling?
I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.
That's a tough choice.
I suppose you're right.
You mean... the laboratory??
Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?
Oh, at least, sir.  The land alone is worth a small fortune.
What?
My name is pronounced Fron kon steen.
Frederick Frankenstein?
And do you also say Fro dereck?
The wockers with the knockers.
But what you were doing?
Hmm!
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
Cold!  Cold and dead!
Original.
May I see your violin?
Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.
I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.
Look, Doctor!
Did you do it?
All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?
MMMMmmmmm!
Foooooood!
GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!
Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?
Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
Stuart?
How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .
Choose your targets men. That's right Watch those markers. 55
Colonel Durnford... William Vereker. I hear you 've been seeking Officers?
