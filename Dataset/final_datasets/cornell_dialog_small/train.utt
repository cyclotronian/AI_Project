No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
How do you get your hair to look like that?
She's not a...
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
She okay?
It's more
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Where've you been?
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
Why didn't you tell me?
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Oh, God.  It's starting.
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
So -- which Dakota you from?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
That I'm used to.
What makes you think he'll do it?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
Number one.  She hates smokers
He's pretty!
Cameron, I'm a little busy
You makin' any headway?
What's the worst?
Yeah
Hey.
Nope - just came by to chat
You and Verona?
He always look so
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
William - he asked me to meet him here.
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
You hate me don't you?
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
You're not a big talker, are you?
Excuse me?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
Why?
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
I should do this.
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
The duck?
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
You tell me.
That ' s completely adorable!
It wasn't like that.
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?
Which parts?
Tempestuous?
Kat a fan, too?
What plan?
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
In the microwave.
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
I haven't given you much of a life.
Can't you stay with us a little?
My letters of appointment.
Viceroy of the West Indies.
How far from here?
They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
You defend yourself admirably...
You come!  You speak first!
Chief knows.
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...
God... That's in a week!
How did you manage it?
Esdras is a Jew.
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
May I speak freely?
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
How old are you, Senor Colon?
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
But it's...
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
Are you married?
You considered becoming a prostitute?
I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
Are you alright?
You better get packed.
Oh.
Who did cause and origin?
No!  Nothing happened.
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
It was freaky, I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.
No.
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
Nah, I musta missed it.
I don't even watch TV.
My folks are.
I'll let you know what happens.
Two heads.
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
So...who's Nicky?
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
How many victims are up there?
Is it drug related?
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
Stop it.
Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.
No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
You promise?
Okay.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
Sooner or later that's everybody.
Okay.  You ready?
Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?
And what do you do with the bones?
Are you married?
Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go.
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
How much money are you carrying with you?
We are both from Prague.
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
What?
How you erase this?
Whore?
I did.
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
Emil???!
Yes, the money is good.
It's easy to learn.
You've got a call.
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
I know.
New York.
Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
I'll send a cop back for you.
Mouth's clean, too.
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.
This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.

That's right. Well, naturally, I didn't say anything to Payroll. I assumed they'd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque. But it's been almost three weeks now and I'm still being paid as an AGS-18.
Really.
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
How?
Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
Two more.
I guess not.
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
I am prepared to do that anyway.

I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
And your charming little daughter?
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
What do you mean?
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.
That's true.
Roger.
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
You're in a hurry.
What's the matter with my place?
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
You got a name, cop?
You here to write my life story?
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
We eat when I say we eat.
I don't give out the details.
I been waiting a long time for some money.
This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked.
Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther?
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
That was in style a couple years back, man.
Where's luther?
We missed.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
It's your money.  It'll be here in six months when you get out.
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
Doesn't look like it.
I almost forgot.  That pal of yours from the Vice Squad wants you to call him.
A cop...
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
What am I wanted for?
I'm all wet.
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Call me later.
Great place for lunch.
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
Hello.
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
Hard man to live with.
Hey, two days with him is enough.
How ya doin'?
Billy, go ahead, break it...
You sure?
How about some ammo?
How much?
Don't mess with me. How much?
The case..with the stones... Where is it?
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!
You are a monster, Zorg!
She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
What are you doing?
You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.
Leeloo's in trouble?
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
It's a miracle!!!
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
They really made her...
Do you love her?
I don't have time... I need to know.
At least, the cat comes back.
I just found a picture of you.
Hello?
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
Hello?
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
I'm sorry..
...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
What did you say? What did you do?
You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
It's my wife.
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
You hear that?
Uh...
I'm so very sad.
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
Thanks..
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?
They just landed in the desert.
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Drink!
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
Welcome home.
Hello?
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
You should have.
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
Who are you calling?
Snuff?
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
I want to watch you work.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?
You brought the money?
Excellent.
You're a dead man.
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
Celebrity Films.
Yeah, who's this?
Starting to recognize a pattern?
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
How much did he pay you?
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
You got absolute zero.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
Give me the film.
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
Remember me?
I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.
... Hello... ?
His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore.  Definitely not for the squeamish.
You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious.
Who is he?
What's next?
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey.  Asking about you.  I must say you have friends in influential places.
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...
I'm not positive this means anything.
Hello?
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve.
I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.
I didn't mean to...
I had to ask.  I apologize.
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
Rick...I can't.
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.
I'm sure they're around.
I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?
I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
You in a hurry?
You've been up all night?
Then you saw him, too?
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.
I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...
No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
I've been working double shifts.
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
How long have you been awake?
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
Here we are.
Rick, please.
I don't get it.
Nice neighborhood.
Something the matter with the cuisine?
It's okay, babe.  We're with you.
I gotta get out of here.
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
Is that who you're waiting for?
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?
Mommy...?
The tickets.
You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
Dad!
How was the meeting?
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.
What's that got to do with it?
Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
What?
You do good work, Alice.
He sure loves to stay awake.
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
They think I'm nuts.
Poor woman...
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
Bottom line, Alice.  Anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he'll have to go through us first.
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.
You, too?
However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
But <u>they're</u> not Skipper Neilsen's son!  It broke his heart.  Then when some newspapers called Carl 'the honest, sincere son of a war-mongering father' - Captain Neilsen resigned from the Navy.  Oh, he still keeps his hand in - playing around with projects like the 'Lungfish' - but it broke him, all the same.
You've got to let us try, Skipper --
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it....  ...'recharging his batteries'?
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
Swell!
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
Who?
What are you boys up to?
-- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
I plan to. Soon.
This spring.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
You see it?
It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.
Guaranteed, eh?
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
Mmm.
Drafted by the Red Sox.
Don't know about lucky. The guy's a full-blown asshole. Pay's good, though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee a kill, of course. Which I can do. There's some monster bucks hiding out up there.
Like you and Gordon?
Where'd Twombley get shot?
Where'd you get the blood?
Saw him do it?
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
Open the door. We're late.
I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.
Was it funny?
I bet you did lots of bad things.
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
Jesus, why?
Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd you tell her, for Christ sake?
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
Pop?
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
That's illegal, you know.
He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens.
On what you pay me?
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
You? Why?
Want to buy?
The key, Wade.
While you went off for a few beers with your friends? Is that Hettie Rodgers there, with whatzizname?
I still don't understand --
I'm sorry about what I said.
You don't mean that.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
You've been married twice --
Alright. I'll think about it.
You're not using it today?
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
He's asleep. We were up very late.
Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
Rolfe.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
Find them everywhere. 
Which is?
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
Oooooh, I'm good.
How you doing, sweetie?
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.
Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.

Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
There goes your ride.
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
May I speak to you for a moment?
Don't.  I know spin control when I feel it.
How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
You know what?
I don't know why you stayed.
Where are we sending it?
and if that means negotiating...
You wanna knock of f?
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
My god. I think that was a MiG.
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
Elaine.
Ted.
Elaine, what's going on?
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
Are you afraid?
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
I guess this is a first for you.
Simon, what's happening?!
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
Roger.
That's not possible.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.
Whenever your're ready, Captain.
Striker.
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?
Elaine!
Rain.
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
Rats! I've lost number three.
But Ted, you're the only...
See them, Elaine?
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
Airsick?
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
How ya doing, honey?
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
Yes?
Roger.
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
Do you feel all right, sir?
He's not here.  Why ask me?
In there.
Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!
William Harcourt?
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.
Anyway, what's it matter to you if we think it's funny, right?  Whatta you care?
Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?
Get the picture?
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
Back off, George.
Screw you.
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
I believe he is probably lying.
Well, let's roll, George.
George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.
They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network.  And Harcourt--
George, c'mon -- lighten up.  It's a beauty of a case.  Don't sweat it -- we got him by the short hairs. He ain't gonna make any more of the shit.

You think this is the guy who did it?
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
No I.D. on him and -- well, you know, no fingerprints -- so it could be tough.  Your buddies this morning went through the mug book but couldn't make a facial match.
Yeah, Sykes?
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
Could it be intelligent?
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
Ripley...
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
Is she...?
No.  There's no way!
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
They're right under the primary heat exchangers.
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
What's he scanning for?
One of us?
What is it?
What's the question?
Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose.
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure.  They killed him getting it off.
Now many?
What's this?
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
Wait a minute.  We'd know about it.
Hicks, don't let him leave.
Ellen.
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth.
Thanks.
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
Fifteen meters.
Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.
You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago?
Are we going to sleep now?
Can we dream?
Look, I told you...
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
Why not?
Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
The marriage!
What did you think of the music?
What?
No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
Hardly.
You have leave to try.
Why what, sir?
Humiliated?
If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me.
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
Why not?
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
I think you're mad! You're really mad!
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
Stop it now. Stop it. I've brought some friends to meet you. They're next door waiting. Do we have anything to eat? They're all starving.
What's the matter with you?
Yes!
My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?
There's a young girl to see you.
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
Half the receipts! Stanzi!
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
Why not?
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
These are originals?
Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.
What are you doing here?
Where's our friend?
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.
Be careful!
What a charming idea. May I see?
And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.
My pleasure.
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
Why so?
Yes, where?
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
Yes, sir.
Well, what do you have for me today?
Why are you here?
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
You don't have secrets from me.
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
Where does he work?
Opera? Opera!
Yes?
Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?
I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
Leave that alone!
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
Yes.
Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
Mio caro Adone.
How could I not?
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
Herr Sommer.
Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!
Ah. Italian?
With all my heart, Mozart.
Did my work please you?
I have come to commission work from you.
I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
What?
Shall I answer it?
Who?
Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
That's wonderful!
Do you want to rest a bit?
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
I am so ashamed.
What are you doing, Herr Director?
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
No, but I'm the best.
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
So?
Leave me alone.
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
Are they?
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
All Vienna has heard that.
Is it true?
Do you hear me?
Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.
Yes.
Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
What anger?
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
Now you've got to promise me faithfully you'll remain true to me forever. Then you'll see how tenderly your little birdie will love you.
Well, promise then.
This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
Can I be of service, Miss Price?
Go about your duties.
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
And what else?
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
What do you dream about?
My best friend. My very best friend.
Yes, go on.
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
Are you better now?
It's nice to see you.
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
Let me go now, you'll make me late.
Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something!
All right, you two, move along.
Who is this girl?
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
You're talking about the woman I love.
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
Nice looking group.
What about it?
Go on, ask them.
Could be a lot of things.
A coyote.
Shit! David, what is that?
What's the plan?
See anything?
It sounds far away.
You really scared me, you shithead.
If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
Jack, are you really dead?
What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
You look awful.
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
Hot chocolate?
No, thank you.
I don't rightly know, sir.
Oscar, what's the matter?
Where's Matt?
He has?
Whose death?
What's the matter, Charlie?
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
Mr. Dickson in yet?
And tell him not to delay.
Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.
Don't make me laugh, Schultz!
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.
Don't be a fool, Cluett. This is only going to make it worse for you.
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?
Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
Why, Matt!
The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Excuse me
I'm feeling fine this morning.
Shall we let the people come in?
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.
If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
I don't know.
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!
Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.
Yes?
Oh, make that uniform blue.
Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?
Well, I
I already told him I was home.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  Matt, do you realize you're up against something? You're being charged with murder. It's serious, son. Now come on, I know you didn't do it.  But we've got to make them believe it. Come on, tell the truth, where were you last night?
Why pick on him ?
The lobby's half filled now.
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.
Yes, sir.
Absolutely.
He's at a board meeting.
What did you do with it?
The ten dollars.
Yes.
Yes.
Say, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand?
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
Oh, Matt . . .
Did you talk to him?
Did you say Dude Finlay?
Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?
But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .
You're carrying too much money on you, Hank. You better turn some in tonight.
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
Everybody in?
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!
This is healing?
He's smiling.
No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.
This is the best score yet.
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
I ain't done --
Yesterday.
Damn!
Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
How?
'Bout time you got here, buddy.
Ride with me, cousin?
Thanks for the help.
This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.
I got seven thousand.
See, Frank's being smart about this.
It'll be the biggest score yet.
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.
Well?
What the --
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
Another dozen out back.
You 'um big lawman?
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
Frank, don't you have something to say?
That just might work.
You are a charmer.
She's still talking to Jesus.
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
This has been a good year.
What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
You taking sides against me, now, Frank?
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
How much of that story is true?
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
But still died.
Jesse, are you awake?
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
Not if I find the right girl.
I am so sorry, Jesse.
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
Zee.
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
Mmm.
Was it worth it?
That's what I would have done.
The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James? The Jesse James?
I like that.
Jim, you been with a girl yet?
Well, not exactly.
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Really?
Thank you, Miss -- ?
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Well, this land is about to be condemned.
Good.
You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
That.
I want them arrested and hanged!
First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
On a lot of lithium?
You like it there, don't you?
This is Dorsia?
Pull out.
I haven't seen you around here.
Really?
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
Get married. Have a wedding.
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
Are you my two o'clock?
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
Oh? And what should I say?
I'll do it.
Tell him I'm at lunch.
Anywhere you want?
Want a bite?
Jean? What?
Patrick Bateman's office.
Just...say...no!
So, what do you do?
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.
This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
So, what's the topic of discussion?
Oh no, I'm okay.
Well, what's the topic of discussion?
Understandable.  Lime?
Your address?
Nice. Very nice.
Pardon me, but are you okay?
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
Do you feel that way?
Where did Paul hang out?
Don't you know this?
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
Yes.
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
Speak up. Come on.
Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you?
Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork.
You like Huey Lewis and the News?
How can he lie like that? How can he pull that shit?
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
When's Brian coming for the TV?
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
I can't just walk away!
I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.
The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when --
Look at this.
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.
Milo?
Here we go.
...wanna savor this.
Right. Wait. A toast.
That'll be a test, won't it?
Mr. Barton, do you remember me?
You're living here?
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.
When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 --
Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden.
How's it going?
You really wrote this just today?
You've been coming in early.
Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.
That's great! Thanks.
You could've handwritten it.
Gary, I --
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.
Ready for number three?
Longitude 109 --
What?
Just thought his work should go on.
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
Your app kind of blew mine out of the water.
You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?
You calling Phil and Randy?
You know mine.
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you.
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
Why were you snooping in my office?
Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
Oh.
Does he know you know?
So -- how far are we from the campus?
Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa. But that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody.
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
May I wash you?
In Japan, men come first and women come second.
'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food.  It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.'
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
To my health.
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
Yes, well...Agent Kensington will get you set up. She's very dedicated. Perhaps, a little too dedicated.  She's got a bit of a bug up her ass. Good luck, Austin, the world's depending on you.
Be careful.
She's working on another lead right now.
Excuse me?
Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.
Congratulations, Field Agent Kensington!
No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
My wedding tackle.
My meat and two veg.
Have you ever made love to a Chigro?
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
Let's go get him!
We can't just sit here, Austin.
I hate having my picture taken.
Why?
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.
You're smashed, Vanessa.
I can't. You're drunk.
Not a good time to lose one's head.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
Austin, what's your point?
Austin, I'm coming with you.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
Here, have a piece of gum.
Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
Right.
That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?
The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
An evil petting zoo?
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
How's Austin?
Did you ever want to?
You didn't answer my question, Mum.
No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
We don't judge here.
Flower ...
How long have I been here?
Would that I could say the Same.
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
You are female?
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
Doctor Peel, I presume?
Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
No thanks.
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?
I wasn't about to.
Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
What on earth?
For you, Mrs. Peel.
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
That's what we were working on.
This must be the last straw.
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
Where am I?
You followed me.
I'm playing to win.
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
What is it?
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed.
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
Privately owned by ...
We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.
Steed
Amnesia?
Why?
Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.
You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
Mrs. Peel -- ?
I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.
What do you mean?
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
And...
Cole...
I don't want any trouble.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
Great car.
I love that car.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters.
Nice shot.
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
This is it, lady. Last stop.
Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.
I don't believe you.
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
I hope Ilene's all right.
Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.
Your whores never showed up.
That's it, prick lips.
I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
Is that all the coke in the place?
I just want to be alone.
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
What the hell are you doing?
Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
I'd love that.
Mr. Thomerson, I...
How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
Where'd she go?
I think you'll enjoy this table.
How'd it go?
Who was that?
What are you going to do about it?
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
Debbie.
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
That's Franny. She likes firemen.
You know Knowlton pretty well?
-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.
Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.
You gotta let me finish --
-- Stephen, this is bullshit --
It doesn't go like that.
Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?
I like what you've done with the place.
My God, an actual operating 8-track.
What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.
Roll the hose.
Ready?
I saw it.
When dad died, I saw another fire...
I'll handle it.
You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?
Brian.
I work for city hall.
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
I'm close... but I can't get who it is...
Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?
Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
Oh Jesus Christ...
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.
I need another one, sir.
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
Are you still here?
Where are you going?
Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.
That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!
In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?
Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are...  Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.
I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...
So what do you want me to do?
Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.
Four months?
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
Aren't you even curious?
You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
Firehouse.
He just wants to --
We gotta roll, Stevie...
They're waitin' man.
Where's Sean?
I treated you better.
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
-- Burn them.
Inspector.
I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!
Susie's not a virgin anymore.
How come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the Church haven't come up with shit? You got some kinda inside track?
Are you all right, honey?
The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
I forgive you.
Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.
Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
How's the case going?
Get this, man. I was at the game today. Face to fucking face with Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him strikeout. And you know what? He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he laughed and I laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and that he's saving it up for the Big One. Tomorrow. Today I understood for the very first time that --
BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more.
I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
Our first caller is Big Black from Brooklyn.  Go 'head.
What do you do?
Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.
DeLa - what's the matter with you.
I'm out.
You can walk away.  We both can.
Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.
I'm starvin' like Marvin.
Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?
I would like to change your name.
Mantan?
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
Four minutes ago.
I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.
The material you've been creating is too white bread.  White people with black faces.  The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's dead.  We can't go down that road again.
Word!!!
That's a great handle.
Negroes would be in an uproar.
We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one.  What's the setting?
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
Let's get him over to the bed.
He never showed it.
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
You lost me.
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
Hello.
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.
Your life will never be the same.
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's.  I should not have imposed them on you.
So you have your small victory, now what?
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
So they can be on TV.
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
You must think I'm some kind of fool.
Yes he did.
Ahhh!!!  I never heard of that term before.  I thought you were BLACK of African-American.  No?
I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in.
To come back to our roots.
Not her, the one with the little...
...not that time...
...then what about...
I slept too near where I fell out.
Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?
I feel a song a comin' on.
The good stuff.
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
Maybe you need to start.
You leave something out?
Both of us ride home with Best here.
There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might.  But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him.
Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.
Where's the beauty you promised me?
What is the service, sir?
What are the Chevalier's intentions?
You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.
That's a very handsome sword you have there.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.
Who else can give me information about you?
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.
I believe they will deport you.
Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
Why are you shaking?
Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.
Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.
Papa?
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.
Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me.
Can I at least have a drink?
Bill Styles...
Don't you ever point a gun at me!
You framed-him...
We got -- I don't know, we got separated
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
You smoke, Ray?
We're not finished yet --
We don't need the tapes --
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...
He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
He said he worked there --
Back up.
You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
Right?
Why?
His chest was hamburger --
Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first...
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.
Somebody emptied a full clip into him --
Something funny, Levi?
How do you know?
That bad?
Tom, bottom line: I let those kids go out there. If JAG shows up and I don't have any answers for them, my career is finished --
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
Nevertheless --
It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
He's in interrogation?
Baseball?
We're in the middle of a murder case --
You're off to a late start.
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.
I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.
Dunbar.
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
We're fucked, I know --
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
No.
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.
That's not true.
Nah.
Your phone number?
We should tell him we're not going.
They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --
Pike and I got separated --
I remember now, it was before the explosion --
But you didn't see it, right?
Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?
It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --
Dunbar's telling the truth.
Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first --
Tell him to shut up --
Sign here and here.  Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?
Funny. I swear I saw them bring him and the smaller guy in this morning.
So?
You think he did it?
What do you think?
What happens to Dunbar now?
In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.
I have to leave. Tonight.
This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
Or are you too scared?
Fine, you do it.
Bloom!
Will.
Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk. It's one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can't hear them.
Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
Promise me you'll come back.
In so many words, yes.
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.
I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.
What did she say?
You know anyone's who's taken it?
I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
I thought you weren't dying.
Son?
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.
Where are we headed?
I'm sorry.
Oh.
This is it? The whole vault.
How did you know my father?
Were you and my father having an affair?
You need to go.
I talked with your father last night.
Mmm.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
How much time does he have left?
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid?
Yeah it was okay.
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
What? What are you doing?
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
You can see why it's sensitive?
And...
You must have a visa or something...
I...
Put the fucking kettle down.
He wants the money from your bank.
Oh Jesus.
Just leave her alone.
Is that everything?
Today is bath day.
Syevodnya?
So uh...
Oh Jesus.
No.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.
What? I... I wasn't saying...
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
She's alive!! She is not dead?
You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
Okay. Thank you.
How do you want to pay?
Angela?
I need to uh...
Thank you.  Oh. My wife. She had a card here for her migraine pills. She ain't gonna be around no more... So if you...
I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans.
What do you need?
Hi.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
Still need a lift?
Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.
Holy shit.
This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it.
Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it.  These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school...
With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
YOU HAD A PLAN! YOU HAD A GODDAMN LIFE! AND SHE JUST FUCKED THE GUTS OUT OF YOU!
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.
Better than what you give.
My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.
YOU SHUT UP!
Don't... don't say that to me...
Teh... Tehronne?
Take it easy now. Don't rush it.
Gal, you ain't right yet.
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!
My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know why it's best to rotate em like that?
Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  Sting a bit?
I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
What is it?
Get'chu at that table up yonder.
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
How a girl get like that?
It got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good. Got fresh 22's on her. Ain't my doin'. That's just how it came to me. Don't worry. Nobody gonna come lookin' for it. I got the pinks... got no problem.  Ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus.
Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?
Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
Pass them potatoes, Lincoln.
And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.  Who gives this girl in marriage?
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
Hey.
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
Mobile technology is the new fix for these niggaz, I'm tellin' you. I'm just lookin' ahead.  Anyways, ain't no money in drugs no more with these rednecks popping cough pills like they's Skittles. Hey, that's what you need, girl. Get you some cough medicine. What, you sick?
Hey, hey, where you goin'?
He works for Frank Abolofia. Atlantic City.  Casinos.
What's this?
What are they doing now?
Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me?
Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.
This should be it...
This the right place?
What happened?
Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --
She disappeared... shit!
Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick.
It's very small.
Start it.
You did great, Ichiro.
How many men?
Joyce?
What's that for?
You all right?
You can count on the truth from people who don't like you.
She ever pull down her shades?
I need your help, Joyce.
I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense.  I chant.
I still think you're a bastard.
Can't make you change your mind?
Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.
Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers.  The Japanese embassy is very interested.
Check your gun before you leave. They're not allowed in Japan.  It's a nice, safe country.
... Remember, counterfeiting is the Feds.  They'll be all over Abolofia's place.  Stick tight. You I.D. the other plate, he does real time.
Because I want you to tell me.
Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!
You had my help, detective.
-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.
I took Kobo from the street.  I gave him a home, a future... But my ways were too slow for him... I served seven years in prison for my boss when I was a young man.  Kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his Oyabun.  He was supposed to take over this syndicate when I retired.
You trust me?
With these?
Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home.
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
Would you like to be modified?
The facts of life.  I'll be blunt. To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence can't be revised once it's established.
How about breakfast, I was just going to make some.
What about your friend, the man who owns this building?
I want to do it.
Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot.
Next.
How old am I?
Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.
What's that?
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
You're going to be over the limit.
My job is here.
Taffey Lewis?
This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but...
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
Are you for real?
It's a good job.
It's artificial?
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite.
Nobody is freer than when he dreams.  I read that.
When was the last time you cleaned this place?
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
They could clean around the arrangement.
But then how can you...
Have you ever known anybody a long time?
Ten years.
Thanks.
How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?
We're going to have to start the sequence again if you don't stay with me, Deckard.  Concentrate.
What?
Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?
You want to go home?
What about friends?
And you live in this building all by yourself?
What makes you think so?
Oh, now, that's a great one!
Well, that depends...
Let's go talk first, Adam.
Please excuse this interruption.
Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
Do you own a car?
That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.
I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?
See, ya.
You got it! Wait here while I change.
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
I guess we'll need another locker.
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
This is for me.
It didn't used to be that way.
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
Get out!
Never drive again!
He has a computer?
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
I certainly do!
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
No!  Not crazy!
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
I like her.
What have you ordered?
That's ridiculous.
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
I know first aid!
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
My pleasure.
Really?  Okay!
No.
A card?
I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
Oh, boy! A jacket!
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
But, I don't understand.
My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!"  I bet they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?!
It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
What?
Does that work?
How old are you?
What?  What is it?!
Hello.
See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that.
He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.
I'm afraid you've got to.
I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
Calvin?!
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
Get the presents and do the lights.
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
I don't know.
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
Well, what do you think?
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
Go to the bathroom.
What's that mean?
What?
I don't think so.
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
What's wrong?
Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock!  The clothes! The toothpaste!  The guy was on the level!  And you blew it!  A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!
I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.
Jeffrey?
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
Sure I'm alright. 
Thank you. honey.
Do you like the way I feel?
Yes.
Do you like me?
I made it go down the toilet.
Then don't talk about killing.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
Falling.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Do you want to do bad things?  Anything, anything.
Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.
Come on Dorothy.
Dorothy. No!
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
Where are we going, Frank?
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
Yeah?
What?
Would you like a piece of cake?
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Sandy?... Sandy, please.
No.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
Good to see you, son.
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
Now, how are you going to do that?
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
You really want to do this, don't you?
I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.
Brilliant.
That sounds good.
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
What's with Mike?
I'm sorry, I didn't...
You want a Dairy Queen?
You want to tell me about it?
What am I going to do?
Shoot.
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
It's good to see you.
It's okay.
You want to dance?
You want to dance?
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
Look Jeffrey.
Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.
Are ya ready?
Are these me considered armed and dangerous?
Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.
Chest pocket.  Shit!
Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
What are you saying?
I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.
They got nothing.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
You guys?
No ma! No!
Still bickerin' over that, huh?
So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?
Hey Murphy?
Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya?
I have no idea. Maybe someone saw and talked.
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
Nervous?
That was way easier than I thought.
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
Give the guy a shot.
That's the guy that got us off the hook with the "Checkov" thing.
He isn't to be touched.
For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
Yeah?
I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!
Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?
The shooter knew these guys, huh?
No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!
So what are you thinkin' here?
So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.
Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.
These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?
Who the...
How many bodies, Greenly?
Uh.  Shit, I, uh...
But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.
Right now.
Well fuck, you guys could do this every day.
You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.
Yes.
The laws of God are higher than the laws of man.
Forgive me father.
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
Continue the joke.
I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee.
Did you see that?
But he didn't say anything.
Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!
Anthony, give me the fucking gun!
Calm down. Take a deep breath.
Yeah.
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
See if mine are in there.
What about them?
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
Inez, this is --
What the fuck is going on here?
He went back for his brother.
He told you and you let him do it.
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --
I can't believe he just jumped you.
I have an idea for that.
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
We've got sixteen dollars.
When'd you get back?
Who's in the car?
Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
What time did he say to be here?
Dignan. Take it easy.
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
Or I might end up with a broken nose.
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
Do you like Inez?
Uh-huh?
Freeze!
Help me move him.
Wait for Kumar.
You're kidding.
Come on.
You got to be kidding me.
You're living on a sailboat?
Where?
It's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.
Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
Congratulations. You passed the test.
How does that feel?
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
But you're thieves. It's what you are.
Did you ever steal a car before?
Why not?
You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.
Let's not even talk about it.
Yeah.
We think Mr. Henry maybe --
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
Yeah.
Are you a fag?
No.
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
The guy is fucking insane.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
That's my responsibility.
I paid for it.
He doesn't get it. Held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here. It's too dangerous for him.
What are you doing?
This is natural.
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
Way to go, Bob!
What the fuck possessed you?
The weed.
That could be anybody's.
This could be a trap.
Right. It was extremely stupid.
I couldn't hear anything.
Jesus Christ. What the fuck is that?
Is he in?
Is he good?
Why?
What's the story?
He left his sweater.
Where is he? Where is Rob?
Is that your chiquita?
John Mapplethorpe.  How are you. Hi.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
Let's talk about Conklin.
...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
Oh, God... It must have been Bourne.
Sit down.
In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
Sir...
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
No. It's because you don't know how they died.
That's not what happened to your parents.
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.
Because you're afraid!
You still should've moved.
So why didn't you kill me then?
What do you want?
Try again.
She really did that? Told you not to kill me?  I had a woman once. But after a while, what do you talk about? I mean, for us. The work. You can't tell them who you are...
It's just a nightmare.
That's crazy.
...but you're not -- you're not sure...
-- where's left to go? --
You drive.
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
I love you, too.
Say it.
My first job.
No... Jason... please...
What do you want?
Okay, Jason, your move.
Oh, shit...
Looks like he's been detained.
This is everything? Is there.
-- who? -- who else is here? --
Amnesia?
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
What do you think? Is he coming in?
Anything?
Someone dead from this household?
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
Does anyone know his politics?
He won't come.
While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
His legend grows! It will be worse than before!
What is it?!
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
Good day to you, M'Lords.
Stephen ready?
Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.
I have faced him. Have you?
Your father doesn't like me, does he?
Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?
Peace is made is such ways.
Will he show mercy to my country? Will he take back his soldiers, and let us rule ourselves?
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you.
We can't stop!
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
Fine speech. Now what do we do?
Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?
Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness...
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
No dances, just tell me.
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
I... I blacked out.
Please, mom. People will talk.
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
Why do you ask?
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
There must be a way to fix this.
How. Did you. Know that?
You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about "the Lord works in mysterious ways?"
Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe.
This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.
Books?
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
You really think he wanted to kill you?
Oh God... what did we do?
I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
Not if you remember my dad.
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
Are you okay?
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
Because you're... different.
You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.
There's one major hole in your story.
Sure you don't want your wallet?
Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
Where are we going?
I don't get it.
Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?
Smells like sex in here.
You knew the whole time, didn't you?  When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!
Uh, we should be getting to class now.
Destroy it?
Hey, what'd you do that for?
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
Listen to me good, Evan...
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
So you decided to go to America.
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.
Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
I want you to take Miss Lund home.
Here's to you, sir.
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much.
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
I will stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while --
It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.
Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
A franc for your thoughts.
With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.
Please.
I didn't count the days.
Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?
How did you get in?
I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?
Yes.
Hello, Sam.
It's been a long time.
Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.
You are very kind.
Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?
Our faithful friend is still there.
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened.
Ask me?
Yes, Victor, I was.
Rick? Who's he?
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
And I congratulate you.
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
Well, this might come in handy.
Had a close one, eh?
Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --
I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
For the time being.
Good evening, gentlemen.
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.
What is the meaning of that phone call?
The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?
It was a combination of all three.
You know, Rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers.
Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
This is the end of the chase.
I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans?  Rick, have you got these letters of transit?
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --
Make it official, if you like.
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
I would advise you not to interfere.
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
No. Not me, boss.
Boss, let's get out of here.
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.
No.
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
That's death knocking, knocking on your door.  Crazy little woman come knocking, knocking at my front door...
What are you smiling about?  They'll be back.
You can't make it.
Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.
I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They are... You're a gifted artist.  You're into something very powerful.  Primal. Truly.
No.  that was the last one.
Did you really steal a crippled kid's bicycle to make your deliveries, or is that just some bullshit story?
You?  Personally?
My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.
How was Russia?
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
He is a cute thing.
This isn't working out.
That's your dog.
Get back?  From where?
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.
The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
What will you do?
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
When's the next Jumbo?
Which I didn't have.
Need some help?
You're Chuck Noland.
Look, I help take care of the place.  You got my check, didn't you Mom?
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.
Hmmm.  Durango, Colorado; Asheville, North Carolina, then...canceled her account.
How'd it go?
You fucked us over.
I didn't know we had sailboats.
And never take.
Forget it.
I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention.
For the third time.
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
Malaysia's tanking.  We're meeting in ten in operations.
This stinks really bad.
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
That's all there is.
Digital laser readers.
Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.
You want that delivered, we'll deliver it.  That's what we do.
As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
They want to replace me! The Board of Trustees wants to *replace* me!
He'll need clothes... some money...
He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of *course* he wants to "help"! He'd be happy if he could help *commit* me!
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
What'd she die of?
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
I know.
Oh...
And what did she die of, exactly?
What are you so crazy about the movies for?
At least you were never lonely.
But you had so much *responsibility*.
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
How could you not *care* about the movie?
*What* will be okay?
Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
Stop it! Just cut it out!
Please don't make me say it again.
I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?
Wally thinks apples are boring.
I love you, Wally.
I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!
Did you know your mother better?
What's an immigrant?
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring.
They're migrants.
I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer.
But she's your *daughter*...
First pregnancy?
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
It looks like scurvy.
He doesn't like it.  He's a boy, That's why.
I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?
I thought it was my turn.
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him. 
I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me.
Good-bye, Arthur.  Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?
You okay, Rose?
I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'.
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
Do you know him?
They told me I was too old to serve.
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?
You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that.
That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right.
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
Where do you think you're going?
Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.
Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.
Let's just slow down for a second...
Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.
Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today?
Currently, the King Pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses.
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.
Fuck that. We're going too.
Masters of our own destiny.
I'm going home
Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night. They just pulled him out of the East River.
You know what we're doing with the money.
You gotta be kidding me. Her?
You laugh now, but wait until you need a clean place to powder. This is New York city, Sister. Public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda. You know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob? Let's do the list... Hepatitis, influenza, the flesh eating disease --
She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.
So that's it...
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?
Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
Why not?
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
How much?
Listen, Scooter --
Look at you, you skinny prick.
Sorry, I --
Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.
I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.
Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy.  Jake.
Uh... Everything okay?
You told me to change my hair!
We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...
Do you have something to prove?
I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
How do you know I will?
How do you deal with --
Did, uh... Did you kill him?
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.
Jesus... Take it easy.
So there it is. You got that big itch you need to scratch. It's all about the fucking money. What do you want, an apology?
Your mess.
Stop waving that thing around.
Yeah.
I was supposed to meet him for breakfast. He likes that new IHOP they just opened, you know... He likes to order that thing. The Rutti- Tutti-Fresh and Fruity thing they got.
It's bad luck.
Meet me at my place later.
We're working for the King.
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
So this is our boss, right? He chases me and Miles out of his office and he's yelling and screaming, "You're fired! Your whole team's fired!" He starts looking for Lily, Lupus, Gordo --
Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.
Pretty much.
Still time.
The King, huh? Nice going.
Speak.
Like we told you before, we think he's into something with the King Pin --
Do you want to know the first time I had a line on Vig? He sent me a birthday card.  Belated, but it's the thought, right? Oh, this prick's got a sense of humor. But, then again you guys probably know him better than I do. In fact, I've only met the guy once. But now, now I have you. The next best thing. His partners. His "Fix."
Good... I gotta go.  So, what do you have for me?
You trust this Moonan guy?
It's just insurance.
Jack. Do you need a ride?
I hate cheats.
Ouch.
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
Eight-fifty.
Three years, two months. March '93.
All right. As what?
Jack, look, next weekend I'm having a house party. Here...  It's near Oxford. Why don't you come? It'll just be social. No business.  Bring a friend. I've plenty of room.
Last hand.
And your lady?
You're my prisoner.
It came my way. 450 a week.
I had training. In the Republic.
How did it go?
When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep.
I don't like it.
I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?
The door, Jack.
Nothing about you.
No.
For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion. 
I've lived there.
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
Do you believe in astrology?
Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room.
What happened?
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
I didn't.
I'm in trouble.
I know that. But you can now.
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
And I thought you were only after my body.
I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean.
It's all relative.  I need the money too.
Yes.
That bruise has cleared up nicely.
Jani! Where are you?
Detective Inspector Ross.
You've been avoiding me.
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
Where do you live, Jack?
I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.
She's my baby.
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
Does Bella come here?
Hey Jack, join us.
Don't worry, I won't report you!
I can't give you a lift back tonight.
Rough day?
David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John.
I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond.
Where's the magnet?
For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters.
She's not in the gaming business is she?
I just want the job.
Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella.
How do you feel, Jack?
Yeah.
The key!
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
The key, goddamit, the key!
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
You are false data.
The only thing which exists is myself.
This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20. I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
Why don't you have more time?
Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?
And you can only do it once, right?
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
Pinback...
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
New star.  Hey, guess what? I got a new star on the readout.
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.
-- automatic channels open --
Must get lonely being up here so much.
It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
Negative effect.
We're running out of time, sir.
No wire.
I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.
Man, you got a bad attitude.
See what you don't know is you're already in the last two minutes of your life.
Ass like your, I can see why he's worried you'll punk.
Nothing happened between me and Tia.
Move it.
How're ya doin', Max.
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
Out there.
Where'd you clip this?
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
I'll make it worth your while.
Damn... Are you alright?
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
Thank God.
Who is...
How'd you find me?
Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
You got a lotta nerve.
Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
L-Triptophane...a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures.  Then the lightbulb went off.
Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people.
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
Well, not me personally.
What's this?
Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat.  Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.
That was taken nine years ago... I.D.'d as Michael Hanover.  Sentenced to 18 months in the state penn at Rawlins, Wyoming for armed robbery.  He escaped from custody after 4 days.  Hasn't been seen or heard from since.
I'm looking for a lady who works here.
Look, I don't know what you want--
And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
This is not a place you wanna go.
Say the words, "I understand."
You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.
As long as you're okay.
I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
I need a favor... I need you to trace a number for me.
Tell me the truth.  Am I a female fog bank?
Yeah.
You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
Friends don't help other friends cheat.
Only one I can think of.
She's got my word.
Hey, Sketchy--
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.
You rock, Max.  You... Rock...
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
What about this?
Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?
You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. Name?
Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.
We've got to take this slow...
Ann Arbor isn't... that far from Cleveland, right?
So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?
Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere.
What was that D.J.'s name again?
Any luck?
Shit, that dork is Jam.
Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.
I found the Volvo.
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
Dude, this is all I got.
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what?
Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice.
It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
I got...
Jeremiah, what are you doing?
They're not idiots.
I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot.
Okay, you better have something really sinful for me this time, son. My patience is worn to threads and your mom will be here any minute.
Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!
Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass. She's sleeping like a baby stella.
But we took the keys?
Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...
Look, you can have my wallet...
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
Good morning, mongrels!
So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
"The Last Unicorn!" By Samantha Darko.
Why do they call you Frank?
How much longer is this gonna last?
DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night!
So... you just moved here?
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
It's a good thing the school was flooded today.
You're weird.
Where are you going?
I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?
What?
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
Oh, please tell me, Elizabeth, how exactly does one suck a fuck?
Oh, shit!
Who's been giving you weird looks?
Who is Frank?
So, I met a new friend.
His name is Frank.
I think he saved my life.
Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?
And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
How are things going at school?
Can anyone else see him?
A sign from whom?
How does that make you feel?
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
I think now that he might...
How is that possible?
When will this happen?
It's called "The Philosophy of Time Travel".
No I don't.  She worries about you.
How much are they paying you to be here?
I... What can we do?
What?
Excuse me?
Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!
Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.
Where is she?!
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
Oh, Amber...
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent.
Sorry. I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap whore.
Go on! Get out!
C'mere. I love you so much.
So, anyone talk to Janelle?
So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know.
Well, uh, I'm cuttin' out early today to do a little duck huntin'... but, uh, maybe I could call you tonight.
What do you mean, they take out her butt?
We was robbed.
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.
I'm a mirror.
Okay?
Do you think that most people would say that teenage beauty pageants are a good idea?
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire!
...Today's "To Do" list includes a trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits for the "Physical Fitness" number --
Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
Go out and chase that peanut vendor away from the building -- Get rid of him if you have to use violence - if necessary call out the militia and if he isn't looking get me a bag of peanuts.
In case of fire, how long will it take to empty this place?
Eureka Ammunition Company -- Gentlemen -- Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight --  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way --  However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty --  -- and I don't say that to everybody --  Have not received last month's drawing account.  How come?  Your neck is like a swan...  Yours very truly.  Now read it back. 
Yes -- why?
Well - what is he now?
Half watch dog?
I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash -  Look - what do you call your dog?
Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
Wait a minute.  What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?
Send in the next girl. 
Now -- how many men you got in your army?
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?
Not a bad idea.  If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  Now, I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.
With a gun like that you can kill some of your own men.
So! -- He's on your side, too.
It must be done right away.
Are you sure you're not tired?
Excellency, may I present my niece.
When you get through with her feet, you can start on mine.  I haven't been to a chiropodist in two years...  If that's not an insult, I don't know what is.  Gloria, I love you.  I --
Once more! 
Then it's war?
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
What I called you...  Why, what did I call you?
The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war.
Uncle, you can't do this!
This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
And here is one of Frederick's mother.
What do you mean?
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?
I found it.
Our man is sick. Come right away.
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
You've acquired a taste for this?
Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.
Don't we?
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
How are you feeling today?
Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
She's very pretty, your mother.
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had.
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.
Yyess.
Mmmerrick.
Mr. Merrick likes the food here. Don't you John?
Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?
The hospital?
John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
Would you... would you like to see my mother?
Good morning, John.
How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?
...my... home?
My home.
Yes John?
The workhouse.
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
A dressing bag?
HE'S GONE!
So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
It's all right! It isn't happening!
Those things in your hands.
What?
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
You're as bad as my father.
Halfdan the Black.
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
A lot of people like our singing.
No. 
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.
It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...
Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Why?
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
"But" what?
What are you talking about?
What are YOU doing here?
SHUT UP!
It's magic.
Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other.
Thank you VERY much indeed.
A magic dishcloth.
You need to say a bit more than that!
I think we should go...
And you, Sven, aren't you afraid of crossing the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard?
But HOW?
Look, I bagged it last week.
I AM one, Dad!
Hy-Brasil?
You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
You know, my son, our lord said...
And a sort of slightly sick feeling?
Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!
Who's that?
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
Together we stand!
Help!
Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
Made by YOU, Loki!
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
There is nothing we can do...
He drove me mad!
Well I'M certainly not, either.
Yeah.
But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
I'm so excited. Yay!
Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.
Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
Rockville Center.
The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders, right?
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
I don't have one.
I can't remember.
My name's Clementine, by the way.
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
Joel? It's Joel, right?
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.
Where do you live?
I'm not a stalker.
Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.
Frost?
God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.
What do you want to hear?
You just say. I'm not really --
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
Yo ho ho!
I don't think we're ready.
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
What if you hide me?
You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
Yeah.
I'm sure, I said.
I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.
Hi there.
You said...
You mean, like...  Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?
What do we do?
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live...
Cool.
C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.
I knew.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
Listen, did you want to make love?
Have sex. Y'know --
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
What took you so long?
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
I just got in.
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
I might be making a mistake.
I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...
Naomi.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --
Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
So what's going on, Joel?
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
How was it?
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
So you think the dissertation will get published?
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
It's freezing out.
No way. I can handle this.
I really like you, Mary. You know that.
Order me a pastrami for after?
Thanks.
Do you like quotes, Howard?
Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.
That's lovely.
We can't do this.
What, Howard?
You made me have an abortion.
Stan? What's going on?
You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here.
Oh, hi.
The voltage looks fine.
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.
What's your bartlett's?
During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains.
Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.
You don't?
Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.
Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink.
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
Whose fault was that?
Thanks.
Are you in show business?
For magazines?
Hitchhiking?
You're the best?
But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?
Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.
I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
The containment, Second Containment...
But Justin...
Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
What's happening?
What...?
I've got a pulse, he's alive...
What, Justin, what shows you?
What does?
...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive.
I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...
...I don't want to die...!
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
We've got pressure.
That means they didn't abandon ship.
Peters is right, no one's here.
Okay. I'm on the bridge.
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
No one?
It's insane.
If it worked.
You have something, Dr. Weir?
What about it?
It's 2041...
Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't know."
We're leaving.
I told you... She won't let you leave...
Weir is dead.
What are you?
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
What are you trying to say? "If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?"
1500 meters. We're getting too close...
Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit!
Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?
Do we have enough time for a weld?
Captain Miller, you copy?
Smith, get out of there...
We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.
That's an affirmative.
Who?
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?
I'm on my way, Starck.
Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!
BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.
Here's another one. They're all over the place.
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
No. I saw nothing.
Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
What the hell is that?
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
A straight line.
The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious.
He didn't.
About me? How sweet.
Ben, come in.
Ben?
Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
How long was I out?
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
You're hot!
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
Me like-y.
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
Stop it.
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl... the Invisible Girl.
Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
I mean, you broke up with me, right?
There were a lot of variables to consider --
But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
We've got minutes until it hits, not hours... Victor, that storm's deadly -- the radiation's lethal. We need to abort.
Not until Ben is back inside!
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
Please don't make this personal --
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
Go ahead. Just make it quick.
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
I can't do that. But if you wait a minute...
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
Is everything okay at work?
You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?
Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.
Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
Nice to meet you, Stacy.
Do you have any ice tea?
I guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon. Are you going to get one?
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
Did you get her number?
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens.
Hey, Rat.
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
Hey, Mark. Is that you?
I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
Are you Linda Barrett?
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
Are you going to ride that wave?
Suzanne Somers' tits.
My brother is gonna shit.
First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
So what did you do?
Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
Was it great?
I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.
Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'
How long does Doug take?
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
God, he hardly even talks anymore.
It couldn't be.
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
You better save some for me, you swine!
I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
Well, you'll find out next year.
It's very warm out tonight.
Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
I had a really nice time tonight.
I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.
Aren't your parents asleep?
No. That's okay.
I don't know.
...I've got to go home.
What about the notes?
Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around...  But I'll give you a call sometime.
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.
Let's have lunch!
Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying...
They're everywhere. Nobody's safe. And sure as hell not in the South. They like warm weather... You'd never believe it. In L.A. it's out of control. First it was drugs, now it's witchcraft.
I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...
What happened? What did they do to her?
He wanted the pineal gland.
A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.
We're your friends. We're not like the others.
God hell! I think I see the pattern! This one sounds like real trouble! You're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over. As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine. And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts...  This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with you -- and we'll have to arm ourselves.
Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies?
How long do I have?
Why?
I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.
That's what gives me The Fear.
Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!
What tape?
Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?
WELL? What are your plans?
Lucy.
Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. It's terrible.
You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!
Sure. It's all on the Q.T., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line.
What is this?
Extract of pineal!
So do we, lady.
I was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing.
Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
What made you do it? Who paid you off?
The dope ring. You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're here?
Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.
May I see your license.
You realize...
You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap. There's a rest area up ahead. Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours?
Okay. Here's how it is. What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
Oh, and don't bother to make up the room. That way we won't have to risk another of these little incidents, will we?
It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.
You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!
You know where it is?
We'll meet in three hours?
My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?
I don't think you should...
One keg of Beast for the basement, then, truck's dry.
We'll be food, dickheads!
They're right here.
You seem mighty collected about this.
You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
Scared?
That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?
I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it.
Come on!
Push and twist, it's child proof.
What is this?
Oh, no.
What? Really?
Huh?
What?
What's going on between you two?
Is it gassed up?
Four door?
How many?
Max?
I'll go with ya.
They were all over the place.
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
What's wrong?
Let's go.
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
Here, take a few of these. Studio makes 'em in the basement. They keep the fat off.
And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures.
Excuse me, sir?
I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --
Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can't break me. I'm back, and I'm gonna make the best of it.
Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes.
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
You're afraid!
Okay, but come here first.
...Not only an artist, but an instrument of change. We must look to the world around us, not content to observe, but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs. We will not stand idly by as Fascist bombs obliterate democracy. We contribute our profits, for if fascism is not stopped in Spain, it will spread across Europe, jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive.  The artist, to be vital, must be a soldier too.
You don't think I'm good enough?
What does Clifford say?
There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?
No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
Harry!
We're all square now, Harry. Right?
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
Were you a drug addict?
Thank you, Ralph.
An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
It's already started, Dad... with me.
What do I do, Dad?
...So what do you think?
Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and... 
But, Kurt, I...
I'm really sad it's closing. Now what am I gonna do on Tuesday nights?
Why?
Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
What?
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
Well? What'd you think?
How'd I look?
Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.
What?
I kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, I would have been miserable living his life.
You don't know what you want.
Is that why you did it?
You're telling me.
You know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie. I mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. And all my friends, I know they're going to smile and say they loved it.
Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything.
Don't start, Farmer.
How the hell do you find me anyway?
I'll bet.
I should've known...
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
You know something, Harry?
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
Frances, it's me, Harry?
I love you, Harry. I love you.
Been a lot of years, you know. A long time waiting. For what? End up feeling like a sap.
Right. Except... time has a way of --
How... how ya doin', Farmer?
It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
Very slow.  But we're not going to stop, are we?
That would be okay.
And no people.
Shit!
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
And what's the title of this seduc... assault?
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
But they're using you!
It's okay.
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
How long will you be?
I'm back, Mama.
Don't... talk crazy.
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
Huh?
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
And he drove me to mine.
I'm glad you finally came to the door. A man shouldn't have to scurry in the shadows.
Why?
Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
What is this?
You dance so beautifully together.
Must've been a terrible row.
Are you all right?
Are you sure it can't hurt us?
God took her from us.
Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held!
Smell the air. Wonderful.
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
I wish to be your wife.
Our decision. Together.
I've no choice
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
Brother and sister no more.
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
Professor?
Now you've got him started.
Only you would think of that!
Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
You're making a scene!
Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
Philosophical?
Professor Waldman.
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
Electricity.
We are kindred, you and I. Men of ambition. Let me tell you all that I have lost in such pursuits. I pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man.
It's just this place. The storm. That's why you're all upset.
Any particular reason?
I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten. If you're still up, we can talk, okay?
You think you're gonna last all summer?
Oh, my God...
It still hurts?
Trouble?
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
Help you clean up?
What's the matter with it?
You said we were special.
You know what I said, though.
I wouldn't know.
This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
Chance to get even?
Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?
Holy shit...
Are you wet?
Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.
It's beautiful...
Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.
You said it was just you and your son.
You like the car?
What's this guy's problem?
What about Kate?
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
Who's this?
Where is the little lady?
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
You're a preacher?
Why'd ya quit?
Then?
Who else?
Why not, against your religion?
What are you going to do?
You too, preacher?
I don't know about that. In order for it to have any power, I think it's gotta be an official crucifix.
You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!
I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
What did I say?
I'm sorry.
See ya.
Hot goddamn day!
Not even for lunch?
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
Start the car.
Do they have a waterbed?
I got both rooms on either side of us, so we don't gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How's that feel? You okay?
Hey, when you talk to him, see if you can arrange a better deal than thirty percent.
Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?
No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
This isn't gonna work.
What does that mean?
I'm lookin' scared?
Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
How are you?
In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
Oh, really.
Did you just have a brain-fart?
See me, sir?
Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
Shit.  Think we're had.
Hardly the case, Senator.
You know him.
You'll think about my offer?
Then I suggest we start there.
Montgomery, why do they call you "Flea"?
Close as I can get, el-tee!
Six o'clock!  Marking, marking!
Just do it, okay?
She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
Thank you, sir.  But I like these just fine.
I'll try anyway, sir.
The Navy Cross...
Unless you Whiskey Run.
Probably hear back from CNN first.
I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --
That bad?
So why are you telling me this?
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
I'd sure like to know who.
It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway.
Made it to Week 10 last time.
Hey.  Way to gut it out.
Wick.  They got your crew, too?
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
What're you guys doing?  Huh?
She part of the training?
Permission to get dressed, sir?
Simple question, lieutenant.  No reason not to answer.  What is your father's name?
Any brothers?  Sisters?
Would you have shot if it was a man?
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
Clear.
The White House.  If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well, it's been said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man.
This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.
Who the hell are all these people?
That why you dumped him?
Yeah. Why are you asking?
My God. He's going after the nest.
Don't you think we have enough?
You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.
You're still mad at me, aren't you?
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
...he's pregnant.
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
What are you doing here?
Come on, the broadcast booth is right over here.
You'd be surprised.
And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.
Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
Your old sweetheart?
Wish me luck!
Can I use some?
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
And how should we do that, Sir?
Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.
Somebody must have seen it.
The radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue. This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur.
We think there's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area.
General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park...  We should be able to take him down.
I need you to trust me.
It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
Here. 23rd street subway station. Where we first found the fish. With a little luck, this will lead us right to it.
They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner.
Three eggs. I thought there would be more.
Who the hell are you?
Hello?
This is it?
Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible...
Sir, it's you  Thank Ipthar!
I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
You WILL go out there.
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
There it is. The Beryllium sphere.
Go ahead!
It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
He's a twit!
Settle down, Alex...
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
And note the sucked in gut.
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
May I get the check?
I don't know.
He dissed us AGAIN, Brandon!
Oh.  Okay.
Commander, as I was saying... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?
Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
Okay, now left at the next turn... Past the oxygen units.  Make a right there. Then go through the antimatter vent...
No, wait, are you-
I just can't believe it. Any of it!  Look at this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven.  Oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  Computer?
Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
No, I'll kill you. .
How do you remember this stuff?
Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
Your last name.
It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
I know...  You contruct a weapon.  Look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?...
We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?
We're alive!
It's Jason...
But I'm the Commander!
Hey... Hey where are you going?
There's nobody here. Jason...
We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Self control?  That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!...
All right... here's the plan:  First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere.  Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter.
Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!
Oh my god! Tommy! Stop the pod! Stop the pod!
Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.
Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me!
We.. We lie.
An interstellar vox.
Weapons storage...
Then how did he find out about the device?
Former Commander?
A thousand apologies. We have failed you.
Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
You said we do appearances together, or not at all.'
Well, it's... This was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  We don't know what it does either.
Do your best, Tommy...
Sorry Guys... It just went off.
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
NO NO NO.
enerao, I've host them. The maanetlsm o: the field Is disrupting our onstru- ~ait. There they are
Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?
We've got to attack the British! Now!  Have they put you in charge yet?  Do we have an army yet?  What is happening?
What's your frank estimation of the British?
Ben Franklin's going to Paris, but I think the French will be long on talk and short on guns.  Our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment... could they beat the British?
The army needs you.
They're ready.  Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything.  Of course, we get nothing from Congress.  They need boots, coats... we desperately need food.
That scum Joseph Reed... they're calling him the 'King of Pennsylvania'.  The man's a budding Cromwell.  He condemns rich Tories to death and then 'appropriates' their property for himself. Naturally, the pig hates me for every Tory I've saved.
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
Wil, I want to remind you of a conversation we started just before Monmouth...
What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
I am to take command of Major General Lafayette's division and lead the attack.
How old are you, Captain?
Are you going to keep him, sir?
What is this?
George, remember that night when we were drinking with Arnold?
What's your advice, Alexander?
Horatio!  Horatio Gates, of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation.
The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill.  With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.
Who the hell knows?  Everyone's giving orders.  It's all very democratic.
With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.
They are... friends of Congress.
Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
Unofficially, General Greene.
No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
Gentlemen, let me get to the point, I can't see the wisdom of pursuing this old court-martial against General Arnold.
Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!
Sir, please accept my commission from Congress... and...  You must see this portrait of my beautiful wife, Adrienne, we had the most perfect little baby girl just before I left.  Her name is Henriette...
These supplies...?
Well, we will accept these charming little gifts.  When we see them. Meanwhile, please, take your pick of a horse.
My God!  Who ordered this retreat?!
Our beloved father, the King, also refuses to bend.
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
"Liberty, Virtue, Country"... That's from Cato... you know, that play about the noble Romans?  As I was riding up to Philadelphia, I found myself thinking about the old days...
Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending!
Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws.  One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding, it would be legally impossible to distinguish them.
I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
If the constitution is ratified... we'll have a country.  They'll want to elect you president of the convention, which means president of the country.
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
So, you are William's wild young neighbor?  Or should I say, 'brother'; William claims you as a member of his family.  I have heard so many unflattering tales about you, and I understand, that except for you, this 'family' is quite cultivated.
Where... do those men come from, George?
Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?
I always though London was the place to be:  capital of the world, the most spectacular city on earth.
Is it?  Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.
What are you doing?
All people have rights!
William, we've been studying hard, I really know my stuff.
His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
I heard in the Federal joints they let you spend an extra five minutes at the glass with your Daddy on Father's Day.
What about him?
You get life for kidnapping.
And that's for the airport.
He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?
He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
Title's the first thing's got to go. And the guy's name. I mean, even this writer's name, Murray Saffrin is better than "Lovejoy".
There's Ilona.
Get something going there.
You know how to write one of these?
That's all there is to it, huh?
I can't believe the way you guys do business out here. I can't believe how fucked up your organization is.
You know Laurel Canyon?
She's great. Gimme the money.
Listen, Harry, how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand? You pay me back at your convenience, no interest.
C-18.
I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man?
Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
You say look at you?
Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before - I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was - forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right?
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.
Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?
Operator, how do I get Las Vegas Information?
A marker's like a check, Harry.
For a movie?
Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it.
Just a thought.
You don't even know these guys.
What do you get out of this?
What?
Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
You cut straight hair in this place, or just fags?
So you want to know.
No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it.
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
I got you a copy of the script.
I don't want to act in it, I want to produce it with Harry. Especially if I help him get Martin.
How'd you meet Martin anyway?
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
Yeah?
Harry... My God...
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?
No, I said I'm never goin' to bed. There's a difference. See, the article says most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe.
He already knew it.
Whatta you doing out there?
Yeah, but whose point of view?
What a spectacular view.
I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
How did you get in the house?
That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.
Harry, we spoke with Martin.
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
Karen. Wow. Look at you...
Oh, for Christ's sake -
A passenger liner, north island. Over.
Roger, North Island. Please advise pending further information. Over.
Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.
Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.
Fucker!
One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire.
Probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current.
Ready?
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
Light in those passages ain't so good.
Did you?
You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?
What about running number two by itself?
You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks?
If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options.
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
Dodge to Murphy.
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
What the fuck -- ?
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.
Don't fall asleep.
Coffee.
You okay?
What?
She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.
Why not call for help?
What guy?
So, we find this guy and make a deal with him.
They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
What, like some kind of ghost?
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
What do we do with him?
Over the gold.
What?
I must be in the wrong business.
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.
Yeah.
Too deep to anchor out there.
Call the Coastguard?
Whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned. We've got every right to salvage her.
If they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off.
So what? We gonna unload the gold and get a move on?
I heard that.
What now?
Greek citizen. Merchant navy.  Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did.
Oh, man.
We're still drifting.
Can't find the shotgun.
What about the gold?
What's this?
You're kidding, right?
Will you get off my back for once?
Maxine.
What?
About what?
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
That was great - jeez, thanks again for cooking all this.
What are you trying to say?
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
Hmm.
...wow...
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
It's not optional!
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
Do you want something to drink?
Nothing.
You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
Yeah, well --
Why not?
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
Since when is she an "actress"?
Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?
You can have that one.
Jesus! Listen to this one: "Do you remember me? Airport shuttle, June 7th. You: striking redhead with yellow dress, pearl necklace, brown shoes. I was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens. Am I crazy, or did we have a moment?"
Does Oomie really like this show?
What are you talking about -- who?
God, I think Josh is too mature for us.
Look, maybe that's him!
SHUT UP!
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
It's obviously him!
What's going on now? What's he doing?
Are you sure?
Ew, look at this...
What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"?
We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking.
There he is...
It's a surprise.
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
That rules!
Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job...
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
How repulsive!
What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
Hello?
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
Oh, how "punk."
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
That's five hundred dollars.
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
Do you have any old Indian records?
Wow!
Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!
No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.
What about her? Would you go out with her?
Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?
C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?
We need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests.
Yeah, sure... very funny....
I - I'd really rather not...
Yes, that would certainly do...
What did you tell that girl?
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some --
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
What, are you a klansman or something?
So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?
Hey, can I borrow this?
Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
Uh... hello?
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
No, of course not.
...What do you mean?
What are you doing here?
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
Yeah, sure. Of course.
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
God, Dana's going to kill you!
So what's the story with the two cheerleaders over here?
I agree.
Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
No... they said she was here...
Why would she be hiding from me?
Maybe she's with Josh?
I don't know.
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
I have no idea - I just want to...
Did she say that?
I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.
It doesn't pay very much, but I should be able to afford my own place in a few months... Do you think that's too soon? I'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage...
I wasn't and you know it and don't push it- just listen- we have a problem in Tsavo-
Starting now, we attack them.
-build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can you do that?
I do need to see Starling.
It's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble-
I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.
Understand, I had help-
I'm David Hawthorne, this is my hospital. And my advice to you is, "don't get sick in front of it."  That was meant to be charming, sorry. I seem to have lost the knack.
All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
With much more on the way-  -John- we could have had this chat on flatter ground-
How lucky we are.
Second death? Where?-
Have you got it?
...misfire... it jammed...
Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water?  They're only lions, yes?
I'll have to.
Why do the workers look unhappy?
I am also liaison between these two.
Oh yes, I think so. 
Afraid of lions.
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
Why so many?
My life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder. Our lives have crossed because two lions went mad. But what if in the future the three of us do something grand for humanity? Was that worth all the lives? Too soon to tell.
We'll do the happiness index next.  I'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
You're also a human being, Frank.
He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.
What do you think?
His name is Oscar.
I'll do it.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
So this is what you do, huh?
You're really good, you know.
I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
Hi, Ray.  It's good to see you.  Thanks for coming.
I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street.
Have you made any plans yet?  You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
It's a painting I'm restoring for the new Byzantine exhibition.  It's a self-portrait of Prince Vigo, the Carpathian.  He ruled most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th Century.
I command you.
The season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  Bring me the child that I might live again.
Your honor, may I approach the bench?
That's it?  That's all you have to say?
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
I fixed you up with Diane Troxler and she put out, didn't she?
Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.
I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman.  Why were you digging the hole?  And please remember that you're under oath.
So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
You were supposed to help me with this.
"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"
You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.  Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.
Who was that?
Nothing.  Not a trace.
Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
Rivers of the stuff!
Who?  Who?  Who?
Well, Holmes, what do you think?
You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
And he didn't die of old age either.  He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
Are you all right?
Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?
You better watch your mouth, man, or I'll punch your lights out.
She's moving!
And pure --
Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
That's too bad.
I think I should spend the night here.
Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
But why?  The students love us!
You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too.
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.
Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
Mr. Mayor, it's a pretty simple choice. You can believe Mr. Pecker here ...
Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
Don't cross the beams.
Where's the Keymaster?
What now?
Sorry, Buddy!
Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?
What do you mean by "seen?"
Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
But most people are afraid to even report these things.
It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.
Who was the architect?
You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.
I should at least have you, don't you think?
No one in Rome has ever heard of him.  Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have?  The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  Forget about him.
For the gods, spit it out!
Kill him!  Tribuus -- execute that bastard.
Where have you been?
What is that... wailing?
Now that is a happy sound! Tomorrow, I want the citizens -- my people -- back in the arena.  The Gods know, I'm tired.  Come to bed, now; tonight we're celebrating.
Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience?
You and my father have become very close.  Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.
Endorse me in public.  Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates.  I know you would give anything to be outside again.  Endorse me and you will be free.  Think of it.  What would you do with your freedom?
So am I.
This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in power.
Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed?
AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
I've read of it.
My loyalties... were in doubt.
Is this Rome?  Are we just going to be executed?
I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.
To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman.  Read to sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night.  My beautiful daughters.
Where are they?
I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
Servis made it through again?
A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
The Senators admire you.
They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
I made the plume from a quail feather.
Don't stop to visit -- take the children straight home and I'll follow as soon as I can.
Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!
I want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to want that. It's just that Marcus trusts me.
Who the hell are you?
General, do you realize what happened out there today?
At the end of the day I was approached by the Golden Pompeii Olive Oil company.  Small, but profitable.  They asked if you would endorse their oil.  We could get some very nice posters.  Make some very big money...
General, hang on... drink slowly. You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician and a Divine of Janus with you tonight.  A fan sent them to you.
You put this inside your shirt -- when Tiger stabs your stomach -- it's full of pig's blood.  Gushes out everywhere!  It's really impressive.  Fantastic!  Better than the real thing!
You get to come alive again in the country!
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
Could you do it?
What?
We won't. Let's go inside.
Where we going?
I'm sorry. That is not my business.
Was she married or something?
All right.
Okay.
What's the matter?
Why aren't you ready?
Don't cry. 
Where are you meeting this person?
Yes.
-- really incredible --
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
What are you looking for?
Don't you have it on?
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.
I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
You won't?
You really will?
We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
I just don't think it would work.
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
Exactly how do you mean?
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
Well here's the purse.
Where are you?
Where are you?
Did you get a room?
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
Is there an ashtray in here?
Is it a girl?
Whatever it is you're upset about.
All right then.
Did you know that?
Sit down, Benjamin.
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
No.
I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
Thank you.
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
But they would! Don't you see?
Do you understand what I said?
Have you gotten us a room yet?
Do you want to?
Do you want to get it now?
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
Well -- goodbye then --
Yes?
Will you bring me a hanger?
You what?
On your first time --
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
There isn't any.
We're talking.
We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
And you were a student also.
I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?
Don't talk about Elaine.
I wish you'd tell me.
What?
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
What are you doing?
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
I don't believe you.
You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.
I say I've got it.
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
I drive around.
Why did you say that?
You believe me, don't you?
Well -- when did you decide all this?
When did you two talk this over?
Well --
How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
I drove -- I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I -- I drove her home.
Here. It looks like you need a refill.
What?
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
Thank you very much, sir.
What?
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
Hello.
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
You miss the point.
Yes?
Can you see me now?
-- before he does --  You're disappointing them, Ben. You're disappointing them.
Is anything wrong?
I want to speak --
How?
He must be very nice.
Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --
Too bad.
Yellow Room where they dance -- 
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
I'll do anything for you.
Oh!
And then --?
I see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it... And what is your pleasure now?
The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping. We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet, in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest, no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous is alone... But why should I be telling you this? Last night I did not know you at all -- who are you, really? -- I do not even know your name.
And what do you do -- now?
Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
That's a silly joke.
There.
I'll not denounce you.
So --
You do believe that I really love you?
You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.
Then you know him?
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
The Baron is tired?
Is that too much, Baron?
That was my last.
I take five hundred.
Well -- last night was not so good.
It's always so quiet here.
My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
Hello! Hello! --
For me?
I don't know.
Telegrams?
You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?
Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Oh, I've got to find it.
You've nothing to fear, Kringelein
I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes.
You must look at my face and not at the floor.
You're trembling.
Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.
You loved the Baron, didn't you?
Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
Moreover --
Moreover...
Skiing? 
Not too quickly.
You're a little too fast.
Miss Flaemm.
I'm going to keep an eye on that Kringelein fellow. I'll find out where he gets the money to hang around the Grand Hotel.
Yes.
I must go to England -- at once.
You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --
Insolent young cub!
Baron!
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
And ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down.
What?
No water -- What a place!
Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious...
Sorry, Preysing. 
How clear is Manchester?
You're a deep one.
Let us cancel the engagement.
Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.
Good morning, Suzette.
Madam has slept well?
Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train.
Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going.
He will be on the train.
Mr. Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. It is large and on the front with bath.
Certainly, sir.
Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
Who are you? -- An embezzler most likely.
You're discharged.
Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
I know -- I know.
Next week.
What you need is some relaxation.
What do you want with her?
Hi, Bobo.
How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
Your what?
No.
You ever hear about the oranges?
He's a good kid. A salesman.
You're a thousand percent right!
Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
And I'll want to leave an early wake-up call.
Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.
Well, you've got your information ahead of New York, I see that.
The ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.
Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
Sounds like a good Idea.
Oh, come on, Roy.
Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years?
Don't mention it.
What happened to your hand?
I like those.
You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.
Lucky? You call that lucky?
I tripped over a chair.
No.
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was.
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage?
Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do, throw me off my game?
Her job.
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?
No.
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
Working the what?
The tap. What you do for a living.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.
He retired.
You mean, it would be too tough to give me a turndown here. Easier on home grounds.
I don't think I need it.
That's what I say.
What I say is, no. We don't do partners.
That's natural.
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
What?
Ate the gun. Oh.
Well, thank you. And thank them.
Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush.
No thanks, I'm not thirsty.
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
Well, when you put it that way.
Carter.
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
Carter.
Funny, we just drove right in.
Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no."
I promise not to run off to Cancun.
Alright, I was wrong.  There is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster.
It's an option.
Oh, so now it's my fault?
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
I'm not leaving without her.
Not me.
What are you doing here?!
Better?
Still wants to move out?
The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
You just dropped a shitload on him... give him some time to digest it.
So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
Look, they're staring right at us.
You're so easy...
Mom -- Who is this?
Is Tim there?
Whatever happened to women in back?
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
Aren't you gonna answer that?
Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
You've been watching too much TV.
He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!
He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
Where are you going?
Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
What now?!
It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well.
Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on our way.  I want the entire staff on alert.  We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours.  If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back.
What is that?
Sam, don't -- let them take care of her.
There's more people moving eastbound down Old Reservoir Road past the elementary school.
Where's the child?
You've created a monster.
What do you know about Michael?
Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
Who else knew I had the baby?!
Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
Um.
I suppose.
How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
At least we found the diamonds.
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
How short the skirts are.
You know what gets me?  Those guys who went to the moon!  To the moon, boy!
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."
Is Penelope in?
I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa.
I wouldn't drop my gun.
No matter what you say to me, I still think you're the greatest guy I ever knew.
Hello.
And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where?
Man and boy.
It makes life spicy.
No.
Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting."
As in "Death, where is thy sting?" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more.
Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia.
We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name!
Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes."
Dad--
I'm a man.
No.
Dad?
Get mad!  Tell me you don't like the way I treat your mother!  Tell me you wish I'd never come home!
Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?
I'm engaged.
Some kind of animal?
You were well adjusted to my being dead?
Disease?
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!
He hasn't had breakfast yet.
I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.
Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
It couldn't!
Such as?...
Tell me about its sexual roots.
I like the truth.  I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.
And no one's there now?
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
Well--what have we here?  A family.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's a failing, I know.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
You're begging him to kill you?
So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
Honor, I suppose.
I'm going to call the police.
All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
Ooops.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.
I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here.  You can come back later.
We have, have we?
It died for your sins.
There's a certain amount of information there.
You're a filthy, rotten bastard.
You're old--so old.
No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
Cut me open.  Find out.
I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
You're too modest.
Thank you--for my life.
Alice got married again.
Won't you please join our club? Please?
She's my date tonight.  What do you want her to do--bring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump?  Bugger off!  Ask Paul what he thinks.  Your mother looks beautiful--right?  Kid?  Doesn't your mother look nice?  Paul?
Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.
No.
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
I know.
Oh, Paul--
He's a ghost!
That's an interesting piece of news.
Then who flushed the toilet?
What?
What are his symptoms?
My father!
I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.
Coming.
What then?
It's true.
We made the date three months ago.
"War is not healthy for children and other living things." How lovely.
Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
That's been said before.
You fool, you fool.
Is that a fact?
The late Mrs. Harold Ryan.
Kid--kid--
Minors aren't allowed at fights.
"Happy Birthday, Wanda June!"
Hello. My name is Beatrice. Have you been here before?
No. I don't think so.
I just want to ask some questions.
You're still dressed?
That's cool.
'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
Man, how many girls do you need?
Are you still going with that fella that teaches at Grand Valley?
Yeah.
Kristen went on that convention today, didn't she?
The other girl is the star?
Joanne?
Nah.
Where's he?
You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?
You know what I'm talking about.
No.
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
Yeah, yeah, go on.
I'll admit it's confusing from the outside. You've got to see it from the inside.
Grand Rapids? Of course.
Look, I really don't know your daughter but...
She left you right?
Did you find out where she was?
Listen, Niki. My daughter's been missing five months. I've gone through a lot to find out what's happened to her. I just saw a girl killed. I will not let Tod slip out of my hands. You have to tell me where he is.
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
No, I didn't think she was. Let me get the picture here. Let me guess. She was an absolutely clean girl, a model daughter, she never had rebellious or impure thoughts, she didn't fuck around...
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.
As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.  Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper.
Hello?
This used to be a real city. I was here about fifteen years ago. Embezzlement case. It was always a little religious for my taste, but at least it was a city. With a downtown and all.
They're legal now.
It was called 'Slave of Love' when I bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll be called something else.
The police? They know less than you do.
I'm only human, you know.
Hey man.
Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism Jim.
Oh yeah? I've done a lot of good stuff. Shorts, features. No major roles it's true. But good stuff.
Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me.
Who told you about this?
What do you want?  Do I know you from somewhere?
Where's Ratan?
That film was a fake! Everything's phony...
Do you have a, ah, film called 'Slave of Love?'
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
But I...
Here. Take your fifty cents back.
I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...
I thought you were a businessman.
Hold it, mister.
Com'on, tell me.
What does that do?
Ssh. I'm on a stakeout.
I'm off that case. He fired me.
You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
And what are you studying?
Eh, Poli Sci?
Yes.
Come again.
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
A block of ice.
I don't know.
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
All right.
How about some ginger pie?
Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?
What do you think?
You don't look eighty.
That's a nice teapot.
What is it?
Thank you.
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
I <u>think</u> I see it.
The ice is melting.
I like Glaucus.
Did Confucius say that?
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
With God?
No. I'd feel stupid.
But they have.
Don't you advance on me.
You sure have a way with people.
- end where I began.
Why are there no photographs in these frames?
It looks like you. Thanks.
I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.
... which I hope will make you very happy.
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
Please, don't you realize? She is dying.
Mother.
This is insane.
Would you like a cigarette?
Do you play?
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
You mean when I'm not working on a...
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
Harold?
Your classmates?
Will they really teach me to shoot?
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
How about to slit his throat?
Parasite!
Stay where you are, Harold .
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Were you also the one who painted the statues?
Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?
It's a beautiful dress...
I knew you'd come back.
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
I... I had a visitor.
Help. No, no-one can help. I just want someone to listen or I WILL go crazy.
No bad dreams.
Get out of the way.
I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.
I've got to finish it.
I'm scared.
Nonsense, I...
What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust? Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?
I thought Steve had talked to you?
How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck
Red. How long was it latched onto you?
That's all for you, Sammy.
Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
If he's here, this is worse than I thought.
Do you believe in hell?
Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
Who's the squirt?
Got tired of me?
I don't want him.
That voice --
Each of us gets a belt.
Myers??? How's your arm?
No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
Hey. You: think twice --
Where do you --
Nah, sounds too "needy."
Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.
It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --
Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
What about you?
That you feel that way about me.
What's happening?
Will you sign for the bed?
Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
This isn't for real.
We want the man who did this --
Just in time.
Come to Daddy.
But you said --
What happened to you?
Well?
This is what began it.
Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
You would be. They tore me apart.
They took my body, but my spirit... they left that here. In the boards, in the walls. Watching the world, but not able to TOUCH it.
That's probably her now. Or the police.
Maybe we should just leave --
Kirsty.
Sure.
Kirsty? It's very late.
No, damn you --
Just a thought --
Not exactly modern.
How are you doing through there?
You're done worse.
Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
Who was it?
Not much fun, is it?
I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
No, not much.
I suppose not.
Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.
Oh Christ.
You're awake. Good girl.
I'll get the doctor.
What a pretty tune.
You wouldn't believe me.
What did you say?
What are you drinking, love?
I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.
Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
He's gone.
No you don't.
PLEASE. You're in danger.
Need any help?
You know I do know the way home.
Rob.  Rob Gordon.  Circa junior high...
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
What are you doing?
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
We'll do it next Monday.
Nice, Barry.
Not the point.
Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
What?
What are you snickering about?
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
Why would they care?
My band.
I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play.
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.  What about Television?
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.
He's got one!
May I help you?
Uh.  That's me.
Oh.  Okay.
Oh, I'm sure I can manage something... "Sin City." "New Rose," by The Damned. "Hit It and Quit It" by Funkadelic. "Shipbuilding," Elvis Costello, Japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway... um... "Mystery Train" by Elvis Presley... And... "Spaced Cowboy" by Sly and the Family Stone.  A bit controversial, I know, but...
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
Rob, hi, so sorry I missed your call. In LA on business.  You know how it gets.
Good weekend?
Great.
Let's not.
Rob.
Can I do anything?
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Jeez.  He goes on long enough.
Hi.
Are you coming home?
But don't you remember?
So you weren't interested in music at all?
But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet?
I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair to you.  That's why I came here to the store this evening.  I feel terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, you know.
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
Oh, Rob, shut up.
Yeah.  Great.
No problem.  If I can ask one question.
I don't know.
Never?
And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it?  The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob...  Are you there?  What are you thinking?
Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like.
Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
Sure they are.
Do you want me to be there?
Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.
You're soaking.
What about Ian?
Let's go home.  Okay?
C'mon.  I want to know.
But what?
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
You did that deliberately.  You knew all along I'd like them.  It was a trick.
About what?
Rob here.
What's happenin'.
Is Ray going?
Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
You share a place with T-Bone?
Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
Great.  Super-fantastic.
So so.  Up and down.
These are worth at least, I don't know --
It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.
I can't figure out why he's doing it. He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967.  And the guys rich.  You should see the stuff he has in that shop.
That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful.
Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
Would you remember his name?
This is against the rules.
Miss Cartwright, what is it I can do for you?
Byzantine?
Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
I don't know what you're talking about.
I have friends.
You did kill those men.
You make it all sound so simple.
You want me to front for you.
Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then.
Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.
Don't.
Forget it.
Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school.
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
I'm calling an attorney.
I want Taupin.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
Corey, you _owe_ me.
Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two.
Requiem acer'nam donaei-
Stop.
I did at that.
Hmm, que rico.  What is it you call this?
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
You feel you know me.
He told me there could be only one.
It is as you are.
You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.
Why does he want to kill me?
Aye.
The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
What is the fascinatioon?  It is only a leaf.
You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.
Go ahead, Senor.  I have my friend to keep me company.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?
Who am I deceiving?
Not so scared.
No doubt.
You're wrong.
Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
Do not turn your back on me.
Ah, Conor, how you look a man.
Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke.
Round up who you can and put them on standby.
Where!
_Answer_ me.
I love zoos.  Ever since I was a kid.
I knew his great-grandfather.
You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
What's the point?
Tradition.
Yes laddie, I have her.
My condolences.
Ah Steven, it is good to see you.
You're a kind man to be sure.
When your father died I saw to it that the grounds were kept up.
You're one of William's kids, huh?
Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike.
Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now.
Yes sir.  When you get older your priorities change.  It's the simple things that count.  Without them growing old can be a very lonely thing.
Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?
This is Murphy. More slop on the hanging.
Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
What doing?
Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ?  Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here.
I said -- uh -- I said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you.
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!
But --
Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
Hildy! Where's mother?
Did you give her the money?
Mr. Burns --
But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
Mother? But your mother --
How's business, Bruce?
But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
I feel I ought to take care of her.
And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here...
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.
If you've any accusations to make, Hartman, make them in the proper manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask you to get out.
I can explain that, Hartman. When Hildy told me she wanted to interview Earl Williams I thought it might be dangerous and I gave her a gun to defend herself.
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.
Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in? I meant to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I did.
You've got to help me, Hildy.
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
Bermuda.
You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me.
How can you have any happiness after that? All through the years you'll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl Williams' face will come between you on the train tonight -- and at the preacher's tomorrow -- and all the rest of your lives!
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!
She jumped out of the window.
You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald! 
You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.
Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!
We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?
Hildy!
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
Railroad tickets.
Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
Where is she? Tell me!
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
Don't open that!
No!
Wait a minute!  Let go there!
Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
What!
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
Hello, Hildy! What are you doing around here?
How much?
Let's see the money.
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
I call. What you got?
Who locked the door?
Hey!
She looks as though she's going to come to.
A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
She says she's gonna write fiction.
You ain't gettin' out o' here!
All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
Take your paws off me!
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference.
Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a few hours before you make any decisions. I'll get results. I'm doing everything humanly possible. I've just sworn in four hundred deputies.
That gives you an idea of what I'm up against!
Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
No -- don't out me off.
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
We'll fix that, too. 
A sight for sore eyes!
You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!
And so do I!
Nobody's going to rush me into anything!  You keep away from me! 
Who is it?
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?
Did you get that, Hildy?
If Walter Burns calls, hold the wire for me, will you? I'll be right back. 
I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your "Production for Use".
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you. 
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
What's that?
They'll get him! They'll get him!
What's from the Governor?
They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from fishing.
How much do you make a week?
Who? Me?
Why not?
But how do I know...?
You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has to do.
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
Look out!
Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life.
Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding.  Come in, Dave Schwartz.
Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?
What are you doing here? This is our territory
Bloody.
They pulled them up from all the crossroads, so when the Germans land they'll lose their way.
He's never going to come back. He's gone off to be a soldier and Mummy doesn't even know.
You couldn't.
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.
I did see them. I did.
You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
Take it away. I know your husband's been away a long time, but....
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
What did we know? We were seventeen.
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.
It looks a bit fishy to me.
It seems to have survived.
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
Molly!
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
Tiny's home.
Ma, Tiny's in.
I'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat.
Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.
Drink up, it's party time.
Aw, I was going home to my Mamma's house... yeah, I was out doing this thing.
OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
That's not something to joke about.
No! He's one of God's creatures, he can't help it if he's dumb... I'm just crazy about animals.
I'd like to see that.
Can I help you with something?
Do you believe this fucking girl?
Why? You gonna do something about it?
You see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions. You know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
Hold on, I've heard this before... but I can't remember the end.
Shit, we really need to find some gas.
I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about.
Keep straight on this road here.
Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to.
It's a hitchhiker.
What was that?
OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out just yet.
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
Don't forget the flashlight, it's pretty dark out there.
Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right, Bill?
Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
Fuck! We are fucked!
Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.
Why are we stopping?
Go around him.
How much is a person supposed to stand?
What are you doing!
Come on, get with the facts.
What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?
How's about you give me those same directions.
You sure you don't need any help in there?
Huh?
Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.
So what?
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
We've got get out of here, we got get out of here.
Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.
Rise and shine.
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway.
I think I'm going fucking crazy.
She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.
What was that?
Recover any bodies?
That's the understatement of the year.
What'd ya got there?
Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.
We hit the jackpot! Let's roll, good buddy. We got ourselves a convoy.
That stupid hillbilly slut.
I know you're my guests and welcome but I'd please advise you to keep from cussing while in my house, thank you.
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
Please, could I please come in and talk to you for a minute? Maybe you could take a better look at the picture... might stir up something.
Thank you.
Think... do any of these kids look familiar in any way?
Get in... now!
Turn up this road.
Jesus Christ.
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.
Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us.
Boss, the way I see it is these kids probally stop off somewhere, bought a bunch of booze and are off getting shitfaced.
Your Spidey senses tingling.
Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
Don't worry, we'll find her.
And?
Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not sorry she killed him, if it means I can have you. Is that a terrible thing to say, my sweet?
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
Thank you so much for accompanying me.
I am sleepy.
Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
Gabby, what is it?
Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
What?
You were wonderful!
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong.
I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back.
I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.
A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
That's what I'm counting on.
Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt.
My brother says he likes you, too.
Yeah?
No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking "do not disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob?
How'd you know where I was?
Your brother should have his license revoked.
I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.
Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.
Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.
Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?
I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that.  Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
Come on.
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality.
What are you doing in there?
Who is it?
Who from work?
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
So, how's it going today?
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are!
Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!
Puff, I'm proud of you! You did remarkably well under difficult circumstances.
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
This is great, Puff. You're doing fine.
Extra dessert?
I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.
Thanks to you, Nate.
Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.
You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
I'm ready.
It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.
To win.
You bastard.
I'll make it up to you.
Oh, we'll start small... a hundred dollars a game.
I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.
Do you really think you can beat him?
Poker's not your game.
Eddie, you're a born loser.
Seventy-five per cent.
Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way.
Hey, wait.  What are you gonna do about the money?
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
He's a gentleman. Gentleman gambler. He gets his kicks playing with hustlers. He's got an old Southern mansion with a pool table in the basement, drinks eight-year-old bourbon, smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.
You must have a lot of confidence in me.
Here, I got it.
Well, we won't.
Sure.
How do we stand?
When do I raise the bet?
I'll beat him the next game.
I can beat him, Bert. Now he suckered me 'cause he knows how to hustle. I didn't think he did. But I can outplay him. I can beat him.
Half.
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
You name it, we shoot it.
You ought to take up crap shooting. Talk about luck!
Whaddya mean?
Well... well, now.
Ten grand. I'm gonna win ten grand in one night.  ...Well, who's gonna beat me? C'mon, Charlie, who's gonna beat me?
How much we got?
Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."
Oh yeah? Where?
Yeah, to play Fats again.
You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
Just like that?
That's right. When?
Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink?
Hey, uh, mister? Hey, okay if I grab a cue?
Who's he?
Gimme ten bucks.
Hi.
Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.
I guess it's just you and me, huh?
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
You sure you don't want to quit, friend?
Just a cup of black coffee, please...  Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute!  Would you, uh, like another cup?
Yours.
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?
You don't look like a college girl.
Hey!
How did you know my name was Sarah?
Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
Well, I believe you when you say you go to school.
Do you want me to go?
What are you writing?
What happened?
Sarah, do you think I'm a loser?
You need the words?
You glad?
Well, what's so funny?
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
Go on back to the hotel.
Where do you come from?
Hundred dollars?
...you shoot a great game of pool.
You -- think I am -- I'm --  -- an animal.
Are you all right?
What about... now?
Humans.
Good evening.  Did you have a pleasant day today?
Son ... are you awake?
I know, Ellen.  We'll settle down soon.
I have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping. This house needs just <u>everything</u>. I'll probably be gone all day. Jimmy, hurry up and eat or you'll be late.
It's probably the solenoid.  Take it back to Gleason's, they said they'd fix it if we found anything wrong.
What happened to you?  Who was that?
I'm home now.
We were having a little talk.
What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
Stay here.  I'm going to make a phone call.
Hi.  Sorry I'm late.
It's all this moving from place to place.  We're never settled.  I'm having nightmares myself.
What?
Just my luck, no ice.
He still gets air sick, huh? In all of this I didn't get the chance to thank you two.
Spunky. He told you about that?
I don't know how you put up with him.
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
Then what?
Spunky?
You try Martin?
Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
David, David! What the hell are you doing!?
This I can see.
Pops, you're a genius!
What the hell are you doing?
We're loose!
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
Any news on my wife?
Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?
Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.
How're we doing?
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
Do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered.
Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
This is ridiculous.
How do you know?
It's doing what?
Be careful.
You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
You're late.
And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
Damn it!
Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.
Stop it.
I don't need it.
It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
They let you out?
Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.
How' he doing?
I'm not leaving.
What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
Your treat.
Dad?
Venice, Italy!
But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.
Ah, Venice...
Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
Henry! What are you doing here?!
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."
Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
I usually don't either.
It would make me very happy.
Bingo.
The Ark of the Covenant.
I said go around!
Knock it off. You're not mad.
No. You like the way I do things.
What are you going to do?
This one. I think he's in here.
All I have to do is squeeze.
I never expected to see you again.
It is you Junior!
Oh, it breaks the heart.
Through the library?
Found it.
Rats?
You did!!
Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?  So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi?
How did you she was a Nazi?
Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
Dad!
What?
Come on, Dad. Come on!
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
We didn't talk. We never talked.
I didn't know you could fly a plane.
Dad -- eleven o'clock!!
Dad?!
The penitent man is humble before God.
What did you find, Junior?
Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
Where's my father?
Why are you trying to kill us?
Dr. Jones, you know very well that the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century.
Interested in local curios?
The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive.
Then she must have run out of the room and you found her.
Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi --
Hard to believe, isn't it...?
Miss Scott, you're not making any sense.
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
You got the tickets, Short Round?
Come one, what's wrong?
There were five stones in the beginning. Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you...
Give me the stones!
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?
I'll take the extra ticket.  Where's this plane going anyway?
So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
India...
God, I am starving, but I can't eat this...
Took what?
Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me!
Where'd you find your little bodyguard?
What about the future?
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.
You're dying to come into my room, aren't you?
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
A fulcrum release lever!
There's a hole! I found a square hole!
Oh my God! He ripped out his -- he killed him!
Wait -- what're you doing?
What're we going to do?!
Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!
Anymore ideas...?
I get it!
This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.
I said something.
Try me.
I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!!
Arrrgh!
You're in my head...
Somebody's been here.
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
I told you, my name is Al.
What are you doing?
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
What was that?
Anyone there?
I wouldn't say that.
JOE Or what?
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
Yeah...Who is?
You are CRAZY!
Which way do I go?
Corridor A.
Like the guys that attacked us.
You need ID in there?
I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
I'm back.
Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.
What about money?
...and a license to kill...
Now what?
The beach?
Swim.
Eat it?
It's sand.
You're beautiful..
Help me out, will you?
What?
Where is she staying?
Without your pants.
Not that tie with that coat.
What did that cost?
Just don't show fear.
Joe, be careful!
Voice stress analyzer.
You're doing great with her.
And on my time.
Relax. Make your mind a blank.
Yeah...You've fallen for her.
...drink it.
Ow!
Door to the right. Get up and run.
I don't trust her.
Plenty of circuits in a Walkman...
He hung us up dry.
It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.
Aim just in front of his face.
Do something.
I have been... I think you're right.
You're a lucky man.
She's so lovely. It's all my fault...I was wrong.
Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
JOE What abilities...?
I'm...scared.
Nice?
Impossible.
You didn't tell us you were coming?
Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here.
Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
Don't you want to get out?
Not...complaining, actually.
Now you know what I know.
The fresh tuna?..
Yes...What is it?
What did you say?
Is someone else here?
The poet...something he said...
If I was with you, I wouldn't
No. Ryuji just hires us.
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
Who else is interested in me?
Who did?
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
You don't believe me.
Who was?
This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
That must be him. Water taxi.
Where what?
What?
Chiang Cho?
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
What happened?
Kiss her you fool.
It wasn't me. It was him.
He told me what to do.
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
Wait.
You can't take that.
Right there.
Screw the PEM...What about Al...
He's into kind of little cars, that...
Just ran into two of your "geologists." Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...?
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
We gotta hook up.
P.J.'s.
Are you all right?
These are their leads, their sources. I want you to have your reporters...
Shit...
Alright, alright.
I can't get out of here til mid- morning. I'll be in tomorrow night...  Listen, could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi...
Do you want more rice?
What are you cooking?
No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
Hello?
Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
I don't understand.
What's going on?
Please don't wash your hands in the sink.
Jeffrey Wigand...
"I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'" You know, you take the "60 Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand's right. Maybe I'm hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? "60 Minutes"? What the hell for? Infotainment. It's so fucking useless, all of it.
Yeah...
...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...
He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs...
Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
Give me a break!
How have you liked your stay?
Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow.
Did work.
What do...
It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement?
You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway.  How are your kids handling the new house?
Hello. You there
The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have.  I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake...  I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's.  I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around!
Yes.
"Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within..."
Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?
ABC Telemarketing Company.
That's not the point.
I think I need to call the police. He won't respond...
Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all.  You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry.  So, what were you calling about?
I heard you. But I got to arrange a legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.
All of us did. There was this whole line of people... whole line of CEOs up there all swearing.
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.
"You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?"
Object!
My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
Is that a threat?
Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
And how is Mrs. Reiser?
So she's uh, flourishing?
What a touching story.
You're in a rush.
Objection, your honor!
Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
I'm happy for you, pal.
My God.
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
Marylin! What have I done?
I begged you to have a baby!
Well. He said to "make the house mine."
How nice.
These are yours.
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon?
Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend?
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
Getting married.
He's passionate.
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
I'd like to offer my congratulations. That was a beautiful gesture of Howard's.
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
To victory.
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
Hmmm...
And here I thought my mother was...
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
I want to be your -- your wife.
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
I don't have a ring!
Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
Good.  Are those foods?
You don't like me?
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
Comfy!
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
It's a no go, Joe.
You were going to have this thug...?
Income tax evasion?
Rex. Get away from the door.
Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.
Are you alright? You lost weight.
Who's that?
He never even asked. He just assumed --
She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.
Miles Massey.
Lilly's up.
Every week --
Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.
Is this Ming?
I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch.
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
Wait. I know you.
Herb wants to see me?
That's delusional.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
And it's good!
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
Nothing?
In anticipation of making you sick.
Wait... He wants to give her...?
Wrigley!
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
Let me tell you something about Patty.
Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.
Three is not Farrow.
Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish.
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
How is she?
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
Can't you get them to go any faster?  This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing.
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
I might.
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
I knocked several times.
You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'mI'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questionsI  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
Ridiculous!
But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why
Yes, I guess I have.  I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous.  Besides, what difference does it make?  I'll never see Peter again.
Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward.
Are you going to see him?
Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
It's my daughter! Go after her.
What about that diamond wrist watch she had onshe can raise some money on that?
What would you like to have me do?
Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston.  "Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible." Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston.
Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
Never mind, son. She doesn't want it. 
We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday.
Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?
The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
That's a long story, my friend. You see, I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants.
Driver!
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
No. I'd rather you didn't.
Take my advicegrab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony.
That's right. You didn't.
Of course I do. What do you mean
Darn clever, these Armenians.
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
That, I suppose, makes everythinguhquite all right.
I have an idiosyncrasy all my own. You'll notice my coat came firstthen the tiethen the shirtnow, according to Hoyle,[5] the pants should come next. But that's where I'm different.  go for the shoes first. After that I
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
You'll find the showersand thingsright back of the second cottage. 
Where is the shower?
Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
KingKing Westley was in it.
Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
I better go over and see her.
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.
Aren't you afraid of me?
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding.
Not a one.
What's got into you?
I wasn't gone more than a minute. Just went out to find you something to eat.
If it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come.  Got a toothpick?
But the thumb always works. Different ways to do it, though. Depends on how you feel. For instance, number one is a short, jerky movement  That shows independence. You don't care if they stop or not. 'Cause you got some money in your pocket, see?
Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
Eat a carrot.
Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
What happened?
Any luck?
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
I hope you got your money.
Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?
Where's the bus to New York?
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that busI told them to wait!
No, he ain't! And the car's gone, too.
SorryI didn't mean to
I've been thinking about you.
Heyyou not up yet? Come oncome on!
I said, the old man's screwy!
Up yonder. See the lights?
Here's another wire from Peter Warne.
Collect?
Get out of here!
A thousand dollars!  Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.
If it's on the level.
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
'Bye, Agnes. You're beautiful. All women are beautiful!  Gordon is immediately electrified into action.
If you ask me, I don't believe they're married.
You send telegrams here?
Go on. Go on send the telegram.
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
See that. They're gone!
Not a minute!
Wife?
What's up?
Yeahthe "big boy"the Boss of the outfit.
Oh, thanks, thanks, Mister. I always knew you guys were kind-hearted.
Boss, Oswald impersonators?  Sounds like James Bond now.
William Walter, the night clerk on duty here in the FBI office, gave me a copy of this.  It went all over the country.  Nothing was done, and the motorcade went ahead on schedule - and this wasn't even mentioned in the Warren Report!  Read it, Al.
Did he pay?
Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
Who the hell opened my files!  You've been looking through my private files, haven't you, you weasel?
Bill.
It's addressed to no one and no signature.  "To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect.  I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome."
I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill, even if you're family.  He's a big shot businessman.  I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by another name down here.
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
He had his palm print on the weapon.
I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson got $1 billion for his Texas friends, Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh Bay for the military in Vietnam. That's just for openers.
With a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up?  Y'ever read your Shakespeare, Bill?
Julius Caesar:  "Brutus and Cassius, they too are honorable men."  Who killed Caesar?  Twenty, twenty-five Senators.  All it takes is one Judas, Bill - a few people, on the inside, Pentagon, CIA...
What's it look like, Nick?
...Oswald?
I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
You still questioning any Cubans?
Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
I believe the boys got a couple.
Did you take a good look at the TV when they had Oswald?
What about Ruby?
I don't remember his name.  You must understand it was quite crowded, and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the President who is dead, you don't look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are.
No.
Are we going away, Daddy?
I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.
We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?
Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
I don't believe it!
I'm sorry.
No.  Never heard of him.
After dinner you paid him to have sex with you.
Let me show you his picture. 
Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
This says "Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck."  That's not true.  I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  And here...  ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange.  See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning.  I guess that's all...
One hour, y'hear?  Some Saturday night date you are.  Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man.
We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim.
Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
Did you enter Virginia into a beauty contest?
Get a hold of yourself.
I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  Spend a week.  I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.
And if you're wrong?
I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.
Anything else unusual about him you'd be able to describe in a court of law, Willie?
Remember whose office this was back in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?
You don't get it, guys - he can't go down any further.  We got to protect him full time.
When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.
You know who the mayor was?
General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw.
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
Pictures like this don't show up on television!
...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.
I knew the man 20 years.  That's him.  The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring.  What was he doing there?  If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say "protection" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of "okay" signal to those hoboes - they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered.  And in fact they were - you never heard of them again.
Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say. 
Even my own wife, chief,  Who's wondering where I am?
Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?
But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
This looks pretty good on me.
Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
You see, it works like this. You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out. That's my job. And I don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you?
Why were you with him?
I'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. What would you say Ray?
What's she want?
Can I have a word with you?
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?
You should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it. You forgot or what? You could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine, plus two years in prison. Now you want to talk to us about it, or you want to talk to Customs?
Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking.
I gave you my card there.
Who put up my bond? Ordell?
They wanted you to tell them what you know.
You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.
I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
Yeah, if I cooperate.
What'dya think?
Want to hear some music?
I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.
'76?
You're gonna offer to set him up?
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
Well, hello.
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
And Annette's it for you?
Who was your girl before Annette?
Bring the money in and they follow it?
He was here?
You think he's got a thing for you?
I see.
He tries to act cool.
You're avoiding the question.
I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.
I'm not sure you answered my question.
You're rationalizing.
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
How'd you find out?
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell.
That's Ordell's.
I didn't use you, Max.
Who's side are you on?
Most of the times.
Yes'm.
He say is a surprise.
Look, that shit ain't mine.
We'll just be a minute.
Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
How can you help us?
What for?
...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
I'm sure that was the idea.
She didn't say.
Uh-huh.
That would be one point of view.
You took the time to pay the saleswoman.
What did you do after that?
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you.
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.
You already knew that?
For what?
I'magine they asked who you givin' it to, too.
And what was your answer?
Yeah?
What do you think it is?
Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.
Yeah.
I bet you come here on a Saturday night, you need nigga repellent keep 'em off your ass.
How the fuck they know that?
What the fuck's that got to do with it?
If you want.
Can you cover that?
I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
Who's paging you?
When did you get out of jail?
Four years?
What for?
You okay?
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
That was taken at a place called "Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. back then?
Where were you?
C'mon, don't lie.
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
Thanks, Baby.
Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
Whatcha watchin'?
Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.
Who was that?
Who was Beaumont?
If this is about you fucked Melanie, I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool. I leave you alone with a bitch like Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that twenty minutes after I'm out the door. So say "thank you" and I'll tell you, "you're welcome."
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
Where did you shoot her?
Where's the rest of it?
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
You know who I saw in the dress department?
I'm going out for a few hours.
So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral?
Who's it for? A relative?
He takes off and I gotta go to Kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses.
Do you know what he's on probation for?
House or apartment?
It still sounds high.
I got it. I just don't got it on me.
Falsely accused of Intent. If she had that shit -- and mind you, I said "if" -- it was just her shit to get high with.
What the fuck you doin' knockin on the door like the goddamn police? You lookin' to get shot?
That's all?
You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her?
Well, give it to me then.
Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd already tried to get Jackie to go in with her, split the half million amongst themselves. What she did was take quite a risk to see you get your money.
This place stinks.
She's been there since Thursday night.
Hello.  Hey, Jackie...  No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
Hope you don't mind keeping him company.
He ain't here right now.
Dream on!
Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
Grass never did that to me.
Well, try, huh.
Listen, will you listen? They're trying to get me. They're comin' out of the walls. The army's done something to me. I need you.
You mind? I'm eating, huh?
I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it.
What'd he say that for? What made him say that? Strange, huh? Strange.
He say what they looked like?
Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
I can't relax.
Louis, you're a life saver.
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
Ah. Neither snow nor sleet, nor dark of night ... I always admired that.
Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
Not according to my charts. Do you have an appointment?
What's your name?
I'm sorry but there's no record of a Jacob Singer in our files.
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
What was that?
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
She was good in bed, though.
I'm not dead. I am not dead.
Why didn't you turn on the light?
Gee, thanks a lot.
What happened to you?
Where'd you leave 'em?
Thanks.  What's that?
Who? Jed?
And look what I got.
Look at these, will ya? I don't believe it. Jesus, these are fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ... And here's my brother, when we were down in Florida.
Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it.
It's still there, Jake.  Even if you never say a word about it. You can't spend two years in Vietnam ...
You okay?
Can't you stop it?
What's it say? A hundred and two?
What does it say?
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
Don't gimme that.
Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind.  Love me a little?
How come? The army?
It's just me.
Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that.
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
Bullshit!
What's going on?
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
Why won't you answer me?
Where's West? New Jersey?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
"Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil," but no one ever said I wouldn't be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  Stick out your tongue.  That'a boy. Now why don't you just lie down and relax.
It was paradise, Michael. You showed it to me. You were there.
I would have stayed there if I could.
Excuse me, do you know if we've passed Nostrand Avenue yet?  Excuse me.  Look, I'm asking a simple question. Have we hit Nostrand Avenue? I fell asleep.
Push 'em back.
Lennox Hospital.
I'm sorry.
Speaking.
You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed?
Still married, Jake?
You and everybody else. God I hate this area. Makes me nervous.
I don't know.
It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
Don't do anything.  Paul, I know what you're talking about.
What is it Paul? What's happening to me?
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
Okay, enough of this shit.
Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks.
Goodbye old friend.
What are you doing?!!
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
We can't lead him into the other hull!
Can we blow it with just two?
His mother?
The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. When it  reaches the core, we're done.
Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
Uh-oh.
Where have you been?!!
Nice touch.
We're not supposed to do that.
I'll need system four converters.
Hey! I'm not ready.
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
Goodbye, my love.
We'd need charges.
How many?
Hurry!
It bought us some time.
Boeman, the ships not here.
Get them in the lab!
Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
Sergeant!
He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it.
I need to know what you know about this guy.
You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!!
Kicker, anything?
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
What if you miss?
They were all wrong. They couldn't control him.
See? We're not so bad.
Did you like it?
Spunky . . .
God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
He's trying to ask you out on a date.
They're not gonna make it. Close the door before he gets us all.
Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.
You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?
What are you doing?
What do we do?!!
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...
Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.
I didn't say I was good at it.
Almost done.
I gotta go back.
I'm sending you the files.
Where..? Who . . .?  I'm alive. You brought me back.
Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...
That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.
You're not going anywhere.
More soldiers?
The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
And incidental damages, if any...
How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.
What's that one, there?
He's comin' up -- !
Right.
Don't forget these.
You're very tight, y'know?  Right there.
Can you stand something to eat?
Colorful, isn't he?
Martin!  Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority?
Larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. But they got him!
Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.
Got a pen on you?
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?
Well, if one man can catch a fish in 50 days, then I guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day -- beginner's luck.
We ought to let it breathe... Whatever.
Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
Where'd you get all this?
You all right?
Wait a minute! I need you.
You here for the summer?
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...?
I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...
You wanna call it a night after here?
My husband tells me you're in sharks.
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
I don't know what it is, but it's not a shark.
Over there!
Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off.
Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...
Go Carole.  So, guess what?
When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time.
Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
What's up?
Really? What are they like?
Leah just told me you were going with her.
You're being really immature.
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that?
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?
But they have a real lawyer and everything. I'm going to meet with them next weekend.
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.
No.
Viscera?
It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender.
Like what?
Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child.
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
Argento's good, but Lewis is completely demented. We're talking buckets of goo. Red corn syrup everywhere. And fake brains up the yin-yang.
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
Cold feet.
Hello?
Oh really? What's the verdict?
Wow. That shirt is working hard.
You do?
I'm leaving Vanessa.
Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
Is the baby okay?
Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.
Juno? What's going on?
Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
What?
Did you say you were thinking about adoption?
Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds.
Hi Dad.
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
Look at this one "Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple have found true love with each other."  "All that's missing is your bastard."
You're not listening to me.
Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.
Aw, please Junebug?
How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters?
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously.
God, why is everyone always staring at me?
Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
What did you do?
You lose!
One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke...  Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
Better not, or Early'd whip me.
...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
The police are after him, he's a murderer!
I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
Early, what're you doin'?
What the hell is this stuff?
What's wrong with her?
So what do you do Early?
Now why is that?
That your... "theory", ain't that what they call it?
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri?
So tell me... what happened here?
Okay, now you want to talk about good versus evil? Well then let's start with Adam and Eve and the snake.
Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California.  "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
I like that.
Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around.
Carrie.
There's more...
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
What about you?
Nervous?
...Soon as he finishes his thesis.
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
...never?
...You know what I mean?
You be at this personnel office, Friday, three o'clock sharp.
What happened?
What about the owner of the house...  ...this John Diebold, any idea where he might be?
Yes. Altogether.
How many times have you gone unprotected?
Oh man, that's the best.
Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
Probably.
It is right.
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
Darcy. Benny's little sister.
It's funny. Last weekend at that block party. Remember?
I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
About ten. Fifteen is good.
You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?
Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.
Man we fucked him up.
No I'm serious. Can I suck your tit? Either of you guys. I don't care.
Hey.
I was lookin' for you all day today.
I thought you had a girlfriend.
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.
Jennie, Jennie. How do you feel?
What is it?
Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it.
You know what I want to do?
You know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise.
Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.
No. I'm OK. Thanks.
No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
You are being ripped open.
Like where are your erogenous zones?
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.
Uh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg?
How can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk.
I hate 'em.
No. I was just kidding.
Hi mom.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
What are you guys doing?
Where does everyone sleep?
Slow.
Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever
I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.
Are you crazy?
Then let's narrow it down.
We're interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there.
You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
Yes you are.
Remember eventually revenge is carefully...  Have you tired juxtaposing the words?
We'll find the evidence.
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
Hello, Peter.
Why not?
I did another one last night.  You might have saved her, but you didn't want to play.
I know where you are.
Yes, I do.  I found your file.  I know what happened.
Nope.  Nothing.
Now what?
Computers.  That's how you got into Homesearchers records.  You can get into anything.  But why?  Why?
You might not have done it had you known.
The police came to me for help.  What could I do?
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
So, are you having a good time on the Island?
Congratulations, dad.
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
Don't you have something you want to say to David?
Whaddaya got, Nolan?
He tapes their mouths shut.  We found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths.  We're doing a chemical analysis for components, but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store.
What do you think he did?
No.  I told him to.  I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end.
Yes.  Why disguise your voice if no one knows it?
His home would be... Mount Olympus.
Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.
What time did he get there?
He's right, Kathy.
And what if he's wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him.  If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.
This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
Could you tell me where you were last night?
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
What have you come up with on the riddle?
That's it?
I still don't see how he could be playing chess against you.  There's only enough grids on the map to be half a board.
Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
--but you enjoy being the stronger one? You like the control.
Do you always open quickly?
Well, I think I've had enough.
Why?
Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
Nothing.
He's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces.  All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse.  Why?
Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
This letter.  I've never opened it.
You beat him.
No, I want you to do good.  That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
I'm not nervous.
Me too.
Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
Have they harmed you?
Will your power outward.
You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
You choose these?
They know when they're going to die?
<u>Why</u>?
But you suspect.
Never.
Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!
She must make a glaive.
She's on the other side of this wall. I can feel it!
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
I know the cruelty of such a fate.
Your kingship ... your lord high mightiness ... when I called you a ... a ... whatever I called you, I didn't realize that you were ... were ...
Fame is what you leave to your sons.
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
I'm not hungry.
Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.
The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories.
Make for the wall. I'll catch up.
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.
Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
But also very young. Six to one is no odds, boy.
And do you think I live on air?
I can't hold the weight of both of you!
He didn't join them. They joined him.
I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
It's a lie!
What news from our friends?
For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
A fine match.
Can you see?
We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
Look.
But you would not stay with me.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
Knowledge.
It will not help.
What's that man's name?
He forgot his money...  My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.
Give me his name, I will mail him.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
...Good...  But what's special in him?
It's better...  You see, it's my turf, so I don't want contracts I'm not informed about, on my turf.  I'm not opposing, but the least they can do is informing me, isn't it?
No, no.
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
130... 140...
Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss.  A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.
Good! First shot!
I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
Not taken.
...You don't believe me, don't you?
It's cool departing this way... warm... music...
Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, I make you notice.
You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
Well... I don't know, suddenly, the make up... All this... How are you?  Are you OK?
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
May I ask you a personal question?
How shall we get out now, Leon?
You say it just to calm me!
I think I will get back in Messina this summer... It's too long I haven't been there.
Do you recognize him?
Listen, son, you know as well as me this kind of hitmen: they come from nowhere, get the contract and disappear. They're lonely, worse than wolves.
He probably just went somewhere.
Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?
And your store?  What about your new store?  What about all your dreams?
She was being symbolic.  What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
Then it'll have to wait until I finish.
What would you like us to do?
I know what you're getting at.
Yes?
Ellen?
Is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
Walk with me?
I want children.
Why there?
Maurice?
Why?
Your parents would want you to be in bed.
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
This story is big huh?
Lizy, Eliza... Elizabeth Bennett...  Pride and Prejudice.
I'm walking there Kris.
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
You're walking to California?
Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her.
Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.
Ellen got up every morning and went to the corner store to get me my bread for breakfast... Everyday. Now that's about a quarter mile each way... 17 years... that comes to about three thousand miles...  And you know what Kris?
Tom Joad?
I haven't been too punctual with the rent.
Are they standing?
Is it a boy or a girl?
Hello, Mr. Parker.
He wants to reward you... That's why I'm here.
I really want that watch.
Water?
Are you working?
Isn't it illegal to drink and drive?
Sarah -- with an H?
What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?
Yes.
We should pick up a bottle of tequila on the way. I owe you one.
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
How long have I been here?
Me neither.
Sera... I hope that you understand how I feel about this. First of all, you're welcome to my money. We can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest. But I don't think you're talking to me right now about money.
No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.
Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
What was that all about?
Thank you, Sera.
So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
You have been lonely?
It is, after all, Sera, my money.
A full night on the street and this is all?
Go, Sera.  Go. Stay at home. I will call you tomorrow.
Yes, but your major is Fashion Merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced "History of Lycra". What are your backups?
Brooke, I believe you. But a jury is gonna want an alibi.
I'll take that as a no.
But is he an ass that's gonna win my case?
It's so shameful...
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
No!
What's going on?
I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?
Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?
Did you get it?
Good work today, Ms. Woods.
I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
Was she carrying a weapon?
So she was distraught that her husband was dead?
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:03.
Yes?
What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
You ready?
I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I'm the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty.
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.
Uh -- family.
It's not my alibi to tell --
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.
You're pawning The Rock?!
Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond.
Here. You're gonna need this.
Keep June first open -- you're one of my bridesmaids. And give Warner our love.
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson.
Good luck.
Why?
But maybe it's not what you think.
How can you still believe she's innocent?
Back up. How do you know he's gay?
Whoa -- Why?
As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
No -- it's just -- not me.
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
What?
You don't really believe she's innocent?
And I fully support that.
I'm sorry, Elle, I just --
Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the benches?
And what is your boyfriend's name?
Aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas. Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house.
Why so few?
We come watch... we come watch...
Fire moat... why do that?
We watch... good fun...
You go to lady now?
On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
And you... are you not also afraid?
Why have you brought me here?
Damn you!
Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me...
And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures...
To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
You come stealee tleasoo?
Friend Ogg.  Excuse our enthusiasm, occasioned as it was by a fondness for you.
No... I... I need to rest.
Why, Jack-lad, she likes you, is all.  And what hot-blooded hero wouldn't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like Oona here...?  If your blood runs so cold, boy, you be a corpse before your time.
Elderberry wine.  No finer drink under heaven.
That much magic I can offer ye, a small measure of entertainment at best.  Making the world a frozen hell is beyond me modest powers.
Someone worthy of respect, lad.  She be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  Hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them.
Are we here?
Here now.  Toss her this when you've the chance.  Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass.  She's terribly vain.  Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle.
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
So I'm to be a dragon-slayer, is that it?
Pregnant, is she?
Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.
Track the demon to his lair.
We must follow that bird.
Beware.
How do we follow a raven we can't even see?
Good.
Twould appear other travelers precede us.
I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
My God!  Look!
Certainly understandable.
I pray always to be worthy of it.
Tis not the sword that counts, but the man what swings it.  Rest easy, Jack.
Make haste!  We've a hard day's march ahead.
God's blessing.
Wait!
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
Why not admit it, Honeythorn Gump. We've lost our way entirely.
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
Aye.  We be on a quest to set the world aright --
That be so, better you pinch yourself now, Jack.
There isn't much time!
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
Jack!  The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower.  No sign of... Jack?  Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad.
Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
Can't we move any faster?
He's getting away!  He was at my mercy!
Ever wondered why Jenny Greenteeth said you needed the fastest steed on earth?
Ride like wild fire, Jack.
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes --
Keep me belly full, Jack.  Kill us another worm.
Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or --
It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport.
Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn?
A gentleman would offer water.
Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.
What happened?
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
He did run?
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
What have I done?
It's the Baron's damnable work!  Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself.
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
What's the matter?
Biting you?
Never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday.
I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
I'd be honored.
How so?
Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
Please...
The fastest in the world.
Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird...
Each fit for a hero... My uncle fashioned a hammer for Thor.  Twas he named it Mjolnir.  Grandfather forged Excalibur... You won't ever see finer craftsmanship.
How came you by this blade?
Uhm... fine work.
It be the castle... we feel the castle... it be that close...
Marco!
And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color I liked best!  And he said he loved me!
When does George get to come see his house?
What's that for?
So put your plans of my room in the trash.
I'd be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom.
Did you feel anything?
You should stay.
He's a freak.
I might not stay, anyway.
This is serious!  I don't have my license.  He was my ride.
I've seen lots of people.  It's not a big thing for me.
I was wondering.
I thought I was helping you.
You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.
Mr. Stevens?
I hate to ask about a window.
I'm good, thanks.
Right...she married...what was he?
Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
Listen...maybe I can get you a year.
Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor.
Well, I feel better about this now.
I've got one favor to ask.
Is Alyssa home?
Sam?
Thanks for the shower.
Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
Hello?
Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
I'm not going!
I hate turkey.
I don't beg.
I was holding for someone.  That wasn't even mine.
I'll have to pay him back.
That's not true.
I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
What would you be doing now?
If I asked you to stop, would you?
I'm proud of you, Sam.
Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
She seemed upset.
I mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what?  Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain.  And you're going through them quick.
I still don't know what that means.
No one's really said four months is all you have, have they?
I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.
I aimed high.
God, you look like crap, George.
How many bedrooms will your house have?
Because Dad left?
You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
Kurt's been feeding him.
I need to talk to you.
There's nothing anymore to stop me.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
No.  I was going to let you do that.
I did say he could go.
George --
I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
It's not breakfast yet.
Oh...with his ear infection!
Do you need anything?  I'll go to the pharmacy.  I have some Demerol at home.
Do you need help?
Nothing is going on with us, is it?
Peter left me yesterday.
I better get the kids home.
What's your deal with Alyssa?
He already knows everything about what he can't do.  You can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.
The biggest waste of time since television.
I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.
Where are the kids?
No.
Hey.
I guess I could teach you some things.
What are you doing in my room?
You could keep it and rent it out?
Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
Go tell your father we're eating.
She's doing just fine.
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
Yeah...
Sharp.
Damn dentures slipping again. Everything falls apart when you grow old, eh, Claude? Time sure marches on.
Craddock!... Williams... Henshaw!... Banks!
Engagement ring!
Can't you remember your own name?
Good, I'm looking forward to meeting this Spanky. Give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess.
That's right, a loan officer.
Like this?
Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude.
You're soft.
Reward?
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
What do you think you're doing?! The man's been dead for two seconds! Don't you have any respect?
Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?
Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
Does that mean I'm in?
Come on, Ray, time to go!
Keep it together, Claude. You wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.
Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
What you're dealing with here is a complete lack of talent.
Judge must have money riding on the championship.
It's a pardon from the governor.
You show them Crawfords how to play ball.
He said they keep it parked out behind the barn. Can't be that hard to fly a plane. Lots of people do it.
I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.
What?!
Back to New York for starters.
Don't make me take them away from you.
No, I'm gonna kill him --
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
If you don't eat that ice cream right now, I'm gonna strangle you until you are completely dead.
I know you're not talking to me...
Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg.
Soft and supple. Like a lady's.
What is that?
You got your own nightclub?
Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!
He's from New York City. That one, too.
We lost yesterday on accounta the rain. That means we gotta make up for it today, so put your backs to it.
Alright, listen up! I want every man lined up out here in the yard on the double! Let's move it!
That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.
Lemonade?
If you don't mind my saying, you seem mighty familiar with your house boy.
Mr. Johnson is very well connected. If you were to let us go, I guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what I mean.
What are you in for, Willie?
Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
Blacks welcome there?
You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with.
What's that, some of your bathtub brew?
I'm interested. Keep talking.
ADRIAN!
He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
Little Nicky.
Now will you get in the flask?
We could create our own hell there.
No!
I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
All these good people have totally been led astray.
Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi."
How did you see me?
Valerie's crying!
Did you just talk?
You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
Check one-two. Check one-two.
Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.
No. This can't be happening.
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
Thanks.
Boogerland!
You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
What's with that guy?
This don't look good.
No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
Good idea... kill me.
Hello.
Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
It's freezing my hands.
So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
No.
Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
What do you mean, "possessed?"
I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.
Don't do it.
Yes. What is rent?
That just hurt a lot.
Hey...
No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
That's better.  How do you want us?
How did they get in here?
What other food?
I am.
Do you have anything special in mind?
You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
What's your name?
When do you go up?
Please... no?  You mean "not here" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular.  Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you.
You prefer women?
Well then...?
Yes... probably he was renewed?
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
Later.
I'm listening.
I couldn't get you out of my mind.
Why show me?
Why tell me?
What're you going to do?
They're like beasts. Wild.
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
How do we know this is the right way?
What do you suppose this was...?
I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but --  Are you glad you didn't kill him?
I wanted to...  ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
Maybe we're the first ones to get through...  Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.
You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.
That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?
Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
And Sanctuary?
And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
Are you sure?
What kind of jewel is this?
Goodbye.
Hello, Sandman.
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
How long have you been living here?
Are there any other humans?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
Is that really it? It doesn't seem very far. Will we be there soon?
Well? How do you like it?
This rod is a fuckin', embarrassment, Carl. Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"?
You want somethin'?
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
Do you own a video camera?
How'd the camera get so high like that?
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
I want more.
Pete?
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
What's he do?
I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else...  To a girlfriend's house.  But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
You all right?
Alice...
Where's the bathroom?
Hey.
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
Please tell me.
Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
How about Madison? Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?
Now, Mack, what's the situation?
Who is it?
Yeah, Mack?
When he went to work, right.
What's the matter?
We know that.
He's not Madison?
There's no other bedroom?
What's bothering you, Madison?
What is it?
Who's it from?
It must be from a real estate agent.
I called, you know.
What's that? Another tape?
Let's go home.
Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that. 
Beautiful! Smooth as shit from a duck's ass. Let's take a ride.
You like pornos?
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
I missed you.
You want some company?
What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night.
What do you want?
Where'd you come from?
I was?
I didn't know you cared.
Sheila... Stop...
Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!
Found in Asia!
Yes, it just shows  I don't know why I'm talking to you. I don't know you. Who are you?
Left us here to rot. That's what they've done. Heroes of the newspapers!
Mr. Barnard, I do not like this place. I definitely do not like this place.
Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
The police?
That's too bad. I got a half million shares. My whole foundation! And now look at me!
They were in a quandary, and
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
You see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time.  Do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water?
Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here.
There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
And mine's Conway.
And the wine - excellent.
But Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?
Well, it must have taken
Well, they didn't actually mean that.
Very often.
Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.
Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason.
Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.
I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.
"Ungrateful fool . . . !"  Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."
Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
We were just going to bury him when you came along.
In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
You're lying, aren't you?
You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago  you're still alive, Father Perrault!
Sondra Bizet.
What's it mean?
Hello, George.  Cigarette?
I don't know.
Porters?
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things together. Where's your top coat?
I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
I knew there was a reason I hated this place. I'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you. How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth certificates?  I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world. And you, Bob Conway - two-feet-on- the-ground Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.
You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
Because you can't. Do you know what will happen to her if she leaves Shangri-La? She's a fragile thing that can only live where fragile things are loved. Take her out of this valley and she'll fade away like an echo.
The clothes?
was saying
Where were you hiding?
Good.
What do you suggest?
Was this your idea?
A man whose life was empty!
There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.
Ouch!
It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
It would serve you right if you were left behind.
Why, he's speaking English.
EXCUSE ME
You shot an eight year old girl.
The hell were you thinking?
Sir, before you boot me, I just want to explain.  I mean, okay, you got a goat-guy with a hook for a head...
Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?
So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?
...touch that.
Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
Only the damn guy won't know it.
Bull... loney- Sir.  I'm sorry.  Sir, I'm sorry. Sir.  I just, I find it hard to believe that it didn't come from you.  I mean, everything here comes from you.
Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
Helluva night, isn't it?
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
Ha ha.  No, really.
Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?
A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left.
What's going on, Kay?
Jesus Christ...
Oh, yeah?  Fill us in, why don't you.
Since how long?
Or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare.  I really like that.  Let the other girls have the guys like you. Chiseled jaw, perfect nose, quirky dimples.  I find you all so boring.
So... how'd you hear about this?
It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
What are you doing?
The kid looked desperate.  I figured...
Your licence is revoked. Permanently.
We're from Scientific American.  We read about your discovery.  We'd like to take a look.
I mean, I dunno.  I've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability.  But never like this.
We're with the immigration and Naturalization Service, Intergalactic Bureau.  We monitor all-alien activity in and around Earth and its enveloping atmosphere.
What?
I can't.  I have to know.
Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street.  The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
Where are we going?
I have to go back.
She's not alive, but she didn't die.
Why?
From where?  D.C.?
I'm setting up a timer.  When it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here.  But not before then, or you'll --
That's an old one.  One of our first.
Hence the expression...
And you say the third prevision was, what, a little fuzzy or something?
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
You understand, John, that the minute Precrime goes national, they're going to take it away from us.
I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
John.  Please.  Listen to me --
Uh, sir...
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
Okay, Jad, what's coming?
We need confirmation on the time frame.  Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
Somewhere near the capital?
Look at the kid.  In this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit.
What?
You guys are nodding your heads like you actually know what the hell he's talking about.
I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
Sorry.  Old habit.  I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.  My father was a minister.  Lutheran.
She was looking right at me.
Wally, listen to me...
I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
She's a precog?
Sean -- you're not real.
What the hell.
Who are you?
Do you know who I am?
Something wrong?
You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
Insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
Sir, the press conference is starting.
You have an emergency call on your private line.
Lamar, I found something.
By fooling the system.  All someone would have to do is wait for Precrime to stop the murder from taking place, then, a few minutes later, commit the crime in exactly the same way.
So there is a way to fool the system?
This is Evanna, the team pilot.
Can't they shut that off?
The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
Because of the nature of murder.  "There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another".
Sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.
If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
What about your meeting?
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
This your work?
You know I need to use you.
They've never been separated before.
What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
Wally, the other two can still function, right?
Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
Thank you very much, sir.
What, sir?
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.
Women?
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part... Okay...
It's a poison arrow tree frog.
I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone.
No. What kind of bachelor party?
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.
Max offered to stake me.
She needs a family. A dad. I'll give her what you never had.
Well, you look it. You win?
What's your record at?
Yeah.
So, when's the drop.
So what do we do?
Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?
How so?
Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.
I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...
Yes.
'Dis?' 'Dis?' You're not in a position to 'dis', or 'give props', or whatever your Real World sense of fucking decorum tells you to do. You're nothing. You're wallpaper. You're not here to make fucking friends. Asking a motherfucker where he lives. And who the fuck told you 'Red Dragon'?.
Spa?
We're with Ruiz.
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
Can you check?
Sorry, man, but...
Any time, bro.
How am I being shitty?
Cause if you don't know the number, I can page you with the number so you'll have the number.
I think we might.
Shit. Who we kidding? I know I suck, and I held you up for ten rounds --
I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
How'd you unlock my phone?
Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's.
I don't know.
You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here.
'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
How much was it?
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
Nothing else.
How'd they know who you were?
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
You fucking nuts?
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
What the fuck's going on?
What the fuck was that about?
You did?
What about it?
Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
You want to come splash around.
It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
How much is what?
Excuse me.
I operate out of the Chicago O'Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else?
Where's Spa.
How do you know it's not drugs?
You strapped?
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
Stop.
I'm half Irish.
And where is...?
Yeah.
Good morning.
Is it nice?
A lot of Persians?
Nigger, please. Don't even order that artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks, Leo. We gotta roll. What do I owe you?
Can I borrow a piece of --
I get it.
I never intended to test you two to that extent, but you both came through. I should've been informed there was a flag on the play, but I'll take that up with Ruiz. I made a few calls back East. Those punks weren't tied in with anyone. As for the Welshman, he wasn't in on it. He was just plain dumb. As for you, Ricky, your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van.
We're square.
We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything.
What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?
When all this is over and we're not working for Maxie, I'd love to run into you on the street.  Why aren't you coming?
Edinburgh.
Scotland.
I am.
Dip?
Sit down. We ain't fixing to eat you. You look brand new in town. Pretty handy with a bottle.
What they call you?
Where can I get a hold of you?
Did you just now con me?
How's it feel?
1, 2, 8; 2, 8, 1.  I git 'em all?
Shit, what else she gonna say?
It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
I'm wearing, Archie.
You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.
Man live by his rep.
The dirty yellow rat bastard.
Who the hell are you?
You ain't lying.
Why? Why does everybody conk?
Leggo. I got to wash it out.
Don't con me.
I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.
What? Everybody knows God is White.
Little.
I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.
I don't know how.
Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our loudspeaker is heard on the street?
Folks are sitting out there today, not next week, expecting to hear our program.
Could we sit down someplace?
You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. Tell me something: how tall are you?
Why are you looking at me like that?
"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."
I'm sorry. I haven't been the best husband or father.
I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray.
As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
Let him finish.
Are you Elijah's pimp?
I thought you said we were going to the movies last night.
'Bout every other night, Red.
The average first offender gets two years for burglary. We were all first offenders. That's what Sophia and Peg drew --
'Lo. I've got to freshen up.
I mean it's late, baby.
Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
Another one?
You're my father.
That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't run.
You like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie?
Sweetie, they're almost ready.
Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby?
That ain't bad.
What did you do, Homey, palm it?
Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
You want to be the head man?
Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him.
It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.
It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The religion of La Hermanidad. There's a curse on you.
What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
Where does he live?
[Daniel.]
[Who pays you?]
[What's the PIN number?]
[She's late, Mr. Creasy.]
[Yeah.  Yes.]
[What do you mean?]
[The girl's. Pinta's.]
Is it loaded?
I'm here.
Where are you from, Creasy?
No.
No.
Did you like school, Creasy?
So you were unhappy?
I don't think they're broken. Anywhere else?
Do you always sleep with him?
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.
You think too much?
Then be trained.
Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you have everything you need.
It makes it all seem so serious.
Jordan!
The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
Good news. You're going back to school.
Yes, mom?
I think it's nice he's American.
She likes him.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
[A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a 9 year old. The bodyguard's American. Not only that he's black.]
[Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday.]
[Who's that?]
Tell me about your friend Creasy.
Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
Hey, Herbie...
You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
So waddaya feel like doing tonight?
Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?
Marty, your mother wants you onna phone.
We gotta postcard from my son Nickie and his bride. They're inna big hotel in Florida on their honeymoon. Everything is very nice.
I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!"
That's my son Thomas's baby.
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
You will see. A coupla months, you gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law's house.
I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.
You gotta real nice face, you know? It's really a nice face.
So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.
Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter. Because she's always writing them to come out there. So it's a nice little shop. I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. The point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. There's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an A&P coming in, at least that's the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade is strictly Italian, but the younger Italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old Italian dishes so much. I mean, you gotta take that into account too.
It's only a quarter of twelve. The clock's right over there.
I think you're kidding yourself, Clara. I used to think about moving out, you know? And that's what I used to say. "My mother needs me." But when you really get down to it, that ain't it at all. Actually, you need your father. You know what I mean? You're living at home, and you got your father and mother there, and you can go on like that -- being a little girl all your life.
No, Marty, please...
Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.
It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. Pilletti. I hope I'll see you again.
You say something?
Are you kidding?
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
She was always a bit thin in the hips...
Oh, that's a sad story. And her husband is that little fellow, works in Peter Reeves.
All right, I'll see you, Thomas, because he wants an answer by Monday.
Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because I promised Mr. Gazzara I'd let him know tomorrow. See, what I wanna know, Tom, if a buncha individual retail merchants get together, how does it operate? On individual mark- ups? You know what I mean? Say I'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli, he's the dairyman and grocer, so suppose I mark up thirty-five percent, but he works on forty, so...
Well, I understand the problem about the supermarkets, but I was talking to this girl last night, and she made the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business asset.
Hello, Ma.
Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
Hello, Marty, when you come home?
She's more than twenty-nine years old, Marty. That's what she tells you.
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
No, that's my sister Margaret's husband, Frank. My sister Margaret, she's married to the insurance salesman, and my sister Rose, she married a contractor. They moved to Detroit last year. And my other sister Frances, she got married about two and a half years ago in Saint John's Church on Kingsbridge Avenue. Oh, that was a big affair. Well, let's see now, that'll be about a dollar- seventy-nine. How's that with you?
I just wanna thank you people again, because the situation was just becoming impossible.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
He coming home right now.
Well...
No, Virginia, I know how you feel.
I'm sorry we gotta rush like this...
Marty, I don't know how to tell you how much I appreciate what you and your mother are doing, because the kinda thing was happening in our house was Virginia was in the kitchen making some milk for the baby. So my mother comes in...
Don't you think I feel lousy about this too?
What about the time she wanted to make an old-fashioned Italian dinner for my brother, but you wouldn't let her!?
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
There's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention.
We wanted to tell you how you were helping us with your fixes.
What do you want me to do?
What do I do with it Hawk? This is a little out of my line.
Y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the Army sent.
Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying.
Yes, O'Reilly?
You boys'll have to go to work early.
I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
Where?
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
Don't you use olives?
She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?
Y'all mind the store.
Because is not democrash? All peoples created equal?
I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
So long, Ho-Jon.
You got directions?
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
This kid looks like a loser. Maybe we better get the bead-jiggler to put in a fix.
And you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. Right? Does that mean...?
I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
Any time. Whenever we want.
I thought we were heading for trouble putting on all these trinkets.
But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul.
Ravenous. What about you?
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
Is that liquor?
I was just asking...
Gimme three.
Pierce! That soldier requires immediate attention. I'm a surgeon and I know.
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
Well, it's still pretty much in the talk stage.
I think I heard about that.
Radar!
I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home.
Black capsule.
It's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and doesn't have to take any time outs.
If we squeeze him through, I'm going to get him into Androscoggin College.
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
Thank you, Captain Pierce.  It's been so long.
How did you get called that?
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
Even if I weren't.
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
They missed the boat.
He's the pro from Dover and I'm the Ghost of Smokey Joe.
What's the story?
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
That's really what I came here for. See what you guys recommend.
How much time do I have?
I have not understood what you means.
Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.
You don't aim to cause any trouble  But?
About that chest-cutter...
I should fire him because he got in the way of Trapper's fist? No. I've put up with a lot from you guys, but now I finally have to take disciplinary action.
It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.
What's wrong with you?
Splendid, sir. No problems.
Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
Never mind.
We don't have to see him. Call that halfassed Army hospital and tell them to be ready to put some lipiodol in this kid's esophagus and take X- rays.
How is he?
As long as there's a pile-up, we can do our bit to encourage his permanent withdrawal from the contest.
Action?
Here. Sit down!  Quiet, egghead!  All right, now, a serious expression.
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
Against anything. Just protest.
Oh. Yeah.
Say, he's a friend of mine.
Uh-huh . . .
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
You know, I had a crazy dream last night. It was about you.
Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
Go ahead, driver! Ball park!
. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?
Money?  Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?
Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.
Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
Look. We can't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. Good night!  No telling what that screwball might do. I walked in yesterdayhere he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!
Now listen, Annhe can't possibly get in without our seeing him. I'm watching the side door and the Colonel's out front, so stop worrying.
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
No sense in going up there! I been here for hours. He ain't here!
Baseball?
Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that?
Who's got him?
Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?
Ba-ll!
No!
Jitterbugs.[9] Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL.
No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.
Listen, palthis fifth column stuff's pretty rotten, isn't it?[11]
Go down to the office and arrange for some radio time.
I want it as soon as possible.
How about family? Got any family?
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
What difference does that make?
I bet you he'd know how to say it all right. And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!
Racket? What do you mean?
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
Say, who's putting up this dough?
Spencer of the Chronicle .
A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it? 
I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
Where's the stereo?
What happened? Is there a problem?
God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now.
I won't get away with it.
This has nothing to do with Walter.
Manual or automatic?
Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.
We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
You don't have to come here.
For now that's all.
You can't kill me like this.
I'm impressed. I didn't think you could do it. What did you have to do, steal them?
How do you feel after a shooting.
What's the point of this?
You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
Come on. Let's go for a drink.
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage.
Tell me what you need.
Yes.
What did you see?
Ronnie... Yeah, so.
They need to run first and second?
See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty.
He's got the girl.
And what if you can't live with it?
That's a chance I gotta take.
Have you evacuated anyone?
Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything.
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
This baseball player you're going out with...  He's no good for you.
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else.
Please. I'm begging you.
Maybe you should be.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
I wanted to get this out of the way.
That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much?
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
When?
How's Paco doing?
How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy.
Stay up there, Girl...
What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
Repoed this morning.
The chief says to tell you how sorry he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a good man.
What do we got?
What do you want?
It's okay.
Why --
As long as it's not 'what's your sign?'
That's a strange question.  You a strange man?
You were right.
Who are you?!
You don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?
It's time to wake up.
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
The new world.
Unlimited energy out there.  Enough to run this world for all eternity --
Until you're on the net where the corporation can't touch you, you can't open the system.  They'll eject it if you do.
Remember, I'm not the one who chose this.
Two maze runners.
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
Try harder.
One condition.
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
Then you had her killed.
Someone you have to get back to?
But I don't know anything about programming.
Why?
What?
Care to tell us how you came into possession of an illegal access program?
Why not?
Program name?
Transmit copy of program via satellite north uplink.
Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.
Select uplink for Federal Communications Office.  Department of Enforcement.
We've got him locked!
WE CAN'T BREAK FREE!
Alpha.  Is there any way we can defeat this  monster?  Any way at all?
He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart and bold.
... What's happening to him?'
I can hardly walk...
We've come all this way for a rock wall?!
Let's teach these vermin a few manners.
In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove.
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
It is said that once you've reached the power... you have only ten triacs to release it.
You okay?
I am the wolf, cunning and swift!
NINJA CRANE ZORD!
All systems go!
... Nothing.
I'm in!
IMPACT IN FIFTEEN SECONDS!
Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.
SKULL!!
We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place.
What!
I hope those Rangers put that lousy lowlife out of his misery!
Anybody see them?
We're asking you to go to prison.
One fuckin' year ago I had ta hit you up for train fare. Now I can buy the fuckin' train. And I ain't even a fuckin' Sicilian!
You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
I remember reading a poem in college. "Sicily. Poor, noble isle...".
The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.
Are you frightened?
I ain't mad. I ain't even surprised. But I can't let ya fuck me. On the other hand, if ya got needs beyond the thirty-five, I'll advance it to you against our next deal on the same terms.
When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal.
Shane was a friend of yours?
Bastard didn't even show.
A hundred-seven bucks too much. Any kid who drops an extra dime is gonna be talkin' to Moliari.
Luciano.
I booked passage to London.
I'm gonna lose you, Charlie.
Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?
Julius Caesar never took no vote.
We'll figure out something.
Your honeymoon, Meyer?
You're getting' 10 cc's
You bastards, I said twenty!
Tommy Reina's gone over to Maranzano, but so far Masseria ain't lifted a finger,
Yeah. So who the fuck does?
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
Don Maranzano. Welcome.
Then perhaps you need to know me.
Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you.
And how many soldiers do you have?
He's an animal!
We combine everything. You are my second in command.
At first, it will hurt you. But you will come to understand and we will be strong together.
We must be friends, Charlie.
Forget it. That's past.
Wanna know what I think?
Those fucks can't leave each other alone. Maranzano and Masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
Maranzano wants you dead.
I'm a hard guy. I done more jobs than alla you combined. And I never said no. Not once. But dammit I don't understand why the hell we gotta kill our friends!
The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.
I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
What's the matter?
Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get <u>People</u> and <u>Entertainment Tonight</u> to cover it.
You're really gonna pop the question?
Holy shit.
Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?
Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a <u>putz</u> - and I should know. I'm his little brother.
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
Bitchin' good cake.
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
Stu?
How was it? I don't recall.
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a -
Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.
Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
Well, when I walked up the block, I ... well, my word!
You know ...  ... whoops!
Well, they were right out in plain view.
You know, you never tell me anything.
Oh, that has nothing to do with it.
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
Mother!
Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
Who is it?
And there was this number on my phone bill that I didn't recognize.  Calls made at three and four in the morning.  So, I called the number ... and a woman answered.  And I ... I hung up.  So, then I followed him.  Just like in the movies.  And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn.  We had been going together for almost a year.
You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single.
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
I see.  How much?
Forty-five?  I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
--what possible explanation can you offer for this charge being--as you say--"trumped up" against you!
But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and--?
How do you *like* this! You don't suppose that ranger met up with some kids--and took 'em for a hike!
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
Sit tight, Diz. The show commences in just a minute.
You play--left field.
Oh--yeah--
Now, look, kid--if we're gonna wonder, let's go down and do it over a hunk of steak.  Come on, snap out of it. Diz Moore-- that rarest of companions--is here at your side.  To genteel crime, kid.
Every time I think of it, I get a laugh, Diz.
And I got him all dressed up, too-- to go way up in a balloon--so they can drop him a long way--make sure they break his heart. Why, not all the Boy Rangers in the world, working night shifts, 'll be able to put Humpty-Dumpty together again--
Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take--  Say--who started this?
*All right*, then. After all, what's it to me? So they *drop* him out of a balloon. All I care is--I don't want to be around. See? Squeamish. See? That's what I am. No, sir. I don't have to take it. Won't be a party to no murder. I'm gonna quit. I'm through.
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
My first name's--Clarissa.
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir.
You know, we're getting married.
The war's on!
That infernal phone!
Sam Foley--dead!
Taylor, my dear.
Really, my dear--I don't feel like a thing.
I do *not* want a Senator. And I do *not* want any more of this nonsense! Emma!
Are you ready for him, Bill?
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--
Now--now--please--that's quite all right. Relax, boys--
What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?
Jeff for Senator.
I *thought* I heard... Yes?
A pet shop?
When Jeff gets through with Taylor, Pop--
Washington!
Just a minute, I better make sure.
Here they are--I got them. They are all right.
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
I mean, sir--if I'm going to stay in the Senate--I ought to know what I'm doing--at least, I ought to try to study the Bills that are coming up--
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
I'm sorry! Gee! I hope--
--I may not know much about a lot of things, sir--but I know that Willet Creek country like a book--and--and I tell you, Senator Paine--there's something *wrong* about this dam-- why, there isn't a foot of water in that creek--it's dry four months out of the--
Now, now, now--that isn't going to get you any place. Get a firm grip, Ma!
What is it?
Gee--I'm sorry about that, Miss--you *are* Miss Saunders, aren't you?
Gee, I'm sorry. You see, it wasn't until I was fairly well along in the bus that I realized--
--big as life--sparkling away there under the sun. I--I started walking toward it--and there was a bus outside-- and--well--I--I just naturally got aboard--
Now, if you're ready, Senator, we can start for the hotel. I'll *see* that you get there.
Whose statue is that?
Pardon me. Senator Paine decided this *with* you?
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--!
Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--
Committee.
Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get?
Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
On paper?
Well--gosh--that--that isn't "particulars," is it?
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
Abigail.
Letitia.
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go--
You couldn't. You've never been out there, you said.
Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here?
I--I--gee whiz--I didn't thank you!
It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over, this way.
I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*! 
What you *have* to do is fight!
Tell us about yourself, Senator! Hear you got a Boy's Club back home! Any ideas? Going to make things hum in the Senate, huh?
Whoa! Hold it! Pipe down! Come on, now--that's enough of that.
Just for the fun of it.--You see the one that makes it back home in the fastest time, I am going to enter in the nationals.
Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.
However, Senator Smith is still a member of this Body and as such has equal claim on the attention of the Chair--
Uh--Mr. President--you and I are about to be alone in here, sir. I'm not complaining for social reasons, but it'd be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this.  Mr. President--I call the chair's attention to Rule Five of the Standing Rules of the Senate Section Three. "If it shall be found that a quorum is not present, a majority of the Senators present--," and that begins to look like me--"may direct the Sergeant-at-arms to request, and if necessary *compel* the attendance of the absent Senators."  Mr. President--*I so direct*.
One moment, friends, let's give the Senator a break.  Now, where'd you say you studied law?
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
Chick--
Joe--drop everything and come with me!
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
Yeah?  And what else?
Why don't you do it yourself?
Every word that boy said is the truth! I'm not fit for office! I'm not fit for any place of honor or trust in this land! Expel me--!
Joe, that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street.
We can't drop it now, Joe. We bought the land around this Dam and we're holding it in dummy names. If we drop it or delay it--we are going to bring about investigations, and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the State under phoney names. No, Joe, in my judgment the only thing to do is push this Dam through--and get it over with.
Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home.
Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
Well, what do you want me to do? Stand around like you chump and let that drooling infant wrap that Willet Creek Dam appropriation around my neck. Either he falls in line with us and behaves himself or I'll break him so wide open they'll never be able to find the pieces.
Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years, Joe, since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator, and now you can't stand it. Well, maybe you won't have to stand it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together.
It's in your lap, Joe. Keep an eye on him. If he gets to his feet and says anything--
Hey--Joe! Where you going? We've got to celebrate tonight!
Here, here, Susan--this is Jeff Smith-- our new Senator.
Do I actually *see* this--?
Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?
No. Don't ever want to go out without telling us.
Pixilated.
He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
Oh, yes.
You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
Were you present when all these things took place?
You fainted.
Feel better now?
Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.
There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together.
I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.
What did you mean by that?
Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
He played in the town band, too.
Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
Oh, I suppose you could do better.
Ready?
The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you.
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.
Good night.
You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?
The guy's balmy.
Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?
He's the original. There are no carbon copies of that one.
What's bothering you, huh?
That's the rub.
This is for you , Mac. The names of all the headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices.
It's for you. In a couple weeks you'll get the itch so bad, you'll be working for nothing.
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
Ow! My foot's asleep!
The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. They're getting a trifle impatient, sir.
Who? Miss Dawson?
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
How is this, sir?
I wish you luck, sir.
He's not home, I tell you!
Nuisance value?
I can't find him.
Look!
Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
Yes. That is to say
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
Thanks  Oh, did you send that telegram to Jim Mason?
You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."[2]
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
But what about this "Cinderella Man"?
Just as I suspected, wise guy! I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.
She's the star reporter on The Mail. Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "Cinderella Man." You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
What about your knocking off for lunch?
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
The wrong kind! There isn't any wrong or right kind. Opera is opera!
Now, where were we?
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
Mrs. Semple?
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Those opera people are funny. They wanted me to put up $180,000.
Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr. Deeds.
You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.
No - I don't want it, thank you.
Yes. Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
Look, he's temperamental.
Proceed.
No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married
You're Mabel - her sister - aren't you?
No, sir.
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
Oh. Oh!  Has Miss Dawson called yet?
Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
Hey, did you hear that?
Why, that's an echo, sir!
Me, sir?
Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3
Why are they ganging up against me?
I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it --
Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. First time in a long time she's been willing.
We're interested in any new therapies. How would you characterize your approach?
...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.
What's that?
Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all --
I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
No?
I feel like we're making real progress here.
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc?
You're the doctor, what do you think?
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
That's a lot of people all at once.
You do?
How long you been in this town?
You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so.  Nice car. How's that place?
It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard.  Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
...so rich?
Doc...
Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
What it might take is... doing time.
...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district --
Hello, Lionel.
But you know how to drive?
I just got my license two weeks ago.
Hiya, Doc.
How are you?
Hello, Mother. I want you to meet Dr. Mumford.
Just who is here, can you tell me?
Feel free to lie down. Most people do.
No.
Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
Even if you don't think it's real?
I don't know. I barely made it today.
We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it.
I've offended you!
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
You're doing great.
That was really bad, wasn't it?
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
My brother said you were about to fire me.
Is it something you've heard about me?
I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
Mother...
...How violated I feel?
Will you think about it?
Oh.
We're only talking about six weeks.
Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff?
The school board doesn't pay you? What kind of deal is that?
Fuck the community.  There was this article my friends and I read. It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed". It was very fascinating.
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
What are you talking about?
You're Doc Mumford.  Skip Skipperton.
Can I ask you a personal question?
I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
Hey, Skip.
Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --
And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret?
Damn! What is your name?
Did you carry a gun?
But look at me now...
Somebody's taking a shower down there.
I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.
But you studied psychology, right? You did the training and just never got the degree?
Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess.
How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways?
Altar boys?
You never were any good with the ladies, O'Connell.
Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good.
Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy?
Yeah?
It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
The sun turning black.
You bastards!
The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here.
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."
You know your history.
We're almost there.
For what?
According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
You two!
Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew.
I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.
That's what I am to you? A contract?
I'm staying.
You called me your girl?
Got it!
Got guts, lady.
You...! YOU...!
Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours.
You lied to me!
But he's just a filthy criminal?
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.
Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
I knew you'd come. I left that skylight open for you.
And what's that?
It must have slipped my mind.
Where are you going?
You two timing psychotic bastard.
We didn't think this through very well.
Atta, girl!
Who are you?
I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine. Law.
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
How's your dad?
He'll never make it.
But times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. I can see you still got the style, but I dunno for sure you still got the edge.
Superheroes.
What did you do with Captain Amazing?
They always call the great ones nuts.
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
Come here.
Who?
Or talk?
What's your real name?
Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
It's me.
I'm going inside.
Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil.
Oh don't start that again --
What are you talking about?
You sure that's how you spell it?
There's a big difference.
He doesn't miss a trick, does he?
Why not?
Let's go.
Agents?
Maybe there was traffic.
But... only when no one is looking.
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
Jeffrey!
It is?
Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
Hi.
This is bad.
To us!
We're outnumbered twenty to one.
It's time.
Where am I going?
My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.
I have heard that story but I do not believe it.
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
About 5,000 troops.
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
And where is the army?
But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?
I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position.
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
Josephine dead -- how unbelievable! How impossible it is to believe it. She was always physically so strong -- she was never ill a day in her life.
But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
Read it back.
General Bonaparte?
Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.
Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
Yes, sir?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
My God...!  What time is it?
But to start a fire like this in five hours -- how is it possible? It would take a carefully organized plan, tons of combustibles and hundreds of people.
And he sent you to me?
The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
When is she supposed to return?
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
Ah, that is good.
Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais.  I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon.
And you, are you in love with any one else?
Were you in love with any of them?
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working.
How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
Separate bedrooms?
But you will not... be safe...
I believe you sent for me.
God damn it, Junot, wouldn't you think I have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to Joseph?
Why did you give it to him?
Nothing.  That's all I can say.
What was there to tell?
Do you know what you're saying?
I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.
Can you give me a drink, please?
Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
And, where did you see my portrait?
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
Those are extremely harsh terms.
Has Alexander agreed to this?
Now, the section headed "Secret Clauses of the Treaty" -- Article 14b, provides for Alexander to serve as mediator between France and England and, if he fails to achieve a preliminary agreement within four months, it further provides that Russia is to go to war against England, and close her ports to English trade.
Come in.
That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either.
Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?
I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember.
Stretch it out.
We didn't come here for Day-Day.
Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here?
Where you going?
For sure.  That's how I like 'em.
Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend.
Naw, I already ate.
Shut up.  I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin.  They're right there in the back.
It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow.
I ain't trying to get in it.
You see that?
Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's.
You sure you don't wanna stay?
I will.  When can I come visit?
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
Hello, remember me?
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
Delivery!
Here I come!
What's the matter?
Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't smell nothing.
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
No, give me my damn money back.  Right now, and I don't have no damn receipt neither.
That the big one, huh?
I gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow.
I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.
Hey.
Money?  Man, we came over here from some sugar and rolling papers.  We was going to get high, and I was going to show this white boy how to make Kool-Aid.  That's all.
Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar?
Here's the plan.  You gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for Mr. William Jones.
I thought you were taking me to see Mama?
Need to lose some weight.
Well, we better hit the road, too. Craig, get your stuff.
Where to, sir?
'S okay. What do you think?
Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
You were saying?  Your daughter....?
I have a problem.
Good luck.
Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!
I will do no such thing.
Look at your watch. Look at it! At one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!
How am I supposed to get away?
One thirty. California Ballroom.
I talk to her or you can forget about it.
Are you sure?
Can we go now?
You got anything smaller?
It's a twenty.
Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
Please. Something is going to happen...
There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
Keep the change.
Meet Irene.
Thanks for the shine.
You stole that.
He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.
You have, huh?
Close your eyes.
Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em.
You don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all.
And what happens if I don't call you?
God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Only you can help her.
That's enough.
You understand?
'Twas down at Cresap's Landing, Along the River Shore, Birdie Steptoe was a Pilot in the good old days of yore. Now he sets in his old wharf-boat...
Do you mind me cussin', boy?
I'll light the lamp.
And when little King Jesus' Ma and Pa heard about that plan, what do you reckon they went and done?
Yes! Yes!
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
About Mr. Powell. All of it!
Dear Walt and Icey: I bet you been worried and gave us up for lost. Took the kids down here with me for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm. Thot a little change of scenery would do us all a world of good after so much trubble and heartache. At least the kids will git a plenty of good home cooking. Your devoted Harry Powell
Lynch him! Lynch him!
Draggin' the name of the Lord through the evil mud of his soul!
He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
That boy's as stubborn and mulish as a sheep!
I burned it.  I tore it up and burned it -- it stank so strong of hellfire.
You'll get awful mad, John. I done a Sin!
To see Dad?
I'm hungry, John.
Where ye from?
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
All right boy: where's the money?
Nothin'. 
Now it's your turn.
How old are you?
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
O no! Your turn!
John's bad.
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
What do you figure to do?
That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
John: take that look offen your face and act nice.
You thought, Willa, that the moment you walked in that door I'd start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night. Ain't that right, now?
Get up, Willa.
Them kids is yours?
Pearl and John!
Miz Cooper!
Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.
It's just a stupid cat.
You okay?
Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street.
Guess I did.
You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
What happens if they don't do that?
'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
Hello?
Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is.
The killer.
Me!? Why would anyone want to kill me?!
Me?  Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!
She dreamed this would happen...
Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.
Sure, okay, I'll be there. Now you just turn in and get some rest, sweetheart. Please. Deal?
What's the Coroner got to say?
Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
Tell her I'm not here, tell her...
Apparently he was crazy jealous. Nancy said they'd had a fight, Rod and Tina.
Right home after.
And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
Bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go. Found him in an old boiler room, just like before. Saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side...
Give me the key, mother.
Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?
The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.
And then what happened?
How could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it?
Do you think I did it?
Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep. Couldn't get back to sleep at all.  So what you dream?
Thank you, Comrade.
From Leon.
I'll tell you later.  That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
You must help us, Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia!
And the surprise is there's nothing in it.
He's cutting our throat...
We don't like Razinin.
We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look...  The service in this hotel is terrible!  See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.
Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.
We are not only serving good food, we are serving our country... we are making friends.
Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?
About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
Your breakfast, monsieur.
And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something.
Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon.
We can wait.
We can call our ambassador.
Halt negotiations immediately. Envoy extraordinary arrives Thursday six ten with full power. Your authority cancelled herewith. Razinin.
We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
...des petites fraises des bois... de la crme de Bretagne... 
What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade?
Comrade Kopalski...
A week?
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.
Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.
This is Comrade Kopalski.
Now, monsieur, you have no right...
If we had known we would have greeted you with flowers.
Allow me, Comrade.
What's that?
How are you, you three scoundrels?
The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good.
I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...
You want me to go in there?
What for... why?
At what intervals does he whistle?
Can I help you?
Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
Yes, it is.
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
Is that customary?
You are something we do not have in Russia.
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
Don't do it, please.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
Glorious, analytical...
Let's forget that we ever met.
I was sent here by my country to fight you.
At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
Because we are an odd couple.
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?
No... go on.
Leon, I would like to ask you something.
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
Go on.
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
No speech.
Would that make you any happier?
I have paid the penalty. Now let's have some music.
It's dead.
Come, sweetheart. Let me put it on you. You will teach these jewels. For the first time they will learn how they can look.
Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.
It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves.
Did you win?
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
Leon! What in heaven's name...!
Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
Make it ice cold.
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
Yes, Swana, you did.
Yes, Swana.
There's a charming crowd here tonight, isn't there?
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
How stale last night's gaiety looks! It has the taste of a dead cigarette.
My palace in Petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I had...  but nothing more -- I warn you.
Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
I wouldn't waken Leon. After last night I would say not before three o'clock at the earliest.
Here, please...
May I have your bags, madame?
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
It's just a place for workmen.
Sir, if I may ... echo my concern ...
He told me to take you to his conference room.
Hunt has nothing to lose now.  Pardon all of them.  Nobody's going to investigate a crime for which the criminals have already been pardoned.
How much do you need?
I'm still not confident we can ride through this.  Some people are going to have to go to jail.  Hunt's not the only problem.  Haldeman let me use the $350,000 cash fund in his safe to make the payments.  Ehrlichman had a role, a big role, in the Ellsberg break-in. And I'm ... uh, I think it's time we begin to think in terms of cutting our losses.
I'm not going to be the scapegoat for this.  Haldeman and Ehrlichman are in just as deep as me.
Sure, they did stuff, but nothing like this, Bob.  Forget Watergate, the break-ins, the Enemies list.  You got an attempted firebombing at the Brookings Institution, planting McGovern stuff on the guy that shot Wallace, trying to slip LSD to Jack Anderson.
Goddamn! How long have we had this fucking dog?!  Two years, he still doesn't come!  We need a dog that looks happy when the press is around.
I like it.  I like the idea.
And?
This is not a joke, John!
The soldiers were provoked.  The students started it, for Christ's sake!
He's in the dumps, sir.  Agnew.  Every time you have him attack the press, they give it back to him in spades. He's become the most hated man in America.
No, you didn't, Bob.
I would personally enjoy doing that, sir.
I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit!  You know who's behind this, don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president.
No, you're not!  You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment.  I don't give a shit.  They can't force the President's people to testify.
This is June twentieth?
... Y'know Al, if Hoover was alive none of this would've happened.  He would've protected the President.
Richardson won't do that.  He'll resign.
Sir, the deadline is today.
Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper.  You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation.
On the list of horribles, I know what he is.  And I know what he tracks back to.  You say he was involved in the Plumbers?
I did?
Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys?  Or maybe Chotiner?
Play it tough.  That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it.  Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it.  Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.  Tell Helms he should call the FBI, call Pat Gray, and say that we wish for the sake of the country -- don't go any further into this hanky-panky, period!
Christ, you're right -- Gray makes Jerry Ford look like Mozart.  Just have Helms call him.  Helms can scare anybody.
No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do.
Meanwhile, what happens to the country?
Cue the crowd.  Go to the woman's group.  Get the bald guy, he's great ...
He wasn't protecting me.  He was putting me on notice.
If they didn't tell Kennedy about Track 2, how did Hoover find out?
... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?
She got it, Bob.  A nineteen-year-old college kid ...
So that explains his press notices. Working both sides of the fence: Jewboy Henry, always trying to get his Nobel Prize, get laid ...
You know why they're turning on me? They're not serious about power, that's why.  They're playing with power.  They're forgetting the national interest.  In the old days, people knew how to hold power, how to set limits.  They wouldn't have torn this country apart over a third-rate burglary. All they care about now are their egos, looking good at cocktail parties ...
I promised Iran to Townsend.
Helms wants Iran or there might be problems.  All of his old CIA buddies are over there making a fortune off the Shah.
President Kennedy threatened to smash the CIA into a thousand pieces.  You could do the same ...
And of course I accept.  I'm flattered.  And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time.
It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.
Are you tapping Kissinger?
By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize?
I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.
Ummm...
Roselli?  Johnny Roselli?
You'll win the nomination.
We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.
Who do you think is behind it?
This damned tie ... Will you help me, Edgar?  Churchill used to say to me, "If you want your own history written properly, you must write it yourself."  All right, Edgar, but just don't let it come back to haunt me.
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
I know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a Republican, and she'd do anything for the Party.
By the way, Jack, this looks like a pretty straight-forward transaction to me, but we should get into it soon -- just take a few minutes, maybe up at the house ...
Gentlemen, I tried.  I told Kennedy to go into Cuba.  He heard me and he made his decision.  I appreciate your sentiments.  I've heard them from many fine Cuban patriots, but it's nothing I can do anything about.  Now, it's a long drive back to Dallas tonight, and Trini and I have got an early flight tomorrow to New York ...
And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ...
Desi's got a point.  What the hell are we gonna do about the Communists right here in our backyard?!
... And now I have a federal judge ordering me to bus my kids halfway 'cross town to go to school with some nigger kids. I think, Mr. President, you're forgetting who put you where you are.
No, Henry.  I don't.
This will get me a second term.  Damn it, without risk, there's no heroism. There's no history.  I, Nixon, was born to do this.
You'll pick up the middle on this one - the Jews and Negros.
Yes, you always had a good sense of timing, Henry.  When to give and when to take. How do you think Mao, Brezhnev will react?  Do you think this is how they'll remember me, Henry, after all the great things you and I did together? As some kind of ... of ... crooks?
Secret, Mr. Chairman?
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
We let you down, didn't we.  Your people.
I must say you look very good, Mr. Chairman.
Don't ever trust them.  They never tell the truth or honor their commitments.  Vietnamese are like Russians.  Both are dogs.
What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile?  You gonna send Kissinger down there?
Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
This isn't '48, Dick.  They'll never buy it.
... give me a break, Mary.
But it was all we had.
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
Come on, man -- Vietnam ain't Germany. It doesn't threaten us.  It's a civil war between the Vietnamese.
That's Julie ... and that's Tricia. She, uh, reminds me a little bit of you ...
... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like?  I mean, what kind of clothes do you like?  Do you like blue ... red?
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
No, we don't!  You're full of shit! You say you want to end the war, so why don't you?  My brother died over there last November.  Why?  What good was his death?
Someone wants it ...  You can't stop it, can you?  Even if you wanted to.  Because it's not you. It's the system.  And the system won't let you stop it ...
No, they want you, Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move.
We lost ...
What are you saying?  What are you talking about?
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
You don't have to go.
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
Yes ... you know it!  Yes ... I will. Yeah!
Are you okay?
Yes!  This is about me.  Why can't you understand that, you of all people? It's not the war -- it's Nixon!  They want to destroy Nixon!  And if I expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out.  Do you want that?  Do you want to see that, Buddy?  It's not pretty.
What exactly did you want to discuss, Pat?
And what would I find out that I haven't known for years.  What makes it so damn sad is that you couldn't confide in any of us. You had to make a record ... for the whole world.
It'll be over soon.
Oh, Happy!  Dick Nixon ... You remember him.
Won or lost?
"Checkers" of course, Hiss, Ike's heart attack, Venezuela, the Kitchen Debate, and Kennedy.
You heard it?
But -- how'd you know it was mine?
I am older.
...I always thought when I got older God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I'd have the same opinion about me that he does.
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
That's the boy.
...How come do you reckon the coyotes ain't been at 'em?
We goin' in?
What about yours?
...Now that's aggravating.
Yessir.
Yessir. It was punched out.
You gonna drive out there?
No.
I wouldn't worry about it.
I knowed you was crazy when I saw you settin' there. I knowed exactly what was in store for me.
Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.
What're you doin', baby?
...If I don't come back tell Mother I love her.
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
Why all the way to Del Rio?
What should I do?
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
I know where the money is.
You don't know to a certainty. Twenty minutes it could be here.
What's this about?
...Where's the transponder?
What airport would you use.
I don't know.
You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?
Yes, I do. I think you do too. So this is what I'll offer. You bring me the money and I'll let her go. Otherwise she's accountable. The same as you. That's the best deal you're going to get. I won't tell you you can save yourself because you can't.
...For instance. I used birshot. So as not to blow the window.
What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?
...Will there be somethin' else?
With anything?
Now. We close now.
...What time do you go to bed.
Well... I need to close now --
This was my wife's father's place. Originally.
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.
I'm waitin' to hear your description of that.
Good. I need everything else.
Well enough.
...An attempt at humor, I suppose.
...You pick the option with the applicable rate.
Could I get another room.
No, one forty-two.
That's me.
It's called a transponder.
Not that way.
I don't mean braze.
So was I.
...You didn't take the product, did you?
No no. No. You don't understand. You can't make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He's not like you. He's not even like me.
Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America?
I ask questions. If I get sensible answers then they get to go to America. If I don't get sensible answers they don't. Is there anything about that that you don't understand?
Then I ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes.
What outfit.
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?
I questioned Joyce about all this...
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
You're lying!
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
Come on, Elden, think about it. The driver, all them trunks standing open like that... something's going on here!
That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass --
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
You must be joking.
Who are these idiots?
Do you know who I am?
...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
That's my son! My son is dead!
You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
...I don't think I know that hospital.
No... what about your sister?
What?
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it?
I gotta go.
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
I guess we all did.  You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you...
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
George...
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
...like the water purifiers?
Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!  Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?
...well, then you ain't got much.
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
You're in serious danger!
Where you headed, Betty?
No. Loma Vista.
How did you know?
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
Worse.
Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --
What are you doing?
You don't sound like you're from here.
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books, plus medical directories...  We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I'm making this my personal mission.
Guess who I saw today.
Why'd you help me in the first place?
What are those for?
Does he know you think he's real?
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
Rosa...
What?! That you had something to do with it?
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
More than you know. Is there anything else?
What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
Bourbon, little water, thank you.
That is so right.
Now, that's really stupid.
This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
It's not here. Let's go.
What the hell was that, another statement?
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...
What?
How'd they describe her?
It's a very moving experience, trust me.
What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
I said 'got it?'
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
Isn't that the point?
Really?
Alright, I admit it, you had me there. You're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
Betty, I thought this would be the best way. You know, throw you into it...
Is there a problem, George?
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
And she always had such spirit! But, after her mother died...
You're wastin' your time, Roy.
I don't know what you think you'll find, anyway.
So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
Did Chloe crack?
Her show?
I see.  Did Chloe testify?
'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.
You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?
But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed!
Whuhh...
Uh, we uh-
A miracle! It was a miracle!
I'm just makin' a point, you stupid sonofabitch!
What's his name again?
Them straw polls is ugly.
Ass right.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.
No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?
That's not my ring.
Yes, but honey -
The preacher said it absolved us.
Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still don't, really.
...Nah, that ain't right... I'm thinkin' of...
It was a moment a weakness!
Well, it's a invitation-only affair; we'll have to sneak in through the service entrance-
I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!
Okay, okay. You win.
Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?
Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!
I knew you'd make it!  Where's your girl? Didn't she come?
You're pretty funny, Mayo.
Hey, baby, you could get sent to war, get your ass shot down.
Hey, what do you say we call off this little charade of yours over a couple of beers at Trader Jon's...? Come on, man. You're about as close to being officer material as me.
Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
I know.
Whatever you say, Mayonnaise.
Now when I say "understand" I want the whole group to say, "Yes, sir!" Understand?
Louder!
I don't know what it is. It could be anything.
You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?
Is your brother a flyer?
Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean...
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
That was you guys, huh?
What did you tell him about the baby?
You little bitch! How could you? Was there ever a baby, Lynette? That's all I want to know! Did you make up that baby, Lynette? Did you??
I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.
I think we're making some of the locals jealous.
That was great.
I don't want you to move.
My old lady swallowed a bottle of pills one day while I was at school.
So, after you graduate you go on to basic flight, right? Is that in Pensacola?
Your real father was an Officer candidate like me?
Call me during the week if you get the chance.
Sure.  Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture.
How about that prick! He told me he wasn't officer material because he grew up poor like me.
The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.
You okay?
I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?
Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor?
So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time.
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
Please, Zack -- go back to the barracks!
What if she called the cops?
Two.  Squeeze harder.
You got an idea?
Are you okay?
She's gonna handle it.
Bullshit.
Fuck.
They're not supposed to be here!
Fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks!  They shouldn't be here for another week!  They don't own this house yet!
Unless Daddy comes back later.
Forty-five minutes.  That's all you said you need.  That's like nothing.
Got her right where you want her, Junior.
When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
And we're never getting in.
What do you want?
Your husband says you said "There are three..." right before you got cut off.
May I ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be?
Master bath.
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
Could the child please stop that?
Oh, I've seen these...
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We can still handle this.  Can we still handle this?
We're not gonna do anything about him, he's fine.
"Half?"  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating.
Ever read any Poe?
He's going down.
What?!
Yeah.
Small space?
We're never getting out of here.
Do it.
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
I'm sorry.
Why?
I'm sorry, Mom.
What are you doing with the gun?
Well... is it loaded?
Like?
What the fuck?
Get out of the car.
What are you crazy?
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
Drugs Judge, they're gonna flood West Oakland with dope. Jack you up and string you out like a two dollar whore. And while the community's shuffling for a fix, they're gonna snuff every Panther they can find.
Hey... Cy... what now you a righteous Panther man, you too uppity to drink with us?
Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
Man, did you see Huey down on Grove street? All up on that cop, that was beautiful.
You got it. Berkeley?
Cy... Cy... Oh shit man... who did this to you. Was it the pigs?
Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous,
You want me to put a man on it?
One: "We want freedom. We want the power to determine the destiny of our Black Community." Two: "We want full employment for our people." Three: "We want to end the robbery by the white man of our Black Community." Christ, they're asking for reparations...
I want it duly noted, that this operation was entirely under the auspices of the Oakland Police Department. The FBI doesn't have a monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy organizations, my friend. As I've said before, Agent Rodgers, we have things under control in our city...
These are memos from the commissioner, the mayor and Hoover himself, putting the Black Panthers and their subversive activities under the full jurisdiction of the Bureau.
The time, my friend, is what Sartre called, "the moment the match is being put to the fuse." Question is, is the hand holding that match gonna be black or white.
Yes sir I was.
Huh, well then...  did someone else start shooting?
...at least that takes Bobby Seale off the street...
This here's a "Panther Patrol." We see a brother getting busted. We check it out, make sure the pig don't go beating on the man. Brother gets taken downtown, we post bail, hook 'em up with a lawyer.
That's right. We'd be proud to provide as escort for Malcolm's widow. How many men you got?
No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
You were. infantry right?
We appreciate your help with this.
Judge... we're doing security for Betty Shabazz's visit next week. I'd like to have someone who knows there way around a pistol there. Someone like you.
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.
Whatever you need, I'll be there.
See, the thing about Panthers. For all their speed and strength. They are not naturally aggressive. They don't just go out killing, tearing through the jungles murdering. No, the Panther  keeps his claws hidden until he is attacked, until he's backed into a corner. Then  believe me those claws are fierce.
Listen Judge, Oakland's Panther International Headquarters. We shut the Pig's infiltration down here, they're gonna think twice about running their games on other chapters.
Yeah well, they want a lot for their money. They want a felony, preferably with "violent intent." We've got to give them something. They'll kill me if I don't. And the Panthers are going to kill me if I do. I'm scared.
Don't let the cops provoke you. We're there to watch and take badge numbers...
I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.
What's up with you?
You better just kill me Tyrone. And when Huey gets out, when Oakland's just wall to wall junkies, you tell him you blew away the only chance we all got. I'm sure he'll be real happy about that.
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?
You alright?
You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
Unh... Unh Man... I don't take no money from friends that need help. Fuck no. What do you think I am a bum?
It was Sabu killed Cy.
Motherfuck... well then I got something to do.
It's okay Mom. I'm allright.
You believe that?
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
Congratulations.
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
You got salt last week.
Excuse me?
My boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed.  Thank you for that, Colonel.
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
I beg to differ.  One is a command decision on your part.  The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.
Very well, let us move on to...
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
Their names, ranks and posts?
Do you see that, Colonel?
Father, a post rider came from Charleston.  You have a letter inside.
What news?
Father, I've lost respect for you. I thought you were a man of principle.
I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.
Alright, Corporal, you take Bennington, Harrisville, Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp.  I'll take the north side of the river. We'll meet at Snow's Island.
Is it?
Lord Cornwallis is brilliant.  His weakness is that he knows it.
Gabriel?  Are you asleep?
When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
She spoke?  Susan spoke?
He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.
You don't hate him.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
We don't have to go to war to gain independence...
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
Where is he now?
Fall, six months at the earliest.
Not me, you.  I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks.
Goodbye, Francis.
You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed.  Hide there.  If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm.  Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel.
For trying to impose some decency on that sort.
Francis, tell me about General Cornwallis.
That bad?
Put those away.
Father?
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.
Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is?
Ellie...God doesn't do things like that. I know you loved y'brother, but--
It's gorgeous!
Yes, but the rope might be--
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
No-I guess not.
I want to look around, daddy-- may I?
In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?
Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland?
Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left.
I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen.
She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy--
Ellie? What's wrong?
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
Yeah, sure.
Ellie--
Do you swear?
How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!
Hey--they actually found the place!
You need a glass?
Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?
Not yet...how much further is it?
My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed.
Bagged cat. What a mess.
Going to tell Ellie?
But--
Yes, but--
What say, Louis?
It's funny, all right.
This was their burying ground, Louis.
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
Doesn't look like they last long.
Jud, why am I doing all this?
I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception.
Why, then, things should be fine.
Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on.
--but I think the thought has crossed your mind.
I'm going to try to do better.
You better get going, hon.
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
That boat is my livelihood!
We got that part.  Anything else?
No!  You gave your word!
Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison.
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
I'll watch my back.
Like after you've killed ... Every ... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.
So what now, Jack Sparrow?  Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgement Day?
The curse drove you to gather this?
Commodore, I must protest.  Pirate or not, this man saved my life.
Elizabeth, I'm relieved you're safe.  Clap him in irons.  And behind his back this time.
No.  The pirates have taken Will --
Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift.
You may seclude yourself in my cabin.  I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate --
I know the code.
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
It doesn't!
Miss Swann.
You are despicable.
You're in league with Barbossa!
Come on!
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!
But ... you did it before!  Last time --
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
Drink up me hearties, yo ho ...
That signal is over a thousand feet high, which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction.  The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could miss it?
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?
Blast it, I'm already awake!
How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work?
Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew.  He was marooned on an island, left there to die.
We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
Raise the sails.
Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superflous.
But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
We had time to get to know each other.
I don't like the situation, Mister Sparrow.  The island is riddled with caves.  I will not put my men at a disadvantage.
You would do that?
That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough, that is.
Who makes all these?
You cheated.
Move!
I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
Shut up, before you lose them all!
Will -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid --
Are you certain this is the right way?
No.
I think he's telling the truth.
But --
Something to drink, Dr. Bright?
This is our world, Susan, and once you realize that, you will understand that the only place our path can end is on the throne of heaven.  Science is the quest for divine perfection.
I know what you're doing.
You can't do this!  You owe me, O'Brien.  I made you plastic!  I made you!
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
Gently, Ott.  Gently.
Consideration?
Can you feel it, Poppy?  The presence of the moment?  Can you feel the weight of its significance?
I was wondering if you'd finished considering?
Well, at this time, I mean that is to say, it is difficult to project --
Excellent work, Dr. Nebbleman.  You have outdone yourself.
Hey!
Here, kid, this is great stuff.  Why don't you give it a try?
Yeah?  So what?
Oh no, no, no.  No can do.  You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez!  You've got to learn to take responsibility!
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
Worse.  Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you.  She's waiting in the lab.
You were never invited to my house.
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
You think it's a coincidence that they have all these aisles lined up like this, like a little maze! We're all lab rats running through their maze, pulling lever A or lever B, each designed to create some kind of bio-chemical dependency.  All the while they're everywhere, watching us, two-way mirrors, surveillance cameras, nodding to each other, making little notes.
Susie!  You gotta help me!
You don't know?
Oh no, no, no!  You've got to be able to fix me!  Please, Susan, tell me you can make me normal again!
We don't have time for hysterics.
Pills... you know how I feel about pills.
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
Just look at it!
What's that supposed to mean?
You have no one to blame but yourself.
I want you to know that I really appreciate you helping me.
No cheese.
I didn't know what was going to happen.  I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
You saved my life.
What in the...?
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
Icky!
What in the hell?
Exactly.
Well, what else do you expect them to call you?
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
What do you want?
Oh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious.
Will you step into the library?
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?
won't even pretend it isn't a very great favor. I wish there was something I could do for you
What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
I've got a present. Shut your eyes. Keep 'em closed. I know you're going to love them.
You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
No? What do you look upon her as?
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face.
This way.
I got him his job on the paper. I'm a stock-holder, you know.
So, you see how silly that rumor is?
Give my regards to your managing editor.
How's that?
Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out. By golly, I'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore. You know our racket - after all, news is news.
Right - for the first time this year.
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story -
Is that so?
Just a boid in a gilded cage -
And live on your salary, I suppose?
How do you like your bath, sir?
Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
I think I understand, sir. You mean you want me to go?
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
Well, I've seen her pictures, and I don't think she's so hot.
Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
Thanks, thanks.
Do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates?
There you are!
No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
Okay.
Well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory.
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
What could I be?
Here you are.
Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?
What other girl?
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
The man from the Tribune seemed perfectly satisfied.
I'm sorry nobody could come.
Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousandand you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel!
Nobody seems to want to do anything  Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer a suggestion. Do what about what?
Stop calling me Mother!
Good morning, everybody  Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh?  Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you?
Yes - the worm!
Found no skeletons?
It's haunted just the same.
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Yes sir.
Can I ask you a question?
Yes ...  It's just that ...
It's okay. It's alright.
I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
There's a meatloaf sandwich in there too. Don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore.
I'm so proud of you, Bud.
Oh, hi ...
Wait ...
It's alright. Let me see.
Oh yeah.
What?
Mary Sue--C'mon ...
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
Did you do this?
Do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?
See, I know you want it to stay "Pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ...  And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...
You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
How'd you know about the fire?
David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.
Lemme see that.
Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life.
God, David. Just give it to me!
Oh my God.
Noooooo!
Jen, listen ...
What do you mean?
Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  If you need anything, I'll be right over there.
What did you do to him?
Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault. They asked me what it was about and I like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, But I told them what I DID remember, and the next thing I knew the pages had filled in.
Sure.
And you're sure about this?
So what's it like?
How?
What's that like?
What's going on?
Real rain?
Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?
Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little disaster didn't ya fella.
I know how I'd feel if mine went out. Almost like losing a friend.
Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it.
Hello there.
So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again.
BUD.
What do you mean?
Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ...
I don't know what went wrong. You answered every question. You knew every detail. The senior Prom ... McIntire's Department Store. We had all the same warm memories: Sock hops. The Church Social ...
Yeah ...
You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet.
... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ...
Aren't you a little early?
Yeah. TV busted?
Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.
Free?
Oh GOD ...
Yes, I'll be there.
Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?
Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
...please, I just don't want it....
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
Yes.
No.
....no....
No.
It doesn't matter.
No.
...yes...
I'm going to work.
Not very late.
Yes.
So you think you can?
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
This makes me very uncomfortable.
Should I just ask your girlfriend?  Maybe I should call back and talk to your girlfriend?
You lied to me?
Why did you tell me you did, then?
Come on, I thought we had fun, rich boy --
...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....
Is it ok if I leave my car you think?
Do you know them.
Hi.
Six months, maybe five, five or six months...do you wanna check that?
That's great -- Hawaii. I was thinking about going there.
...really? That's nice...are you lying?
That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.  You're friends with my sister?
Is everything ok?
What happened?
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
I don't know.
I'll see you later.
No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?
Where do you have to go?
Ok.
Your hand is bleeding.
Can I have your credit card number, followed by the expiration date?
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
Of course, it's just for us to verify your credit card information. It's completely confidential and it appears on your credit card billing statement as D&D Mattress Man.
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
Who is this?
I'll say whatever I want --
You do guaranteed sale? etc.
This is Janice the operator, who's this?
Why is it here? Barry....Barry?
No thanks.
You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?
Alright: And I have to go and buy some more pudding for this trip to Hawaii and as I just said that out loud I'm realizing it sounds a little strange but it's not. So can you come and help me out?
Yes. Sorry.
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
Seven o'clock.
I don't really remember that.
Your expenses are your own.
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
This is this place called Ace Vintage, you gotta find it, I don't know exactly where this is and I don't understand these maps so just go there and check it out. It's a '61 AC Cobra that this old guy says is fine, but I need to figure out why he's only asking 23 for it. So take a look, the whole thing, call me about that, if it seems alright then I'll head down there and check it out.
That's it.
...keys for the track. You have to gas it up and save the receipts on that. His address. We have a business address too if you need that -- but hit him at his house first, see what this little bad boy is all about and shake him up -- give him a little doe-see-doe --
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
Just tell him to call me.
You wouldn't want to go out with him anyway, honestly, he's such a freak sometimes.
I think he's weird, but that's me.
"And so the Professor lifted Colombe's skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the ways of love.' With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over her knees, and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip, as slick as an eel --"
Marquis? Is that you?
"With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --"
Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
But why must you indulge in his pornography?
Go back to your room. Quickly.
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
You've a touch of the poet, too; perhaps you should take up the quill.
Madeleine. She's besotted with me; she'd do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit --
OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!
Don't confuse one organ with another --
IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
Go to hell!
NEVER!
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
You have to believe me, I had no idea --
You're a sentimental man.
On the contrary. Let me take up this matter with the Marquis myself --
Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- and of course -- the Marquis' wife --
He'll do no such thing.
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
I'll pass the word on, then.
I'll be waiting.
You asked my name once; it's Madeleine.
At last she arrives, my hard-won bride! Hurry, my child, and scurry inside. There you'll find such treasures await you; Marzipan and meringue to sate you!
My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
I'm only a laundress; not a detective.
The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...
Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both!
It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --
I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf.
Don't toy with me, Doctor.
I am eternally in your debt.
How was I to know, my darling?
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
So you ever gonna do a picture?
You're just scared.
That poor woman.
That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
Who are you, sir?
Quite. And this is why I came to visit. Have you heard about this CITIZEN KANE picture?
He is a Bolshevik. He will have us at war by the end of the year. I think I'm going to run that wheelchair picture.
It's not really--
We're 125 million dollars in debt?
Marion--
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
You gotta wake up now. Pops.
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
There's a different between want and
That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight.
You are repellant when you drink.
castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
Miss Parsons, I have one additional question for you.
Why did we not know about this sooner?
You're not going to get another chance, boy! Look right at the monster and you tell him--
Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself wants me to see the picture today.
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
I don't know what you expected with Joseph- fucking-Conrad for Chrissake. I mean this is Hollywood, pal.
What are movies about?
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
So, we've got to come up with our movie. Our biography.
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
Manolete?!
Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
Let me out.
So, who is he? We have to know him.
Well, at least she's off KANE today
Hedy Lamarr?
If he had known about KANE before you made it, you'd be dead already.
You gonna watch?
Not one of them today has what you had, Miss Davies. Not one of them.
Of course, of course. How can we be of service?
Very generous
You talked to New York?
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.
The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!
Well it' s all you've got !
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
Do you every think for one second that you might have some responsibility for what you're doing?! For cutting and slashing everything in your way so you can have your goddamn movie?!
You're not still mad at me, I hope
I think you better sit down
Orson, you wanna take five?
It's just not low enough. This is the scene. We have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky. As towering virtues in combat--
He's Christ?
Look Joey, I wanna tell you something. Your brother ain't gonna get nowhere without us -- nowhere. And I'm tellin' you between the two of us, it's gettin' to the point where it's gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment.
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again.
How do you know? You know her that good?
Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
Whatcha doin'?
All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait.
What?
What do you mean, "you"?
What do you mean, "you"?
Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody.
I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
You just fought Sugar Ray two weeks ago and you're training like this right now... Are you afraid Sugar Ray might beat you this time?
Ain't she beautiful? Coulda been Mrs. America if I didn't pull her outa the contest. Didn't want her wearing a swimsuit for nobody but me.
Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!
It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out.
Nine o'clock.
You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
Are you sure we should be doing this?
You said never to touch you before a fight.
Now take the rest off.
What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him?
In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep?
Huh?
You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
But Jake... I didn't say anything...
What'd you see?
You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.
You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?
I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.
The kids are sleeping.
But they don't have a case against you.
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
How's the weight? Ok?
No, you're his wife.
It don't look right.
-- until yesterday morning.
At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence.
A detective's nightmare.
Forget the story -- find the trunk. Mrs. Thorwald's in it!
Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.
Jefferies.
That's too bad, Jeff. Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day. Forget I called.
Jeff --
Hello.
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
I knew it!
Her father loading up the shotgun?
The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.
We've progressed emotionally in --
People have different emotional levels that --
When I married Myles, we were both maladjusted misfits. We still are. And we've loved every minute of it.
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
Keep your mind off her.
Isn't he a salesman?
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
What are you two talking about?
What do you need money for?
Who's Thorwald?
And your stomach?
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
Don't laugh. -- I could do it!
That's what is know as "manless melancholia."
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.
Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
Oh, I do that all the time. Whenever I have a few minutes after lunch.
What do you think?
Lisa, please!
It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?
The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.
I wonder where he's going now?
All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work.
And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?
They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
We have all -- what?
I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
From his landlord -- once a month.
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
I hate funny exit lines.
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
Whatever happened to that old saying "Love Thy Neighbor."
Well?
Wasn't that close?
Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag.  During that phone conversation he held up three rings -- one with a diamond -- one with a big stone of some kind -- and one plain gold band.
Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look.
What for?
Steady Marlon!
What's that?
Buzzie--we better get out of here.
Feel okay?
Hey, he's real abstract and different.
Meaning me?
Where can we meet?
Just him.
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
No.  We're going to bring him down.
No.
Mother--
The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
Except yourself!
I don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink.
No.  I definitely don't.  I did the sa--
I was talking to Jim.
Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
I guess when I nearly died giving birth to you--that shows how much I don't care!
I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
I don't know.  First I thought it was Jim but--
John Crawford?
She keep it to protect herself, sir. She scared without a man in the house.
Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them!
Excuse me--but--You know where I can find--I mean I don't remember his last name--
He's not here.  He's not at Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where he is.  He's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  How old are you?
Hi.
Boy!
Who has?
They're looking for you!--
Nobody talks to children!  They just tell them one thing and mean another.
I don't want you for my father!
Why?
No.
I'm sorry.
'Bye, Mom.
What happened, darling.  We were so worried.  I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.
Hey!  That's enough static out of you.
Hi.  I saw you before.
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
Yeah--why--
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
It doesn't matter to them.
You cold?
I'm getting that way, too.
Well--we're newlyweds.
What?
You smell like baby powder.
Children?  Well, we really don't encourage them.  They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
Hi, Plato!
He makes you feel pretty unhappy?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
He wants... your "sister"...
He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
Toys for... adults?
Negative five?
I don't think it's negative five.
No, c'mon --
Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
You need a COAT!
...the truck driver...
He'll kill you.
No, Nick, no --
Nick died for me....
He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --
He working for them on this one?
And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
They've never done a robbery?
I love you, Nick...
We need to find a way to make me part of it.
He wants to see your map.
I saved your life.
No, you can't --
Put him in the truck.
You what...
You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus.
She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
What'd they call her in high school?
How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day.
What?
We walked the place for a week.
They wouldn't have changed the security setup.
So what the hell good are you...
A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through?
Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?
A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
So. You're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. You're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front.  You need six.
No way.
No gun.
Can't be attracting attention, right?
Here ya go, convict. We cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. What you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it.
Where the HELL did he go?
Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm begging. This is not some card club, 'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an international gaming destination. We're in guidebooks. You can't do this... you can't do this to me...
I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!
Capades? They don't do it. Mittens? Outlawed. Why?
I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
The Powwow Safe?
What about the Powwow Safe?
Knew a guy in Joliet, smoked ten packs a day like you. His lungs got so black they couldn't find 'em with an x-ray.
...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...
You want that for here or to go?
You gotta get someone upstairs.
Here's my present to you, truck drivers --
Monsters in the gelatin...
THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN!
Hell you haven't.
We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.
Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting.
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
Why you gotta. We were gonna give you a ride someplace, man. Now I just don't know.
She's using a new perfume.
Don't move, Rudy!
Tell Ashley... I...
Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
Start talkin
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know.
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.
Joe, you're making a terrible mistake I can't let you make.
Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
What does it matter who stays with the cop? We ain't lettin' him go. Not after he's seen everybody. You should've never took him outta your trunk in the first place.
Go ahead and laugh, you know what I mean. What a while bitch will put up with, a black bitch won't put up with for a minute. They got a line, and if you cross it, they fuck you up.
I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
Me and Mr. White?
What?
Just hold on buddy boy.
I just want you to know, Joe, how much I appreciate your care packages on the inside.
Wong?
Why can't we pick out our own colors?
Give me this fucking thing.
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
What's the cut, poppa?
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?
He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?
Aren't you?
So, talk.
What're you talkin' about?
Why?
Hey, just cancel that shit right now! You're hurt. You're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying.
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
C'mon, throw in a buck.
I'd go over twelve percent for that.
Do you know what this is? It's the world's smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses.
Waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country. It's the one job basically any woman can get, and make a living on. The reason is because of tips.
Gun shot.
Dead.
You really think we were set up?
Okay, let's go through what happened. We're in the place, everything's going fine. Then the alarm gets tripped. I turn around and all these cops are outside. You're right, it was like, bam! I blink my eyes are they're there. Everybody starts going apeshit. Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin' all the -
Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody?
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute.
So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up.
Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
Well, I guess we drop him off at the hospital. Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
And that's more important than finding Lednov?
What's she doin' runnin' around the country at night.
You don't know how good it is to see you.
Yes, ma'am.
We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
And this is Helen Carter.
So am I.
Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
Coffee?
You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?
Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking. 
He knows his alphabet.
Are we leaving?
Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.
You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.
What did you expect? Speeches I don't mean?
Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
I won't have you fighting over me.
Maybe it isn't going to Sonora, but it's going somewhere, which is all right with me.
I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.
Thanks for taking over.
Here's a man says he's looking for you girls.
I can't --
How does she draw?
Who's Lednov?
Like why you're buyin' a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.
What was he in jail for?
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
That's Lednov!  We come along here.
Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle.
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
Maybe you shoulda killed him.
It is so your fault and... and I guess maybe when we hit the ranch... you andme better...
You're not bein' quite fair.
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know you had a daughter.
I can't take her with me.
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here where I belong.
That something I shouldn't see?
And you're all alone.
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
It isn't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of.
I tried my best, but these things take time.
We don't want to go there.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
Maybe I better start working on him.
-- Gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar. Cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing. What do you think of that?
Clay Phillips.
That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.
Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
It wasn't Clay's fault. We've been moving around most all the time -- mebbe when we get the ranch and stay in one place I can learn my letters then --
Good night, Miss Wells.
Then I know my alphabet.
-- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
What do they look like?
Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
Don't pay any attention to him. That's his way and I've found he's sure easy to get along with. I don't recollect him havin' hit me more'n a couple of times and I guess I had it comin'.
You stretch out. I'll fix something to eat.
Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
Oh, remember that time I got my training bra and you --
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
Help!
It's coming!
This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
Hello Brenda.
Shhh... It's okay.
You sure?
Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.
Ray, run faster.
Hey, you left your book back there.
So, I see you're really into spooks.
Dude, somebody's on the rag.
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
What about you, Buddy?
What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.
Feel that?
Better try a little higher.
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
Hey, wanna' share a soda?
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
Where's Shorty?
Both of them?
He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
Yes, we made it!
Huh?
I take it you're not mad at me.
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top.
As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration.
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
Would you please focus?
So, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close- up?
Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.
The image there.
I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
What the hell?!
What are you working on?
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
Alright... I might need your help.
No thanks.
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
Now you're being rude, Shorty.
"Fucked me."
"Ray!"
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.
What a bitch!
DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!
Just a little, please. Bad for the teeth.
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
In here, Mom...
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
You've been working in that video shop too long.
Look at this!  "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!"
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
Shhhh..
Yeah! Oohhhh! Get it!
There's Dede! He's my favorite chickadee! He's here every morning for breakfast.
Let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days.
Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
Who is this?
So you do drink?
Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!
Mrs. Hinkle, are you insane?
Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
Mr. Pickle! Did you see anybody in the booth next to you?
Ooohhhhhh! I made it all up! I never saw Beverly Sutphin in my life!
Who wants fruit salad?
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
He killed people, Mom.
It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?
You got your wish.
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!
SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
I've been waitin' for you Miss Gibson. I want you to know I've decided to take your case.
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
The acceptance of a secret is an obligation and in this case my dear, the obligation carried with it the necessity of dying if one betrayed that secret. You understand that don't you?
No.
Mr. Ward will see you in just a few minutes. Won't you wait, Dr. Judd?
It's not just for myself I'm asking. Her sister is here. The kid's half crazy with anxiety.
I'll give you a check.
About forty-five dollars.
Why, Mary --
Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village -	"The Dante."
Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right. I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby.
The tip is, anyhow. I like to work on your hair.
I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.
However, I won't say that I'll not take charge occasionally, and I'm going to take charge new. I've a job for you.
You could have told me any time you were Jacqueline's husband.
Don't. We know what happened. Don't go on.
But I understand her. That may be more important.
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want - surrender herself to the police  stand trial  I don't think he knows.
Who are you?
I'm tired of being afraid - of waiting.
I don't know.
Please, Jacqueline.
You'll be all right?
That's it. And this figure --she traced it. The book I saw at the library had been marked "perfect" by the library inspector in March. Mrs. Redi had it out in April. No one else had read it since.
Look. I'm serious. It's a real and vary earnest society -- a dangerous society...
Jason, my pet 
What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
Why can't everyone be happy like we are -- laugh and have good times. Look at that poor little one  so sad because she can't find her sister. And that man with her - he doesn't make her laugh  he just sits and talks.
Why, Mr. Jason. Most of these books are on the closed shelf. You have to get permission.
See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.
What was she to you?
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
Yes. When I tell you.
I'm afraid this is no time to play Cyrano, my friend. What was in your mind?
What?
It's my cloven hoof. It trips me up sometimes.
Yes. You could become a country wife -- fool around with petunias and pullets.
I'd hardly describe It that way - The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice  that's it, isn't it?
I'm afraid you have mistaken my motive, Louis. I thought you might understand and sympathize.
Are we?	I thought I was very gay.
Is it about Jacqueline?
But I'm not coming to you out of deep conviction, I'm coming to you out of loss. I no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good.
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
Yes.
Yes  yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
Is it fifteen minutes yet?
Because I have something very important to do.
You have only to stretch out your hand, take up the glass and drink a little.
You play an instrument?
...free-lance. You know.
How long has it been since you've seen John?
Why'd you drop out?
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway.
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
So you don't believe in therapy?
Of course not.
Are you in the middle of something?
Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.
Because I enjoy interviewing women more than men.
What about sex?
Like what?
I don't... why... why do you do this?
This is just... so...
I'm not sure why I came here. I had kind of decided not to talk to you after... you know.
John and Cynthia have been... "fucking".
How did you know?
Why didn't you tell me?
Do you think that's such a good idea?
Tell me your name.
Do you talk to him?
I don't see what difference it makes, I mean, I can think what I want.  I don't know if I want to do this anymore, I'm afraid... I don't mind answering the questions so much, but if somebody were to see this...
Yes. Whenever... all right, look. Whenever I see a man that I think is attractive, I wonder what it would be like with him, I mean, I'm just curious, I don't act on it, but I hate that I think that!! I wish I could just forget about that stuff!!
About me?
If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean?
Can't.
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
Interesting analogy.
If you were in love with me, would you?
But if you were?
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
Who? Elizabeth?
But that was part of it?
Like maybe a big part?
Why are you ashamed?
I want to know why you are the way you are!
I want to touch you.
Graham and I were talking about apartments and I told him to check the Garden District, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff.
Jesus Christ, where'd that come from? I have a late lunch by myself and now I'm fucking somebody?
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
What?
Where did you go when you left here?
Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!!  Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him.
But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
No, he left last week.
Ann, in life one has to be aware of hidden agendas.  Did it occur to you that Graham may have his own reasons for not wanting you to be in therapy?
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
I say it because it's descriptive.
Ann, you always underestimate me.
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
I just thought it might --
Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.
What!?
You couldn't do it, period.
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
I get real busy between two and four.
Do I know you?
She didn't give you my address?
And that's all?
How do we start?
And you ask questions, right?
Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?
What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Prettier than Ann?
Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?
I would.
I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
Hello.
Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it.
Everybody has a past.
Give me your keys.
Hi.
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
You knew these people?
OK, Roger. Here's the stuff you wanted. Files on Horsefield, Tudor, Swinburne, and Velakofsky. Papers published by Hobbes, Linsky, and Lefebvre in a couple of issues of the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical Association and also the Journal of the American Medical Association. And, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files I helped compile before your time here, Doctor. I thought they might interest you.
Kiss, kiss?
Well? Supper at my place?
Can I call you at the office?
You say something?
Go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second-degree burns. It'll have to do for now.  What's your number? The number of your apartment?
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.
Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but you won't find any real meat in them.
I don't get it.
How's Brad?
Sank you!  Velcome!  Sank you!
They should be sent to the Danube before Dawn.
You got it!
When do I get to see Brad?
Of course, Mrs. Majors -- Janet -- But I'm puzzled.  If she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract?
We're the experts.
McKinley?...McKinley?
I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this.  We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips!
Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.
Did you /hear/ that, Oliver.
Care to indulge?
That's us.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY
AN' YOU'RE A WEEPER AND A WAILER ALWAYS TREADING THE TOES OF THE GREAT GENERALLY SPREADING YOUR WEIGHT YOU'RE A SPITEFUL, HATEFUL ASININE CREATURE A PUPIL WITH NO SCRUPLES WHO KNEW BETTER THAN THE TEACHER
LIKE A VIRGIN WITH AN' URGIN' IN A SURGERY I'LL BE SWINGING -- I'LL BE BRINGING OUT THE NURSE IN ME
We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  Is this true?
Could you tell us a little about it?
Could I do that later?
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.
Dentonvale...say, that's for...  I'm sorry to hear that, Janet.  Look I'm going to let you through, but keep it to yourself, otherwise...
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you!
Brad!
BRAD!
F for...
F for...
Ah.  Mr. And Mrs. Majors.  How wonderful to see you.  I am Dr. Cosmo McKinley and this is my sister, and colleague, Nation McKinley.
Our field.
This could be worse than the old series.
So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...
It's Christine.  Hey you.
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
I ask you one simple question, and suddenly I'm attacking you.
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
When's that novel of yours coming out?  We  all want to read it.
Glass or bottle?
They're from both of us.
And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
Are you a writer too?
That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys.
Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
Why did you tell them my book was being published?
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
Oh, that's tasty.
Just tell me.
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
How old's she going to be?
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
You still seeing that shrink?
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county.  Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
This is rose, right?
Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
How would you rate this one?
You know, you could work in a wine store.
I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
We should have driven.
You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
Yeah. Tight.
Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
Have you no shame?
Nice, huh?
A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on.
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
And don't drink too much. I don't want you going to the dark side or passing out. Do you hear me? No going to the dark side.
Pull yourself together, man.
Right now.
What the fuck are you doing?
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
Call me on my cell if you go out.
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
What do you think's going on?
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
What?
You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
Do you like them?
Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
Please, Miles, please.
She tell you she was married?
So what the fuck were you thinking?
Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
Hey, Jack. Jack.
Yep. Quite a day.
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
Look at this!
Love you, man.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
Hi.
She got anything good?
It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
Yeah, weird. But great.
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
Victoria! How the hell are you?
Where are you?
Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.
Sir, what are you doing?
So what do you think?
What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine.
Should we get dessert?
So what are you up to today, Miles?
Huh.
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
See you, Miles. You take care.
A famous actor who's getting married next week.
It was a surprise, Mom.
You talked to Wendy?
Daddy.
I don't want you to die.
...Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He'll always take care of her.
I got the bat at home... On the wall.
Pharmacy crowded?
It's noise.
It's probably picking up another baby monitor.
Morgan, be careful.
How can you say that?
For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?
Merrill!
He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.
He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.
That's good enough for me.
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
I can't even imagine.
It's the strangest thing Father.
I don't think so.
It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.
Is he okay?
Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world.  Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill?
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
Well, Kate, it was self-defense sure enough, but I think you'd have to say I killed old Murdo. I think that's definitely the word.
I almost didn't.
More than enough.
Jefferson City?
Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay.
South of here, past Chimayo.
I gotta be going.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
Where you been?
Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett. He's a friend of mine.  This is Sheriff Cobb.
I'll see you around.
You own this land.
That's a lie.
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
That's the longest I ever did it. 'Bout bust a gut.
That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
You can't do this.
There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them.  Are these your friends?
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
He was murdered.
Why come to me?
He must be pretty good.
Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.
You've got a legitimate job.
You got a place to stay?
You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything will be put straight in a few days.
My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon.
That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
It's an advance. We want him to know he's going to be happy here.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
-- It's called a projector.
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
The picture's dead.
Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
She was there.  She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
-- Viktor, are you with her?  Is she there?
Are you and Simone...  ... getting married?
Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
... Simone.
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
I'm going to tell you a secret now, Elaine.  Simone is not a real person.  I invented her.
Thank you!  I don't know how you did it but thank you.
You had no choice, Elaine.  He's a liability.
Don't I know it.  That's the only reason I'm here now -- to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
Absolutely not!
I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
Good and bad.  They think that's what caused this.  Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen.  It's the size of a grapefruit.  Heavy too.
-- Flesh is weak.
Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
-- I know, I don't know anything.
One thing bothered me.
Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
I remember when the Echo had class -- the paper that could bring down governments.
Nice boat, Taransky.
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
I traced her to a nursing home.  A young woman fitting Simone's description dropped her off five years ago.
That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until I get a court order for a blood test.
-- Nicola!  How was your massage?
Then show some.  They'll shut me down!
Would you like me to read?
You could play the lead.
No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
Hi.
Simone, are you there?
Good morning, Simone.
You did create me.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
Why, Malcolm?
Why did you leave me?
Goodnight, Malcolm.
All your soldiers speak Latin?
I got an award once. From the Mayor.
Everybody got upset. They had a meeting. Momma started crying.  I don't draw like that anymore.
I draw people with smiles, dogs running, and rainbows.  They don't have meetings about rainbows.
You want to ask me a question?
Know what?
Cats?
Yes?
I'm going to transfer you. I know two psychologists that are exceptional--
--What?
Something happened, didn't it?
I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.
Don't go home, okay?
They're right here.
It was Grandma's. It's not for playing.  What if it broke? You know how sad I'd be.
You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
Someone got hurt.
A lady. She died.
I would never think that about you... ever... Got it?
I don't like people looking at me like that.
I don't know how else to look--
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
'Course, some folks say 'ol Jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the Macdonalds.
You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
See?
Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?
Listen to me, you banjo-dueling, country ass hayseed... I want my Nikes and I want them now!
Fuck you.
Rod... I have to get back to my job.
Aha. The Lovers.
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
Sounds familiar.
You know, one day I'm going to have to shut down that still of yours, Jeremiah.
Wrong. Fratricide is when you gun down your brother. You're out. My turn.
"Peggy-Sue" --
Damn! These are one hundred dollar Nikes!
Hmmm. This shit isn't bad.
I came back for the funeral. That's all.
That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.
Then who?! Because someone wants another blood harvest. With human blood, Jeremiah! Just like Jethro! Who did he kill back then, Jeremiah? Farmhands? Transients? People no one would miss? "Crazy Old Macdonald!" But now... it's starting again, isn't it? Someone's picking up where Jethro left off!
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
Never heard of it.
Ow!
You know what they say about men who need big guns...
Down boy.
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
What the fuck you talking about, man?
Shit!
You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break.
Time for a little... "feedback" guys. That guy from Hectic Records --
So?
Getting ready.
Suzie --
You're... limping.
The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...
I almost thought for a second...
Where's Mac?
Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
Pretty, ain't they?
Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?
Rorschach.
Looks like a chipmunk.
Already ain't. Married a gal named --
Sure thing, killer.
Flip.
That's not true -- Where are you--?
What are you doing?
Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your -- ?
Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too.
Ain't no mystery to it. She's raised in them shanties off St. Luc. Dirt--poor.
Praise Jesus.
You.
Aw, ain't you glad to see me, Bandit?
I hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen Beaners up to West Virginia.
Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig.
Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
Okay. I was in Texas dancing in an industrial show for Sunkist Oranges. They say I'm the new Anita Bryant. But I'm really a dancer from New York. A lot of credits. Moderate talent.  Anyway, after opening night, I was walking back to the motor lodge and suddenly there he was. A tall Texan with a twenty-nine inch waist. Pure dynamite.
Why're you driving so fast?
You have a great profile.
That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
Christ, what channel are we on?...
The bus'll pick you up over there.  Uh... you got enough bread for a ticket?
What the hell are you doing?!?
By stealing my car?
Yeah.
Where did you learn how to drive like this?
Let's hit it.
An unmarked police car.
-- It's hard to believe this schmuck Kyle would go to such lengths for Coors beer.
What kind of a guy is he?
Why should I?
I'm working, Bandit. Besides, what's the matter? Won't your new girl friend help you?
That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
What are you doin' now?
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
Liquid gold.
We still on schedule?
Do I have a choice?
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line.
Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far.
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
My handle's Silver Tongued Devil and I'm here to tell you, your fellow CB'ers are mighty proud of y'all.
Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa?
Five thou.
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall- to-wall major felony offenses, murder, extortion, arson, grand larceny --  -- A paternity suit... I just feel like we're playing catch-up with all this and we shouldn't be.
What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
How bad?
Man, that's great.
About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
Yeah, we've been through that.
-- Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I?  Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?
What'd you say?
Jesus Hugo! How is it that you can turn a simple conversation into a fucking hedge maze!? This is zero degree of difficulty man!
Y'ain't never had to wash another man's blood off, dig it out y'fingernails... Y'had us for that. Y'ain't ever made a real beef on y'own, shit as light in the ass as you are, I'll bet you ain't ever made anything more than a fuck'n fist your whole life.  So if you think I'mma let your lil' punk-ass, with the dirt I've done for you, in the eleventh hour, sell me off like some fucking field nigger, hand me up to the Feds like y'last chip, then you done gone straight out-your-motherfucking MIND!
Baby, I've been co-habitating with these people for the past thirty odd hours and in so doing, have stared into the face of hell. These are the premier prick cocksuckers of all time and I feel beaten by them, I feel bloodied --
So he's personally issued the contract on Israel?
...So you knew all this and yet y--
You got clicks, anything?
Alright, now Buzzy -- this is, this is it, here, okay, so listen to me careful and wait till I'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop.
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
Wow.
No shit.
Buzzy... Buzz...?
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
That takes some of the sting out.
We gotta lay something out, strategy- wise. Somethin' tight. Y'go in there ad-libbing, it's y'ass.
You got the fifty up? Bitch y'tryin' t'take down a jumbo jet? Blown the moon out the sky? T'fuck you wanna get that grimy?
I'm not givin' it up jus' yet...
Forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent finders fee for me.
You think you're dreaming me, like you dream her.  Understand something: I am the real Gibarian.  Just a new incarnation.
You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.
You'll end up like me.
They shouldn't let people like you into space.
Listen --
Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants?
Why would you let her to do that?
Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.
I told you, try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
Probably.
You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that --
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
What happened?
She knows everything.  She knows who she is.
What are they?
Rheya...
Not a very happy poem.
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
Is it a planet?
Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
What happened?
I would have these -- I don't know how to describe them -- visions, when I was younger.  Maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states.  Time would just collapse, I would be inside time.  I would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped.  Freaky stuff.
I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
I like that too.
Why did she do it?
Was she right?
That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this?
You never said you wanted one.
Is that really what you want?
Where did you go before?
We thought you'd be alone.  We want to talk about...
Followed by non-human manifestations.
Gibarian was under enormous --
Snow, get up here, now.
You want it coming back with us?
Occasionally.
Hi.
What did he say?
Let's get a drink.
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
What about Neil?
Yeah.
I don't know you...
Where?
When can I see you?
I don't know.  It wouldn't be very smart.
It wouldn't work.
"For"...?
... Mike.
Claire!
You don't have to, now.
I'll miss you, Mike.
I like your coat.
Say goodbye, Mike.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
Keep what handy?
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own.  We can afford it now.
My ass if falling.
My ass is falling.  It is.
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
Tomorrow, I start looking for our house... You love me?
Changing the sparks.  They showed it on TV.  What d'you think?
She took you shopping for a tie?
Coming to bed?
What was that?
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
You gotta get another tour.  We're gettin' too old for this.
Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today?  He misses you...
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
Let me drive...
I'm going to visit my sister for a few days.  I'd like you to get your stuff out.
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
What about when she goes out?
I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike?
Hey Mike, out of the bag into the bureau, huh... How do you like it so far?
Uh, yeah.  I'm a policeman.
Are you in charge here?
I asked for the man in charge...
You're here 'til what time?
You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You didn't do what I said.
What're we having?
Except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere!  I'd like to kill the guy who invented those things.
How about dinner tonight?
Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.
Here you go, Pete.
S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
Ya set for, uh, ya know-- money?
Lizzy!
"Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
Too hip.  Your photos suck, kid.
Would you cool it already?
Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
My my.
I suppose.
Oh, don't do it on my account--
Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
Peter?
This may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know.
I am old enough to--
Oh, not that.  You promised you'd burn it.
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
Poison emergency.
Is this some sort of Zen thing?
Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron
A bit melodramatic but if you could prove it that would tie in your unified field theory, the Big Bang, Kaluza-Klein--
Mr. Parker.
Peter, what can I do for you?
No
So they're airing this tonight?
You're sure you're all right.
Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become whatever it is you are?
I see.  Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
Don't let him kid you. Cagney couldn't have pulled a sweeter job.  All right, boys. We were waiting in the depot in Frankfurt, see? And there was an ammunition train coming through, the longest ammunition train you ever saw, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room, see? Fixes himself a time bomb, busts open the window and just as the train moves out, lays the thing in there, see? So then, he comes out like nothing's happened and three minutes later you can hear it -- boom! Broke every window in Frankfurt. It was gorgeous!
We made a deal with Barrack One.
What's the match gag?
Come on!
Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.
Hold it, Sefton. So we heard some shots -- so who says they didn't get away?
Come on, Trader Horn! Let's hear it: what'd you give the Krauts for that egg?
The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished.
Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?
Shut off the moaning, or we'll have the dogs on us. Shut it off, Lieutenant. This is orders!
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
I didn't do it. I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
It is.
Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
Hey -- Russki -- Russki! Look at those bublichkis! Over here!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
Easy, Animal! Easy!
Don't you remember, Animal? A chicken lays those things.
Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!
You'll fix me up!
To the Brick Kremlin!
Hey! This is with a typewriter! It's from a finance company!
Why don't we just look in those footlockers?
Grable, not Gable!
Let me do it, Hoffy.
As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
Good evening, Sergeants.  A bit dank in here, isn't it?... Where is the Baracken-Fuehrer?
Look -- if you don't like the way I'm handling this job --
You're wasting your time, Duke.  Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.
Cut the horseplay, Harry. What's the matter with you guys?
Stay out of it, Sefton.
Says me.
I told you boys I'm no escape artist, but for the first time, I like the odds. Because now I got me a decoy.
Shapiro. Shapiro.
And what's that crack supposed to mean?
Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.
Stop that, will you!  Those idiots! So they sprang Dunbar! So what good is it? He's still in the compound, isn't he? How long can he last? Where can they hide him?
Are we going to stand around here and listen to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?
December seventh, forty-one.
Which one of us is the informer?
We have no radio.
Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
No use, Schulz. You might as well come clean. Why don't you just tell 'em it's me. Because I'm really the illegitimate son of Hitler. And after the Germans win the war you'll make me the Gauleiter of Zinzinnati.
Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
I'll make it five hundred!
Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
My grandmother's ear-muffs.
Tomorrow I want to make a tri-elliptical jump. That's where you jump out over Northern China and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry.
According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years
Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
Courage is an emotion too, Data.  Now, can you project the course of the ribbon?
Now, you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered, could that also affect the course of the ribbon?
Are any of them inhabited?
"Lifeforms tiny little lifeforms. Where are the lifeforms-"
Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?
I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
Guinan. It's important that you tell me what you know. We think Soran's developed a weapon...a terrible weapon. It might give him enough power to-
It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me.  I knew things about people, about events, about time.
Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
I know exactly where I want to go, and when. Back to that mountaintop on Veridian III, before Soran put out the star. I have to stop him.
Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.
Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft thrusters ahead one quarter, port and starboard at station keeping.  Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if you would give the order to get underway.
No, no, it's not. It's better.
How can I argue with the captain of the Enterprise? What was the name of that planet=8A Veridian III?
But I do have a theory...
Imagine what it was like, Will. No engines, no computers, just the wind, the sea and the stars to guide you.
Sir, is there anything wrong?
I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.
I'm afraid I can't just leave it at that. The commanding officer of this ship is clearly distraught about something. As ship's counselor, it's my duty to-
Captain, Im sorry.  I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.
Your family history is very important to you, isn't it?
The royal...studs?
Enterprise maintaining full impulse power...
Aye sir, coding now.
Hello, sir. It's David.
It's okay -- I should have known you'd come... Saavik's right: this planet is unstable. It's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours.
Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've <u>got</u> to find out what it is...
Well. There's your life form reading. These were microbes on the tube's surface. We shot them here from Enterprise.  They were fruitful, and multiplied.
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
I don't understand.
If equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form.
Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb.
Ah, Saavik, that's, ah, extroadinary. What would you, ah, like to do next?
I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
How many more?
On course, Admiral. Estimating Spacedock in two point one hours.
... We have cleared Spacedoors.
Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries?
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
Give me your hand and we both live.
Ambassador, I -- I had no idea you were here...  I think you know my crew...
Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...
Then, how --
... The needs of the many outweigh...
What I have done, I had to do.
I'll be in my quarters. Execute course to the Federation Boundary.
Firing range, sir.
Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
Twenty-two, eighty-three...
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
Say thank you.
What DO you want? Damn it, why isn't there a girl here? You know this has nothing to do with age. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies.
Shore leave, Admiral.
You okay, Jim? How do you feel?
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
Jim... read me? Can you read me?
You did this -- in a day?!
David --
Jim --
So are we, it looks like.
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
It's a long story.
I don't mean to intrude.
It was just words.
Let go -- he can't -- !
Careful: Not all at once. <u>The</u> <u>engine room</u>. Lock on target and prepare to fire.
At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE! Why can't you?
-- But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you: I, Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you attempted to cage forever.
Thirty seconds...
Time's up, Admiral...
Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
You are in a position to demand nothing, sir. I, on the other hand, am in a position to grant nothing. What you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the <u>Botany Bay</u>, marooned here fifteen years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.
Scotty -- what's left?
I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til the radiation dissipates.
Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right.
Midshipman, you're a tiger.
Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your protg's first rare -- a trifle emotional --
I would not presume to debate you.
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
Admiral, you can't give him Genesis...
What IS working around here?
Captain Spock, if you do not hear from us within <u>one hour</u> your orders are to restore what power you can, take the Enterprise to the nearest Star Base and alert Starfleet command when you are out of jamming range.
Any suggestions, Admiral?
May I speak, sir?
I did not think so.
That was a little joke.
Yes.
Khan!
That was close --
Saavik, get us out, best speed!
Time from my mark...
After you dismiss the company, you will take the watch. Set course for Ceti Alpha V and we'll pick up survivors.
I really must thank you.
You lied.
I would accept that as an axiom.
Humans make illogical decisions...
And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
Well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive.
You'd think they could at least send a ship. Bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this Klingon flea trap...
I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!
Oh, joy.
Wake up, man, wake up!
Congratulations, Jim. I think you've saved the Earth.
Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.
Fundoscopic examination --
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
What's causing that!?
... It gives me a great sense of history.
How long?
All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?
Go ahead. Stun me.
Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now available in all modes of flight.
Ah, well done, team 2.
Can you protect us?
They are mature humpbacks, weighing 45,000 pounds each. They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were brought here. We call them George and Gracie.
Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
We don't want to be any trouble.
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
How will that be done, exactly?
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
What's that?
Wanna try it from the top?
Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
... What does that mean?
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
Where are you going?!
Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin.
Spock...
You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
It's her -- from the Institute. If we play our cards right, we may learn when those whales are really leaving.
I meant --
Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
Admiral. Full power is restored.
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?
You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>.  Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?!  Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.
Individual whale song getting stronger... This is strange, Admiral. The song is directly ahead. It's coming from San Francisco.
Admiral, I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees.
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
I'll have to re-energize.
Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
You better get up there, sir. We're having some power fall-off...
The whales...?!
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
I am well, Admiral.
Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye.
Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --
Professor Scott, if you'll --
With pleasure.
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
Hi.
It is kind of you to make this effort.
Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?  
We were under the impression they were being held against their will.
There are days.
The craftsmanship is extraordinary.
When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...
You're Ro'tin, aren't you...? There's something in the voice.  Would you be his friend Gal'na?  I helped your mother bathe you when you were a child. She still speaks of you.
But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.
I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
Don't you ever get tired?
Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child...
Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.
Won't he rust?
I believe the boy is... afraid... of me.
Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills...
Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?
Your android has turned dangerously violent, Captain... Considerable damage was done to my ship. He must be destroyed.
It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.
... and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal...
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?
The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations.
Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.
A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.
What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...
Moving them is one thing. Killing them all...
I want our guests to depart as quickly a etiquette allows. I'll ask Worf to delay his return to DS9 so he can join us. We're going to stop by sector four-four- one on our way to the Goren system.
In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
Aye, sir. Highly volatile...I recommend we keep our distance...
What's inside that nebula cluster?
They need us to mediate some territorial dispute...
... and gorgonzolla cheese.
There's a short letter I left you all, just some... sentimental nonsense... the computer will bring it to your attention at oh- four-hundred... I'd just as soon you delete it...
Captain...
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
Scanners are off line!
Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?
Sir, inertial coupling is exceeding tolerance... if we don't release him, he may destroy both vessels...
Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...?
Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...
What you're doing to my neck...
Why don't you try sitting up?
Admiral... what's the status of the Borg fleet?
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
Are you saying they won't help us?
But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
You think they're still up there?
You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...?
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.
Yes...
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
Juice?
Where's the battery room for the hospital?
What did you do to the batteries?
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
We can't leave her out there. When the ship launches... she'll be killed.
Entering the upper ionospere...
Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
Their com system must still be down.
Jean-Luc Picard.
Invasion.
Take care of him. He's a very special man.
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
What makes you say that?
Lie. That's one. Keep going.
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
Incoming transmission from the Borg.
Life signs?
Captain...?
Track their weapons fire.
Time travel... they're attempting time travel...  Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command!
Captain, I've found the Borg Sphere. It's on the far side of the planet...firing at the surface.
Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.
Target locked!
And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow.  As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...
Return to our own time?
I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success.
To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge.
What are they doing?
Report.
Someone...?
All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
Worf? Is something wrong?
What the hell happened down there, Worf?
No response.  I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
- <U>Kobayashi Maru</U>...
Specifically of...?
What kind of creature is this? Last night you two were spooning -
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
It's the viridium patch Spock slapped on my back right before we went aboard Gorkon's ship.
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The record clearly there were no other ships in the sector.
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
Torpedo room--?
Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --
Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "Stun" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...
From Starfleet?
Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.
Thank you, Captain.
An accident wasn't good enough...
And your coat.
Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed...
Aye, sir.
Sorry -
Who is "US?"
I'm getting underway now. But you should know, I'm in alpha Quadrant. The chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim.
According to my information, today.
WE volunteered?
You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.
I SHOULD have been -
Captain, perhaps we're going about this the wrong way; our job is to get to the conference; HER job will be to stop us.
But we haven't run out of history just yet.  Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - "the undiscovered country"...
Control tower, reading, Sir.
Gorkon's own man??
Uhura?
How did you - ?
Any progress?
In nineteenth century France, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines, flung their wooden shoes - called SABOTS - into the gears to stop them. Hence the word SABOTAGE.
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
I have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port --
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
That could take hours!
They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.
They're naturally wary, ma'am. We've been at war a long time.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains - however improbable - must be the truth.
And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it "Plasma" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.
They might as well arrest me, too; I felt like Lieutenant Saavik.
Do you know where you are?
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.
Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing.
A weapon.
Geordi equipped me with the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit. I recommend you use it to return to the Enterprise.
What do you imagine this is?
We are losing dorsal shields.
I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten.
Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.
Counselor.
It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
I'm going to miss you.
Captain -- I might have a way to find them.
I'm only half human.
He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you.
No.
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.

That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
Deanna, on my mark.
Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors.
New Praetor?
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
I won't do it.
Worf, prepare a full phaser spread, zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.
What's this?
I think it's worth a look. Don't worry, Number One, we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare.
Sir --
But she's not the Enterprise.
But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.
We need to talk, just you and I.
And when I was ready they were going to replace you with me, an exact biological duplicate. Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet to.influence your command structure. It was a bold plan.
Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... youd be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would.
After you, Praetor.
So I'm not as tall as you expected?
Hello, Jean Luc.
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.
That's your life... not mine.
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
Intruder alert!
Are we prepared?
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
What can I do for you folks?
You have one with two beds?
Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.
Make any money?
What do you think of America?
Where did you stop last?
What was your last stop?
Where's that?
None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...
Contain it and get back to me.
George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
Hello George.
I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you.
Then you're going to have to do it without me.
George... Do you hear me, George?
Mrs. Haydn...
Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
Please...
Steering wheel...
What?!
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...
Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
No gas.
Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I?  Who are you?
Are you from up there? Space?
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
In your pocket, please...
I want to try it.
What's the matter?
Horses.
What?
I will see it next time.
That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
No... The closest...
Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
What happened?
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
What are you doing?
Do you have music up there?
I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?
The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?
You can have one.
I will go. But not you.
I don't want you to be hurt.
Where are you going?
No one's traveling in this weather.
Good morning.
You don't forget anything, do you?
Hello... hello. How are you this morning?
They are beautiful.
This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
I'm sure we could find a country and western station.
There.
The yellow one.
Tell the baby about me.
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
Help me!!!
Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...
You sure this is your car?
I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
This is crazy. What were we going to do if that had been the ship? We have two thirty calibre machine guns, three M16's and some handguns.
I know. She bought him a ticket for Lathrop Wells and put him on the bus. He didn't stay on though and they drove off together.
Tell him I'm not here.
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
This has always been my favorite time of day.
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive.
Bullshit politics.
Superconducting QUantum Interference Device.  SQUID.  Got it?  There's gonna be a test.
You said you were going to get her out of this.
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
What's going on?
No.
Talk to me about costs, here.
Naw.  She won't call me.
See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--
Let's work it.
Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
Faith OK?
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
You just did.
So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.
Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.
Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.
Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
So lay it off to somebody else.
Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'.
I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all...
Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
I always do.
Charm.
Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a big night.  Can't you feel it?  The energy in the air?  There's money to be made, dreams to sell.
Just a couple of hours.  It'll be fun--
What's his name?
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
What is it?
And gives it to you.
And what about the guy that was following me?
What is it?
Shit!
I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.
There's a plus side?
It was a tough call.
The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
That's the original.  There are no copies.
We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.
Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
Was this him?
No.
Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
Welcome back, sir. How was the vacation?
Agent Duncan, there's an interstate issue up on 54, run out there.
You run the plates?
Her name is Karen Sumpter, from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished.
Who knows.
Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
How did you know he was a construction worker?
Speck's the killer all right. We got box loads of evidence. Did 'em all the same way: torture, strangulation. Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count.
Mackelway, I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.
Miss me, Dave?
When I was at the rest stop, there was a young boy, maybe ten, and his mother. Darryl Hawkins, Zero, abducted the boy in the men's room. I tried to stop him. He cold-cocked me --
Thanks for the ride.
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
This is a sexy case.
Some kids found you in a garbage dump.
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
Taking a Stryker saw, cutting off the top of someone's cranium, pulling the brain out -- what's that, a day in Spring?
I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
I saw him on a talk show once, talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims, not the families of the victims, he doesn't talk about them. Blood money, that's what it is.  Did he hit on you?
When you were his student? Did he come on to you?
I've been thinking about this.
He's called a couple times.
Just routine stuff.
The tattoo?
Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.
That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.
That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.
You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.
Jaime --
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.
How did you know Speck was a killer?
Who are you?
I don't carry it with me.
Hum a tune and I'll sing to it.
There's someone out there, Mack, I know, some man killing for the fun of it, sniffing human glue, without regard to age or sex, without predicable M.O. Someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. You have access, you can call up local authorities, check morgues, conduct interviews. Be my man.
We're alike. We are hunters. We have the gift. It's ancient times all over again. We stand between order and chaos. I need help. I can't carry on alone.
This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]
I want to go live with you.
Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.
I believe it's in my file, sir.
You've been through worse.
Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
Thanks.
Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas...
Like the quiche?
Well, I left someone very special behind.
You too?
Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
They're out of Glenlivet.
Always...
Lisa works at the MGM Grand...
I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
You said there are advantages to being single. I want to know what the advantages are.
I'll have to come see you sometime.
...well, it suits you...
Hello?
Lorraine?
Yeah, hold on.
Hi, Lorraine. Thanks for holding on.
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
And what if I don't want to give up on her?
But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her.
So I don't call either way.
So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
I didn't mention her once today.
The only reason I mentioned her at all is to say that I'm not going to talk about her anymore. I thought you'd appreciate that.
I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
Oh, like that song...
There are so many beautiful women here.
I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?
I think I'm gonna move Back East.
Then why won't she call...?
You miss the pain?
How's it going for you two?
Big butt... you know, can't fly coach.
...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
Vegas, baby!
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
That's not cool.
You're gonna screw up our plan.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
Mikey's the big winner.
What an asshole.
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...
...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...
Baby, you did fine.
No, man. I need to use the phone.
She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?
Sorry about interrupting...
Christy was nice...
She didn't like me, anyway.
I don't think so.
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
That was different.
Don't remind me.
Selling scrap metal.
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
You guys are such assholes.
...the Copa, in New York...
Which one?
You looked right at her, baby.
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
Now?
It's on.
...and you got big claws and fangs...
Definitely. Two days. That's the industry standard...
Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party.
...Anaheim...
It's on...
...Okay, two...
Beautiful. What time are you off...  ...Christy?
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
No.  You ask for too much.
Godfather!
You're staying home.  You're not going out.
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?
You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
Outside.
You think we'll go for that last place?
I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend.
All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work.
When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
And now, what do you choose to do?
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.
Things went badly in Palermo?
What is it?
You tell us about America.
Hey, beautiful girls!
You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight. 
Who are those girls?
Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him.
Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies?
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
We should hear what they have to say.
Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal...
We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks.  I want to get things going good before he gets better.  What's the matter with you?
Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You should call...
What was that?
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?
What will your father say?
Hello.  Kay?
I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father.  What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.
Most important...I want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life.
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
The Corleone family wants to buy me out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy me out.
The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!
I have to go back to New York tomorrow.  Think of your price.
You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?
Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
You like jazz!
Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat --
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
Where do we find a carozza for the Forum, or can we hire any of them -- ?
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.
Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?
She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?
Why?
I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums?
I wanted to tell you my plan.
What?
Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.
Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.
Hello?
I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.
Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
Tom.
I'm going to take Marge for a little walk, Tom. Mr MacCarron wants to talk with you.
Okay.
You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem.
Dickie, you can't even drive a car! No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life.
I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me?
Are you okay?
Hello Marge.
I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.
Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited...
How long's he staying for?
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
That's a terrific idea.
Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me.
What?
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
I told you! I knew it!
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
Dickie, my God!
I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...
So -- are you travelling under R?
Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore Roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
Hello. What are you up to?
Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic?
How much for everything.
How much to get a permit to carry?
You like ball games?
I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box.
Is that so?  But what do you think of Charles Palantine?
Well, we're all working tonight.
All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.
You're right! Now I remember! It was after the Western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late. The next day I was completely bushed. It was unbelievable.
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
No, no, please. This fare's on me. Please.
Travis?
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
Oh, are you all right?
No, why?
First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
First she did her make-up. You know, I hate it when they do that. I mean she does the whole works, the mascara, the eye-shadow, the lipstick, the rouge...
Yeah.
She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? But she stiffed me. A real skunk.
Yeah. We went to Harvard together. 
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
Well, if there's this many hackies inside, there must be lots of fares outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em.
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
I have.
Why? Who are you?
I don't remember.
But you're the one that wanted to get away. You're the one that came into my cab.
Do they drug you?
Listen...
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane -- that's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or busted. I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went. I stayed here.
Why not?
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
You a narc?
What should I do? Call the cops?
Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
I sure hate to go alone...
Why should it be grounded?
Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?
Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
Travis, what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most?
There's porno theatres for that.
You kiddin? Who else would hack through South Bronx or Harlem at night?
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
Some. Here and there.
Look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.
Anything you say, officer.
I'm no cop.
How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?
Get it.
What's the action around?
Yeah.
Like do anything, you know.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Could we change the subject?
Spit it out.
God's speed.
This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?
I believe you.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
What about you, Delly?
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger?
Dad?
How'd it go?
Do you... remember me?
Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed?
Right here.  "Albert Lucas Trumbo." And all the others.  I knew them all.  So did you.  We went to school with most of them.
What did... what did I want to be?
Nine hundred...
What about a loan?  You could go to the bank...?
Huh.  That was nice of me.
Now, did you remember that, or...
How do you tell those two apart, anyway?
Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
Yes... yes, I do.
All right, Mr. Appleton.  That was what you knew then.  What do you know now?
Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
Cecil!  Cecil, there's a young man in there...
Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
Nine and-a-half years ago.
That's Lily.  Your mother, rest her soul.
This is the staff of the Bijou.
But I...
Carl.  Friend of yours from high school.  Everybody calls him "Cueball."
I'll be home in a little while, Harry.  Don't wait up.
Well...
And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make.  What are those?
Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
Pete... go home.  Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy?
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
That's where you live.
You kids off to the dance?
Take a hike.  Am-scray.
Peter, their hands are tied.  You see that, don't you?
Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is.  "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters.  Now, did you go to any meetings?
Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
I know.  A Purple Heart.
They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them.  They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all.
Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist.  Now, are you gonna play ball?
Exactly.
Cigarette?
Sit.  Play with me.
Cat.  That's simple.  I like it.  Hi, Cat.
I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. He died in the war.  He's not coming back, and I'm not him.  I don't even belong here.  This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is.  An accident.
Pete, there's time before the picture starts, you want to get some popcorn?
What happened?
Said as much myself, Doc.  Can't place him, though.  To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker.  Well, morning's half-over.  I'm off.
Miss Hayworth?
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
Oh, hi!  Did you find her all right?
It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it.
Miss Daniels? Is that you?
Thank you.
Or would you rather I changed the subject?
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
And the second?
Do you think I should go?
Mother!
Mom, they're in a cage!
Is smoking fun?
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
No, it's Lois!
See them two big trees across there?
It's a surprise, you see.
I wonder if you could tell me...
I need her exact name, you see.
How much for the phone calls?
I don't see what difference it makes, Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If they attacked the school, that's pretty serious.
I didn't even know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of year.
Why not, Mrs. Bundy?
Deke, have you got a first aid kit back there?
A what?
Oh. I see.
There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
I don't know. We'll break up the furni...
Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?
If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
Where's Mitch?
Then he saw.
Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do.  I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man.  But...  You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone.  I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset.  I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.
That's the last of it.
Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
Does this room look silly?
Well, where did he go?
Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?
No, of course not.
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
How?
We never met in court or anyplace else.
When?
I think you're a louse.
What kind of law?
Ouch!
I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
Right next to the one you already had.
With... with Annie, of course.
I'm sure.
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
I'll take Cathy up to bed.
Of birds?
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
What do you mean?
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
I think it's safe to get out now.
Have we still got power?
Where are they heading?
The power.
I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels.  You see, he hasn't arrived yet.
Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
That... that... who was that?
Yes, certainly. 
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?
Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish.
Something like this happened in Santa Cruz last year. The town was covered with seagulls.
I'm Donald Fettes.
You asked to see me, ma'am?
I'm only a student.
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
He could have been a great man -- a good man and a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back -- and always Gray -- Gray to hound him to his death.
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
Dr. MacFarlane --
But you did promise.
Fettes, the more things are wrong, the more we must act as if everything were right. You must do with Joseph as you did with, the street singer -- complete dissection -- a proper entry in the book --
What do you mean, Fettes?
Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows.  We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.
This is not a woman!
Are you a doctor, too?
What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?
I set those blocks together, patched the muscles. I put the nerves where they should be -- I did it and I did it right -- and she won't walk --
I would make you rich.
A pleasure to torment me?
I presume you shall.  This won't be my last visit here.
"A good-day to you Madame Tosspot, and would you like a little glass of something before you take your rest? Come with me to my house and I'll make you my guest. You shall have quarts to drink if you like."  Ah, how he cozened them.
How long ago?
I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
You've been with Gray again.
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?
Check and mate.
Think maybe knives do?
You're him! You're Corvis! We fried your ass. You're dead, man!
Fucking Zombie.
I heard you were looking for this.
The scar. Which of you has it?
You're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? You almost sound like him.
... it connects you to me...
I thought we had an understanding. I thought we understood that discretion is paramount.
They botched the execution.
Look, can I just call a cab?
It still doesn't mean...
I think I dropped an earring.
You killed her!
It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.
We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.
One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake.  You mentioned a demonstration of force--
Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.
Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.
We sure had fun today. We saw the space ship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt -- and--
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
Now think back hard. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You haven't even been out of the house.
Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?
Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.
You think they'll ever find him?
What does that mean?
Did all these people die in wars?
Go to the movies.
I don't believe it.
The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. We all feel--
You must have come a long way.
Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.
We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?
You know about the United Nations?
Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
I've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr. Carpenter.
Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
Mr. Carpenter, I--  Goodnight.
Oh -- hello--
I want to know what he told you last night.
Why not?
Where are you going now?
It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.
Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
Is it worth anything?
You sure about that?
No -- no, thanks.
Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.
But I suppose you know the answer.
Your name's Carpenter -- that right?  Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?
How do you like Santa Carla?
All day.
Shut up!
Did you see that sucker burn?!
Two down and two to go.
We still going?
We were gonna grab some food.
Where's Star, David?!
I said, <u>I'll take you there</u>. Nobody's going near Star without me.
I had the dream again about <u>them</u>.
You didn't tell David?
You like Michael.
Wait a minute, kiddo.
Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.
Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!
Tell them to get something to eat.
Oh, no.  Now what?
So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy?  We've got it all.  Best selection in Santa Carla.
-- a job.
Say hello to Thorn.
Not impressed, are you?
This looks terrific, Lucy.
He doesn't walk all over me.
I am?
But you passed the test!
Hi...
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
I guess you're new around here.
I wouldn't have given my Mom such a hard time about moving here if I'd known I was going to meet you.
Why not?
You've got to put this on.
Huh?
I'm making you a sandwich.
Michael?
What happened, Michael!?
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
All right... Box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol.
What do you mean "got" to the dog?
That night?
How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean?
What the hell you looking at me like that for?
Couldn't make much of it myself.
Sure.  You think there's a connection?
Look, I know it's hard to believe...
Listen to me, Garry.  Please...
How you doin', old boy?
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me.  But...
I said where?  Where'd you go?!
Cut that out, Copper.  Nauls?  What's taking you?!
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
MacReady!
And if anyone tries to wake me...
How long will it take you to prepare this?
I'm getting worried about you.  You ought to have a checkup.
After all this mess then.
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
Right.  Why not?
Hey, man...!
Put that down!
How's that Thing get to the dogs?  I though we stopped it in time.
Where were the flashlights?
We've got to find Fuchs.  When we find him -- we kill him.
What about Childs?
You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
We should sleep in shifts.
Yeah!
It's got into the pub!  It's turned on the stereo!
It's in between us and them!!  How we going to get back?!
It must have been hard, leaving your work.
... Thousands and thousands of people.  And sometimes we live in great buildings that reach up five or ten stories.
She didn't want me to be a climber. She wanted me to be a planner like her.
No one ever comes here.  My mother told me stories about it late at night.  They tell all the children.
Right up your alley, I would think. You are from the past, yes?
Sir... have you a name?
Please, we need your help.  The Morlocks have taken --
You know of them?
Do you know where they live?
Because you'll never die.
So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you?  See all the mysteries exposed?
Send him home.  You don't want him to see it.
My God... I saw this.
Yes...
So, do we go on?
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
Machines?
What's it all for?
Alexander... Listen to me, it was wrong to bring you.  You're not going to find what you're looking for.
And centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again, we couldn't.  Our adaptation was too successful.  We survived... we endured... for this.
What?
Say I just come back again?
If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger...
That was a foolish thing to do.
It's spectacular...
I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
Dance with me...
Talk away, Professor.
Admiration?  My my.
Oh dammit, I love you!  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.
Alex, what is it?
Why do we have to race for heaven's sake?!
My God...
Now I know you're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget.
Let them.
Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.
I'm sorry, David.
What happened to Emma will never go away.  It's part of you now and it always will be.  But you have to learn to live with it...
David... I appreciate your concern, I do.  But I ask you to have faith in me.  Just for a little while longer.  I'm working on something now.  Something... extraordinary.
I can't do that --
And this would be my study.  There was an elm tree outside the window then.
This... was my home.
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
How long did you travel?
Kalen will tire you out if you let him.  He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.
I'm going to sit with Kalen.  Keep the fire burning if you can.
You seem fascinated by the stars.
Don't then have stars where you come from?
It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
... It was a great city.  The greatest city in the world.
Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
Alexander...?
This is where my journey started... right here.
You've welcomed me into your home. Into your lives.  Everyone has... For the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much.  I thank you for that.
Mara -- what -- ?!
Oh huzzah, the master's home.
And roosters.
"Eloi"?
Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
He said he traveled for two months.
Oh, very different.  But not entirely... I mean we have lots of, um, trees and such.  But not everywhere.  And more roads.  And buildings.
Good morning, Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?
We have to go after them, find where -- !
What do you mean?!
How did you get hurt?
I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.
I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.
You ok?
Well, your condition's pretty serious.
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
Yes.
[Beat] You're his son?
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
Jackie, go play in the snow.
But I like it I guess.
What for?
What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything.
No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days.
Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?
I've been ok.
How you doin'?
How?
And if I didn't want to come?
No. I don't want it to.
I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?
I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?
You told me this was how it happened.
He's having absence [pronounced "absance"] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly.
What were you talking about the other day?
It's gonna be sticky.
You ever been to jail?
Can you drive?
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
I'm not sure.
[Beat] Yeah, I'm fine.
What's this?
You want a drink?
I guess not. But, as of now, I never knew either.
How?
Have a good day at work today.
Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night.  You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
Honey?
Who's the nut?
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
You're gettin' in deeper every moment you're gone.
No!
You know, certain words and phrases just keep floating through my mind, things like incarceration, cavity search, life imprisonment, death by electrocution, that sort of thing. So, come out alive?  I don't know. Let us think about that.
Alright.
I have no problem with that.
Is this the guy you saw them with?
Good God.
Hey!  Don't let them shoot those girls.  This is too much.  They got guns pointed at 'em!
Your name's Harlan?  I got an uncle named Harlan!
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
That sounds nice.
What did ya do?
I've always believed if done right, armed robbery doesn't have to be a totally unpleasant experience.
Jimmy!  Hello, stranger.  What in the world are you doin' here?
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
And what's the mysterious code word?
Okay, peaches, okay.  But can I ask you one thing?
Does it have something to do with another guy?  Are you in love with him?
Are you just doin' this to punish me?
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
Thelma!
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little girls' room, and then we gotta hit the road.
Oh my God.
Shit!  I... I, which way?
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
We gotta be inconspicuous.  Do you know what that means?
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
I... I don't know.  I don't know what you're askin' me.
Will I be?
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.
Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  You're making a spectacle.
Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!
For the first time in my life, I wish this car wasn't green.
You think you've found your calling?
Ugh!!  Why do they have to do that?
Fill her up.  There's a phone right over there.
How'd they find out we're going to Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?
I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up.  I asked him not to tell.  I didn't think he would tell anybody.
Now what?
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy.
I am really sorry about this.
Louise... are we still going to Mexico?
What'd I say again?
What?
I said all that?
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
You know what's happened, don't you?
We've gone insane.
Shit!
What?!  What d'you think?!
I guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty.
You're a good friend.
Hi!
Yeah... sure did.
Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted?
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
Gay? He said you were gay?
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.  You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.
Nah.
I mean since then.
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
And you think he could find out her number for me?
Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health...  I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment.
No You mean...?
How the hell did you get here anyway?
And this adversely affects me how...?
Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know if I'm ready for this, man.
This is a good one, Mare. Sounds like his partner's all lubed up.
Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?
Very nice.
Nineteen months I been sober.
Here, just have one of these then.
Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back in a couple hours, I'm still staking out this girl's apartment.
Oh yeah.
Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
I know he's around here someplace.
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
That grandmother of yours -- she's really something.
I guess.
Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and roses... and I'm really happy. Leave a message. BEEP.
Any idea where I might start looking?
Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. Now I want you to level with me: Did you knock this skirt up?
You want her dead, don't you?
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
You bet.
Among others.
I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else.  My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
That stalkin' son-of-a-bitch!
Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face
I see where you're going.
I don't know, it was complicated. He's in San Francisco, I'm in Miami.  Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him.
Have you been up all night again?
You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
Good lookin'?
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
Holy shit...
Pat does projects all over the world.
You don't think they're too big?
Uh, well... not exactly. You see, I exaggerated a little there.
Hi, Ted.
Sure.
Twenty-two.
Nitrate-sicles -- I like that.
Ted... you're not that far ahead.
Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?
Ted...?
But but what about Steve?
Is it the frank or the beans?
One guess.
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
Now I've seen it all. What the hell were you thinking?
Well, there's only one thing to do.
Uh-huh.
We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?
How are you doing, Warren?
Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, Mr. President. We're tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. There's no sign they're changing course. The closest ships, the Gagarin and the Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow.
This private assurance represents the word of the Highest Authority?
With the caveat that it is not made public in any way, shape or form.  And we must have an answer tomorrow at the latest. I cannot stress this point enough.
Lying bastard. Lied to my face.
Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
My father --
Slow down. Smell that?
What did you think of Lippman's column this morning?
Jack and Bobby are good men. But it takes a certain character, moral toughness to stand up to --
Every day the sun comes up... says something about us.
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
And the second condition?
How long until the army is ready?
Does this attack on our plane represent a definitive, intentional escalation on the part of the Soviets?
Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.
I want an hour with him.
It's Tuesday. You said to call. When do I get my 45 minutes?
There are major rail disruptions in the South, two airborne divisions are on alert. That exercise is an invasion.
Secretary of Defense...
I guess you won't be coming home tonight.
So what've we got today?
I'm not calling and canceling on Daly. You call and cancel on Daly.
We have to try the blockades. It probably won't work. It may just be delaying the inevitable. But we can't just go to war without trying not to.
All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...
I'm your political advisor, and I'm giving you political analysis here. This is a setup. The Chiefs want to go in. It's the only way they can redeem themselves for the Bay of Pigs. They have to go in, and they have to do it right. It's that simple.
It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.
Bob, is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first?
Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
They're going to kill me next. That's what I hear. These new Indians are destroying everything. Our people are a quiet people.
South Dakota...  Did I do something unsatisfactory, Sir?
Hey, hey, hey. J. Edgar would've loved you. He'd love anybody who joined the bureau to, what was it? "To enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests"?
Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure.
This is a restricted area.
Leo has to take the journey, Cooch.
Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.
That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.
Genetic ditto on evidence found at the site with evidence you found in his belongings. An incontrovertible motive. And definite footprints on Jimmy Looks Twice at Maisy Blue Legs house.
Jesus, you alright?
Listen: when we get back tomorrow, you're gonna find Tully laying a promotion on you. S.A.C. He wants to prove that his yuppie agents are making good. He's offering you New York. Tell him you want Atlanta.
This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent Levoi. There is classified information pertaining to our national security. You don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. Jesus Christ --
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.
What did he say?
What did he say?
What was he saying?
The old man saw an owl. Over there in the dry wash. Last week.
The owl told him about Leo. That's incredible. I guess we just broke the back of this investigation, didn't we? Evidence doesn't get any harder than that -- not for my money. Is there anyway we can seduce this owl into Federal Court?
Was-te. 'Cept for one thing. Jimmy Looks Twice was nowhere near there. Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years old, his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near Elk Mountain.
Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic.
Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.
Not no more.
Why? So you can get rid of me, too?
Where was this?
You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty.
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?
1868...
A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
I desecrated it?
Your relatives must've taught you something.
Do you want a coffee?
I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think --
Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.
Not for long, Richard. You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver.
No way. No fuckin' way.
Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.
I thought he'd never leave.
You saw a MiG 21?
Where did you see that?
It never came up.
Yes. I'll give you that!
What if he's not?
What about the plane?
Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it.
I'm different.
Let's make it at eight.
It dies. We live.
That's true. What are you?
You don't have to kill it.
What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
You want to go ballistic?
I want it understood.
Just good luck.
...they say you're alright.
That's not what I hear.
Where are we?
What do you do when you come here?
You say the truth.  Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?
Off me or off you?
And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until I can think of a new career...hotel management or something...
Yes sir. I do, Sir.
Yes, Sergeant?
I've got a six strobe.  I think he's locked on us.
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to put it down.
If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!
BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! FLARES!
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?
No! Not again!
3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
You're not supposed to...
Why do you all have such funny names?
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
So I've heard.
Tom Kazansky.
What was that?
Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?
Great move. Great
Ahhh...A little high on the left, don't you think?
It's a victory roll.
Hi...Hi there. How ya doing in there?  Mav... Ahhh...you know, at one point I did want a Navy career.
1000.
A plaque?
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
Figured it out yet?
He just won't engage. He can't do it, Skipper. He can't get back on the horse.
You didn't help.
It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "CNC" --course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.
They waved him off. He thought he knew better. He hit the ramp.
Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
Need a ride?
Shut up and drive!
Would you like the same suite?
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
Now let's get down to business.  Kuato wants what's in Quaid's head.  And he might be able to get it, cause they say he's psychic.  Now I have a little plan to keep this from happening.  --Do you think you can play along?
I say we throw the switch and see what happens.
Bob?
Oh shit....Oh shit...
Two-headed monsters?
So, been married long?
Your sexual orientation?
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
Suppose I do...then what?
What is it?
Pull them out.
Sit down.
You're Kuato, right?
They found us!  Everybody out!
Yeah.
I don't know.  Maybe.
Hey, Quaid!
Where?
Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?
Lori...
Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?
Harry from work...He was the boss.
You call this a paranoid delusion?!
Not talk!  I said TALK!!
You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?
And falling in love?
O.K. then.  If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?
I suppose you're not here either.
Nooo!  I would never do anything to hurt you.  I want you to come back to me.
Then I can pull this trigger, and it won't matter.
As real as any memory in your head.
Secret agent...How much is that?
I love you.
Hauser?  You're Hauser.
Hauser, you're lost your mind.
This is too weird.
Not bad, for a hooker.
You sure about this?
The whole core of Mars is ice.  The reactor melts it and releases oxygen.
Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.  She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things.
You stupid punk!  You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
What do <u>you</u> use it for?
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
I can't believe it.  No tracks, no sign, no spoor.
Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!
She's got my vote.
Jesus Christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.
Well, we can take my truck then.
Where the hell are they?  Hope they didn't wise up.
Nothing.  But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
Tammy Lynn Baxter.
So what if we just did it...today. Pack up.  Drive straight down to Bixby.  Get serious.
She's got us.  Now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in Perfection.
We did it!  We faced temptation and we did not bend!
So long, cactus!
Oh, Jesus!!
Jesus!  I don't <u>believe</u> this!
Slick as snot and I'm not lying.
Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.
Shut up!  They got wind of something they don't like!
You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here.
Shut it up!  Shut the little bastard up!
Well...that's it.  We're not getting off this rock...
What the hell are you doing?!!
Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
Well, what's wrong with it?
Rhonda's got an idea about that.
What's it doing?
Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be <u>some</u> way!
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
It worked!  There they go!
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
The photo on the left shows the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin, true?
Ms. Vin's sister.
Don't hurt him.
Objection, your Honor! The fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial!
Objection.
Oh really?
Not the whole time, of course. I --
-- a speed manufacturer --
-- Listen: "November 5, 1980. Cecil Stipe walked into 5th Precinct. Says he witnessed Chin shooting, saw suspect's picture in Post. Says Shu Kai Kim wrong man."
They're just frightened, fucked-up losers that prison fucked up worse.
-- What?
Eddie... it's one thing to compare Clyde Gruner to Jesus Christ. It's even okay to claim that Shu Kai Kim is just slightly holier than the Pope... as long as you don't really believe it!
You're carrying that around like it was a picture of your girlfriend!  I don't want to see your heart broken when this case crashes and burns!
Eddie -- it's Art Esparza!
They could've been brothers. It's why the eyewitnesses picked Shu.
"The killer wasn't Chinese"... Cecil Stipe was right. .!
You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs?
Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
Start looking into the Joe Boys -- who assigned the hits in 1980, what rank generally did the hits...  Your extensive law enforcement contacts should be of some use.
So there goes your theory about the Joes giving up Shu to protect their trigger man.
-- Find him?
I haven't paid you.
No. You tell me, Shu.
No.
...I'm dying out there.
When the D.A. hears I filed the writ, he'll send someone here, maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful, Cecil, okay? To all of us?
Of course you know Dean Rabin, one of my Assistant D.A.s. Dean generally handles nuisance cases like the... what's the man's name?
You won't remember this, but in '72 I was one of several prosecutors assigned to the Black Panther-Police Shootout.  We had a whole team, and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt.  So what've you been up to since then?
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
I'll prosecute anyone who fucks up. If that makes me look racist, it's a trade-off I'll live with, Ed.
-- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?
Did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?
Lou Sklaroff, Vin Badalato, Dave Montell.
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
I followed you here from court.
...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
Mr. Ortega, you've known the defendant at Ossining Correctional for how long?
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
Mr. Ortega, what is Shu Kai Kim's rank within La Compania?
And why was an exception made?
No... No, go away.
This isn't Mike.  Is this Mike?
Bobby's got it.
Well, where are you going?
Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.
What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
Did you know Teresa Banks?
OK, Gordon.
Congratulations. I heard about that.
Agent Chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time. He had me drive the van with the body back here. Which we did. It was 105 miles.
I cracked the Whiteman case with this.
Where is the ring?
That would indicate that it's the future.
Had the FBI here once before. Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place.
No.
Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister.
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
That was really something.  That dancing girl.  What did it mean?
Lil was wearing a sour face.
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. Where are we going to sleep?
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
She lived alone.
James called me last night looking for you.
Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.
Yes, James is very sweet. Why don't you get out your violin, Donna?
Maybe I better start our homework.
This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
Where are you going?
Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?
I won't wear your stuff.  I promise.
You missed somethin', Ed.
Bob.
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
No "Jacques". I am the Great Went.
Laura, do you love me?
You're not a turkey. A turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
Shit, maybe he'll kill you.
Bobby killed a guy.
Johnny, Johnny... let your Daddy and your Uncle and Leland talk.  Ben... Leland, we can play the French against the Norwegians. What do the French love more than anything?
You're getting warmer.
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
Can I take the car?
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
Dad... Dad... Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him?
Oh, I thought I saw you.
I always thought you knew it was me.
Hello, Laura. Hello Sarah. Where's my axe?  "I'm hungry".
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
Four cases in three years...
We thought it was just.
What is the truth?
...he wants to testify...?
This is going to drive the ante up.
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
Just now...
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed...?
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
Orthopedics?
...of Anesthesiology?
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins...
Well, many reasons, actually...
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
Dr. Thompson...?
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.
I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
I... in that small context I would have... I would have to say 'no.'
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
She getting good care over there?
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.' General textbook on the subject. Is that correct?
And you wrote that...
I appreciate -- a man as busy as --
Yes.
Kathy Price...
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
What did she say?
A single hour.
That's it...?  Come on, guys... life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.  Frank: I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand... and that's a lot of money... and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out... They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case. Now this is it today.
I changed my life today. What did you do?
Why?
What Hotel are you staying at?
I'm a lawyer.
A brick house says you divorced him. I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner. And I'll take your word for it. Now you tell me the truth. Because you cannot lie to me. What's your name?
My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists. The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh? But to give them a chance at justice.
They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'
I've got to work...
Do you think it's my fault?
You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself?
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
You're pressuring yourself...
What are you going to do?
Mr. Galvin's...
I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin... why didn't you go in?
It's not a good case. It's a very good case.
We just can't do it anymore.  This is our chance to get away.
What does it mean?  I... I mean we, you have other tactics...
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
So what?
John: gimme a cuesta-ray.
Yeah? How's our new witness?
Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness?
She told me.
Dr. Towler...
...of the procedures...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.  And they resume seven minutes...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
Looks almost cold now, don't it?
Yeah.  No sense stayin' out here.
It's no meteor, that's for sure!
Hey, how about that!
There's nobody left around here now.
Hurry up!  Jump in!
Is that it over there?
You seem to know a lot about him.
Well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get-up!  But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach Library Science over at USC.
Where are we?
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
I've been as close to them as anyone. But not close enough for real observation...
I stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me.  It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
Nothing there now.
This Martian blood...  Let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got!
That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  You fellers'll have to figure it out.  You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.
They don't do much of anything...!
Number three to. D.O....Number three to D.O.
And since you've been thinking of making it.  Has anything funny happened?
It was nothing.  We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  Terry and Chuck were...hurt.  You were almost...  You were even cut.
Heather?
Heather, I'm stuck here.  Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.  I can't get away!
Like Freddy.
Dylan?  He's holding well.  Earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...
He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
I want my kid out of here now!
Someone's coming.
"...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.  'We will bake cookies first,' she said.  'I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough.  Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside."  Dylan, this is too violent.  I don't know why you like these stupid old tales.
Okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep tight.
Why does God let there be bad things?
Hurry back, please.  I'm sleepy.
Dylan, where's the man?
Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.
Everything went great, I thought.  We really got you, didn't we?
I know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted.  I just can't believe it's him.  I mean, and not something outside, influencing him.  Or is that how denial works?
You didn't jump in.
Really?
John Saxon.  Do you have any idea what time it is?
You got it.  What's happening?
Holy...
Heather Langenkamp?
Heather, what is it?
Then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?
Isn't there anyone that can stop him?
Did we lose anybody?
Looks like weather.
He would have loved this.
Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars?
Because we believed we could make an impact out here.  Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing.
Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's just striking out at the world.
We'll bear off to port and run down wind.
Come in.
But your instinct was to lose sail?
There's still a way.
I thought we'd find a store, get you fixed up and then get you some lunch.  That sound good?
What the "Bowsprit Affair"?
Yeah.
Where you going?
Yeah, that's right.  You wanna come in and shake it for me?
They were gonna put me into special- ed this year.  I stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. Shit, who am I kidding.  I'll never pass the boards.
Bregitta.  Do you believe it?
You okay?
That we're going back.  I don't want it to end.  I don't want to be what I was when I left.
He does.
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
Can we talk?
Is it true Phil?
You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
But that's not the point...
Honey, did you know that the Albatross was captured by the Germans during World War II?
I'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  I guess that's what I thought it would be out here.  But, it's not is it?
No way!
My parents don't do it anymore.
Where are you from any way?
It was so real...
Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.
Uh, huh.
Shouldn't we turn away?
The Dolphin was a symptom.
But you invited is aboard.
But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
What is it we can do for you today?
Oh, really?
I need to know what I'm working with; what their boundaries are. Their lives depend on it, and for that matter so does yours.  We've got to bring them together.  Make them a crew.  We're as strong as our weakest link and I don't want to find that out the hard way.  So, I will challenge them and they will come together.
What?!  What's happening?!!
Jesus!  What the hell happened to him.
What's your problem?
That's not a satisfactory answer.
What's wrong Mr. Lawford.
About yourself?
What are we supposed to talk about?
Phil.  What are you doing?
You're a day late.  We keep a schedule aboard ship.  Lives depend on it.  Hello, Philip.
Suicidal...
Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear.  Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch.  Everyone else hit the racks.
What's it going to be?
You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
Are you hating this?!  Are you!
They are much more than that, sir.
There are allegations questioning your competence with regard to the command of the Albatross.  I have been instructed to convene a formal tribunal to determine whether or not negligence played a part in the sinking.
The families... want your ticket. Turn it in, we forget the whole thing.  Everybody goes home.
Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".
Everybody knows why she went over Tod.  You jibed the boat.
Yes, ma'am. What's on your almost- perfect mind this evening?
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
I can dig this music... But not that singer.
I'd just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one, if it's same to you.
What's Cao Ben?
Hey, pretty woman... Sailor here?
Need a hand?
How 'bout a beer?
Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well.
I been studyin' a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it.
I don't particularly care for that kind of talk, Bobby.
...But DAMN man... This better go smooth.
What's she doin' here?
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.
What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
It's none of my business, but when are you and Marietta gonna tie the knot? I always wondered why you never did.
No big buildings like in New Orleans.
I'm sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd, but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl.
Only that it's supposed to be a pretty poor sight since the hurricane came through last year.
Hasta siempre.
What?
What is it, Johnnie?
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
What brand'd she smoke?
Gee, Sailor. I'm sorry, honey. I never would have guessed it.
I'd stand by you, Sailor... through anything.
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?
Uncle Pooch came in the side door through the porch, you know? Where I was makin' a jelly and banana sandwich? I remember I had my hair in curlers cause I was goin' that night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the DeSoto sisters. Uncle Pooch must have known nobody but me was home, cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter.
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?
I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.
When she got almost to the top step I stuck my hand between her legs from behind.
That's just what she said. I had a boner with a capital "O." I went to kiss her but she broke off laughin' and ran down the hallway. I found her lyin' on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and Penthouse magazines. She was a wild chick. She was wearin' bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin' lacy black stripes down the sides. You know, them kind that doesn't go all the way down your leg?
I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... I guess this means you're breakin' parole, then?
M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i... You can almost hear that jazz blowin' up from the big N.O.
What's that, peanut?
Huh?
You got me, peanut.
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
The water was rollin' off me. And I was dirty, too, like I hadn't had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was black almost.
Sometimes dreams just don't mean nothin'... Stuff comes into your mind and you don't have no control over, you know? Anyways, dreams ain't no odder than real life. Sometimes not by half.
Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
You're scarin' me, baby.
Oh shit...
God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.
You upset with me?
I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...
They have, sugar.
Trust me on it.
Sailor?
Sailor? You know what?
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
Sail?
I mean tomorrow.
Who says I'm smart? You up to somethin' with Bobby Peru, Sailor?
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.
That man's a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, you'll regret it. If you live to.
What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
How can you say that, Sailor?
LULA!!!!
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
Mama, I'm hangin' up this phone now.
You're comin' home, precious. Santos' gonna drive us to the San Antonio airport.
I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.
Course I am, mama.
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
I'm afraid his car is gone, Mrs. Fortune.
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
What do you want me to do about it?
Take care of him?
Simple? Kill him? How?
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
Through the forehead?
Wrong! It's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head... right toward the bridge of the nose... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.
You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.
I'm gonna take your silence as a "yes"...
Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
I know... I remember.
I'll tell you the problem. You behind the wheel. There's your fucking problem.
What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.
Actually... I just want to go home.
He's fine. He's narrating.
Thank you.
Trip??
He is. Take my word for it.
You stay there.
You know -- based on what I've read -- this is a very exciting piece of material, this Big Parade.
Which is?
So modest.
Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
Kind of a sign, you're saying.
No. But I don't think that matters.
The last month maybe.
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
Is that in my chart?
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
Goodbye, Grady.
Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.
Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog.
He didn't give his name.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
But... ?
And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked out. I was asked to leave.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
It's not so bad. I know the night janitor. And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff.
A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
Isn't this...?
She seemed to take it pretty well.
It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a small town.
This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
It feels really... good... here.
Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.
You coming?
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
I'm not going with them.
And we both thank you for that, but we're... we're... fine.
I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's always carrying around. He must've left it inside.
All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa.
Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that aunt worked, do you? James' aunt.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?
Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission.
So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.
Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
Who's gun is that?
Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
I believe you. I believe you want to be with me. But this is not just about me anymore.
Someone stole my car.
I went and looked at some babies just now.
Oh?
What is it, Grady?
No.
Who's that guy?
Yo, Traxler.
Holy shit. Are you serious?
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about all this. I didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want you to know that.
Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious... Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.
Hardapple?
Are you riding with me, James?
George Sanders?
I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?
You doing okay?
Foreman now.
I'll never forget you got me started there.
Law says I can't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate. I figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty. Make a bet?
But maybe it's not so healthy being so close, you know, to a school.
Annette? She's good... tense.
I'm working on it.
I remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor Annette married." Except her brother. You treated me with respect.  Look, you paid your dues. Your slate is clean now.
Cherry.
Notice the grain. See how deep and rich the red runs?
It's my own design. You won't find another table like it in the world.
Then what? What?!
What's happening?
It's not what you think.
Nothing.
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
It's just a city park.
What are you writing in that book?
A pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends.
Cherry?
It's not for sale.
And when you sit by the window, watching the girls in the little cotton skirts parade by, do you wave your wanger at the girls? Is that when you jerk off?
You walked home.
You don't know?
He I.D.'d the assailant. The description matches you pretty well.
I'd say you're moving.
And your new apartment?
I'd keep away from him.
Just trying to be helpful.
People have the right to know.
A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy does.
But will he... ?
How do you know?
No.
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
Try it.
Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
How do you feel about that?
Is that what you are angry about?
Will I ever be normal?
Then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
You don't know!
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
Please don't do it again.
I'd like you to close your eyes.
Where?
Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?
What else?
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
You never spoke to me before.
Is that a school?
They could eat you.
So, you're not a dyke.
Hey, that was... intense.
Tell me about it.
Molested little girls?
You're not joking.
Look, you can go now.
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?
Get your kicks somewhere else.
What was prison like?
I'm sorry, Walter.
You really believe that?
I got poked around... here and there.
Maybe this isn't a good idea.
I don't even know how to live with myself.
Don't do that.
You okay?
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for me, right there.  That's it.
You done impressing yourself, ace?
Nice shot, Lins.
You never did like being called that, did you?
But what did he see that made him panic?
What's the scoop, ace?
Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will.
You dumb jarhead motherf--
I think it likes you.
Okay, I'm gonna free-swim to hatch six... get inside, get the door open from the other side.
You owe me one, Virgil.
Try again.
Alright, put this on.
Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple.
Look, it's three AM.  These guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep.  You better start cutting them some slack.
Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.
'Fish'?
Those guys ain't so tough.  I fought plenty of guys tougher'n them.
SHIT!
Copy that, continuing forward.  You just want me to get shots of everything, right?
1840... 50... 60... 70...
12000 feet.  Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this.
Getting a reading?
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.
These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all.
Somebody must live here!
Shall we go for a swim?
Find anything?
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
Yes, you should go.
But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me?
Promise that you won't try to look for me... you shouldn't try to look for me any more...
What is it, Claudia?
Why are you looking at me like that?
What are you saying?
Have you ever been in love?
But where did you finally end up?
I'm not coming.
Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?
Now, listen. For God's sake, try not to let yourself become obsessed with that idea. Go to your room and get back into bed.
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
I'll stay here also.
I'm going ashore to take a look around the island. There are some ruins up there...
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
You men are all so dreadful!
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
Yes, sir. Three times.
What other boat?
And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener.
Anything new develop?
Thank you.
Whose boat is that?
Your mother?
Zuria?
She costs a hundred thousand lire.
As a matter of fact, I've already had several phone calls on that article. One said they had seen the missing girl in an automobile somewhere in Rome. Another one said they saw her on the pier talking with some strange sailors... Could be she secretly left the island by boat...
No.
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
Should you see a doctor?
You have a lovely voice.
First thing that comes to your mind?
Uh huh.
Often?
No. I was sick.
Yes.
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
No questions.
Do you know a Marie?
What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
Do you believe she really saw them?
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
What did you do?
Agnes. What did your mother do to you?  If you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. Did... did she hit you?  Did she make you do something you didn't want to?  Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it?  Did it embarrass you?  Did it... did it hurt you?  What did she make you you do?
You can tell me.
That you're a mistake?
Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright?
Are you pretty?
Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you.
Did you know what was going to come out?
Why were you afraid?
To be a mother?
Will she be angry?
Who?  Who made you promise?  It's alright Agnes. It's alright.  Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
And then what happened?
Hm hmm.
Yes.
Do you remember what just happened?
The statue. She had shown it to me the day before.
Stay away from me...
For what he made me go through.
God!  It was God.  And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him.
She took the baby in her arms?
???
Eve, she strangled a baby!
Hello, Mama  ... brought you something.
It's your favourite...
The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens.
You can call me Sister.
I can beat that.
Is that normal?
Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.
Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
I believe Agnes is different.
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
Who?
I was appalled, just as you are now.
You hate us don't you?
It's my affair too.
What?
All right, what do you need.
Visitors to the convent.
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
The sheets...
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
That's all?  That's enough!  She was a beautiful little girl.
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Right.  What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
For Agnes.
Don't be ridiculous.
A miracle is an event without an explanation. If she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. Did you know about that? There's an answer Mother. That's how she got out.
Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
This is permission to take her apart.
Hasn't she had enough?
The baby?
You went to the room to help with the birth.
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
And the baby.
You tied the cord around its neck.
That's enough.
Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it.
Nine.
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
Yeah.
Oh, it's all right.
Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.
Can you fix him for me?
The police have the poor unfortunate lad in the Bridewell.
Sure.
I see you go to the night court.
He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.
Me? Why?
Look, I'm terribly sorry but I'm afraid there's been some sort of a misunderstanding.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
You see, he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher.
Sure. .
What's up?
Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
What are we waiting for?
Morning!  Who's that little old man?
Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.
Are you supposed to be here?
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
Gear?
Aye, I knew you were.
But that's not like a real person at all.
No, hang on, I've not gone daft. You see, when I was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery. When I'd done she said to me, "Go and give some to the other kids." So, I said I would but I thought to meself, "She must think I'm soft." Anyroad, I was eating away there but I wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end I wound up giving it all away ... but I didn't mind, mind, 'cos I'd made the stuff in the first place. Well ... that's why you need other people... an audience ... to taste your treacle toffee, like. Eh ... does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me?
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
Ah.
That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
So you <U>are</U> a man after all.
Do you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
What are you doing?
Well, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me.  Oh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still.
I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.
Would you two like a cup of tea?
That's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.
That'll keep you busy.
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
Anything to spare?
What are you doing there?
Y'what?
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
No.
Paul, John, George - get at it.
Now get on with it.
Hi Norm!
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
That's what you tell me.
It'll only get you into trouble.
He's betrayed the class.
That's right. It's always me, isn't it?
I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.
Where's my grandfather?
None for me, then?
Look after him.
Do I have to raise me voice?
Well, you stick to that story, son.
Course he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?
"The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr. Richard Starkey, that's you, in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet." Blimey!
Oh, he's gone to my club, has he?
What's the matter with you? You were bashing away like a madman.
I'll set John on you!
I'm going to buy a cattle ranch.
Engines off.
Dell, what's the last thing you can remember?
Do you remember the pyramid?
I got it.  Oh boy.
Can you get it a little closer?
Any rotation?
I'm sending.  Do you hear me?
I was scanning the horizon to see what I could pick up.  Look there, on that screen.
Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
What's wrong?
Breathe deeply.
Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about?
Sorry to interrupt, but I'm gonna charge up the engines for a minute, okay?
You like this shit?
But we can't kill it.  If we kill it, it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space.
Where's it coming from?
What happened?  Where's Sandy?
So does anybody have any suggestions?
Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
We can't expect to understand a life form like this.  We're out of our back yard.  Things are different here.
We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose.
Hey now, what is this?
Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped in there.  We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth.
Oh no!  We can't fight this thing! There's only six hours of air left -- we're dead men!
You can't say that; I think it's a good plan.
It will be.
It must have stopped moving.  I'm not getting anything.
But they don't know about the translation!  They could be in danger right now.
I've got 'em!  They're back on my screens!
This is horrible.
Well... I suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard.  Is that what you mean?
This should do it.
Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any response yet?
It's close, real close.
What'd he say?
If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.
We're going home.  We're in hyperspace.
I'm going to write a book about this expedition.  I'm going to call it "The Snark Log."
I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
First thing I'm going to do when we get back is eat some biological food.
Where are we?
This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we are not home.  Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all.
Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.
Yeah, okay. 
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.
Find anything we missed?
What would you say that was supposed to mean?
Here, Chaz.
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
You hear me, Martin?  Open the outer door.
I'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, Martin.  We never should have landed here.
I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
That's the part that always makes me feel like I'm gonna puke -- when we accelerate into light speed.
I think the best thing to do with Broussard is to just freeze him as he is.  It'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the Colonies.
These will be very useful.  At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands.  All right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship.  Whoever finds it first, catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock.  Clear?
Yes!
How did it get so <u>big</u>?
That next thing there -- six legs, tentacles -- that's the thing we saw in the food locker.
This is all the same creature.  We're seeing the different stages in its life-cycle.
Poor kitty; puss puss puss.
No... don't...
Me either.  I tell you, I used to be with a mining outfit on Callisto, and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it.
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.
Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?
Let's get back and call this in.
Nice howitzer you've got there.
Seal everything now!
How many of them are there?
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.
Where're they headed?
Picking up velocity.
Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.
How much air-time have I got?
C'mon, man.  One more sweep.
One of 'em must have escaped.
Hold it, hold it...
What happened?
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.
She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up.
Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em?
Everything on this module is locked and sealed.  We've lost 'B', 'C', and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally evacuate.
They knocked out the external feeds.
Communications to auto-shop go through an F.O. link off the main trunk. That's down with the other feeds.
There's still time to back-out.
Thanks.
I've got a lot of thinking to do.  'Sides, the room was getting too crowded for me.
Four.
Six month stint on Datus.
I've found Ackland!
Where'd you leave them?
I expected to find this little room overcrowded, with a theater full of people at your feet...
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
It needn't be.
Just like it.
Plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night...
We're?
Addison...
Addison, will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly - and then get out so I can take my nap!
What have you got to do with it?
I can't believe my ears...
Let's go sit by the piano.
It is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in New York, Hollywood and London are no different from the good people of Des Moines, Chillicothe and Liverpool. By and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children-
In my case it's necessary. Too many taxi drivers write plays.
Then stop being a star - start treating your guests as your supporting cast!
I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?
Eve, this is an old friend of Mr. deWitt's mother - Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington...  Addison, I've been wanting you to meet Eve for the longest time-
You mustn't worry about your little charge. She is in safe hands.
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four.
Naturally enough, your understudy.
Margo, as you know, i have lived in the Theater as a Trappist monk lives in his faith. I have no other world, no other life - and once in a great while I experience that moment of Revelation for which all true believers wait and pray. You were one. Jeanne Eagels another... Paula Wessely... Hayes - there are others, three or four. Eve Harrington will be among them...
It wasn't reading, it was a performance. Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire...
Eve was incredibly modest. She insisted that no credit was due her, that Lloyd felt as he did only because she read lines exactly as he had written them.
Bill!
Good luck, genius...
Oh well...  ... look through the wigs, maybe it got caught-
I told her. I sounded off.
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
Then you're crazy.
You in a hurry?
Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
Bill... Bill, it's your birthday.
Many happy returns of the day...
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
It's a good thought.
Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...
When I'm guest of honor?
I've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot...
Of course it's funny - this is all too laughable to be anything else. You know what I think about this - this age obsession of yours - and now this ridiculous attempt to whip yourself up into a jealous froth because I spent ten minutes with a stage-struck kid-
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano?  Where is Princess Fire-and-Music?
Often enough to keep the franchise.
Why what?
I think we'd like very much. Sure you won't mind?
Thanks for your help... good luck.
Bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here-
How do you do, my dear.
She, too, is a great admirer of yours.
You bought the new girdles a size smaller. I can feel it.
You don't like Eve, do you?
You all put together?
Please don't have me arrested, please! I didn't steal anything - you can search me!
I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
About how you live, what kind of clothes you wear - what kind of perfume and books - things like that. You know the Eve Harrington clubs - that they've got in most of the girls' high schools?
How long does it take?
That's the door.
So there you are. It seemed odd, suddenly, your not being there...
He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
I'm going to take you to Margo...
She's got to meet you-
Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?
Don't worry too much about that. Margo just doesn't miss performances. If she can walk, crawl or roll - she plays.
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
I was wondering whether you'd come at all..
Oh, but there is-
It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
Stick around. Please. Tell you what - we'll put Stanislavsky on his plane, you and I, then go somewhere and talk.
The curtains. I made them myself.
Well - what do you think of my elegant new suit?
That's my job.  See you at tea time...
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
Don't get up. And please stop acting as if I were the queen mother.
Good evening, Mr. deWitt.
Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all...
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
He always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical-
Karen.  I haven't been pleasant this weekend.
He's in love with you.
About Eve. I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her, too.
- 'at's my loyal little woman.
Coming?
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
What with taxes coming up - and since I'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well, I've been thinking...
You've got to admit it would be a novelty.
Eve did mention the play, you know. But just in passing - she's never ask to play a part like "Cora," she'd never have the nerve...
No, I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine.
Darling, I didn't promise Eve anything. Just said I thought she'd be fine for the part, but there were some practical difficulties...
- well? What happened?
Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is, what she's done?
I like that girl. That quality of quiet graciousness...
Who's left out there?
How's the new one coming?
I'm sure you underestimate yourself, Eve. You always do.  You were about to tell me about Eve...
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
Very discreet. A note right out in the open like that. Next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings - or tap a glass...
"Liebestraum."
You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way... and you need her, Max.
Promise.
This is for lawyers to talk about, this concerns a run-of-the-play contract, and this you can't rewrite or ad lib!
--it was fine the way it was--
Carl?
And McCord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the Democratic convention.  The Times has got to be full of it-- it can't be crazy Cubans.
--what do you think?--
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
You think they are confidential? I don't know anything about how this town works, I haven't lived here a year yet.
What's that?
--I'm trying--
---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP--
Who's first?
We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us.
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
How do you want to handle Sloan?
Goddamnit--
--for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
--Jesus--
--Sloan told the Grand Jury--he answered everything they asked him-- that means there's a record somewhere--
I finally got through to Sloan--it was all a misunderstanding that we had: he would have told the Grand Jury about Haldeman, he was ready to, only nobody on the Grand Jury asked him the goddamn question.
--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.
Morning or night?
Look, you've been jerking my chain all day. If there's some reason you can't talk to me--like the fact that you've already leaked everything to The New York Times--just say so.
I'll never get out of here in time.
The rest is Barker's bank records. It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand in Mexican cashier's checks--
Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy--
I called him from Washington. He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning.
Could you reach Mr. Dardis by car radio?
I'm Carl Bernstein.  My paper sent me out to see if I couldn't persuade you to go on the record.
I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
--he was going to go into law practice with Segretti.
--no--
--and we got a guy in Justice--
I thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story--  --you think I like being aced out?
--it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this--
I think.
I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
So tell me about the Times article.
No games, Irwin; give.
Something maybe big.
We were never told flat out "Don't talk." But the message was clear.
--well shit, we oughtta be tense-- we're about to accuse Mr. Haldeman who only happens to be the second most important man in America of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the White House--  --it would be nice if we were right--
Look--why would the Republicans do it? --my God, McGovern is self- destructing before our eyes--just like Muskie did, Humphrey, the bunch of 'em.  Why would the burglars have put the tape around the door instead of up and down unless they wanted to get caught? Why did they take a walkie- talkie and then turn it off, unless they wanted to get caught? Why would they use McCord--the only direct contact to the Republicans?
I was told by this guy at the White House that Hunt was investigating Teddy Kennedy.
We can't talk inside either?
Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.
That twenty-five thousand dollars is money I collected for Nixon in this year's campaign.
I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
Go on.
You'll have to find that out, won't you.
--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
Where?
When will you be, do you think?-- when are we going to know it all?
Never? Please don't tell me never.  Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.
--correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci--
Where's that cheery face we've come to know and love?
...go on, go on...
Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?
Who's Charles Colson?
--listen, we didn't make them do these things--once they did, it's our job to report it--
Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?
--no--
What do you think Mrs. Graham wants to see me for?
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
--and he says Chapin hired Segretti--
Mr. Sloan?
I'd like to talk to you, I really would, but my lawyers say I shouldn't until after the Watergate trial.
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that.
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
You work there, Miss Abbott.
What the hell was that?
You're a killer, Ozzy!
You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
Good morning gentleman.
Finch, don't you think it's about time you learned to take a dump at school?
Of course, Finch.  What?
What are we gonna hear?
You know, Jim...you could go back there...and...
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean <u>really</u> fast.
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
What?!
So you're going to Michigan?
You want onions?
Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
You're missing the game for us?!
Oz, it's okay, I know.
Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.
That's not why we're going out.
He likes it.
I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?
Are you kidding?  No.
Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.  Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So he did, and I did.
Give it to me!  Yes!
You think she was serious?
There's our man.
Alright...I'm shooting for a nine o'clock ETA.  Beer in hand by five after.
Gotta go.
Like a bet?
But, but -- what would I do?
That's stupid.
Hey, minuteman.
Alright, how do you guys stand?  Well, Finch, I know where you are, but you can't use that as an excuse.  Jim?
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
Yeah, bring it on!
Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.
Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.
What's up, fellas?
You are very good in the world history class, yes?
Yes.  No.  Yes.
Did you see this?  This is your more exotic dirty magazine.
No, not again.
Oh, Kev.
Let me know.
You're not doing the extra credit problems.
We've come a long way since Homecoming.
Like how?
And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.
You comfortable?
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it?
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
Say that again, Kevin?
Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
That's good, that's what I needed to hear.  Now you qualify.
You ever hear of something called The Bible?
And little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly, and asked me if I needed I ri-hide --
Okay, explain.
...Guess what?
That junior chick?
Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.
Our last game is this Saturday.
Geez, I feel bad for him. Maybe we should've told him abou -
Tell you what, we'll jump together.
Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
Thanks for the lovely evening, shithead!
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
Ha-ha!
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
You have to be a hero. All Americans think they are cowboys.
Fan-fucking-tastic?
What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour?  My treat?  Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you!
Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...
They're coming!
I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.
Holy mother of God...
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.
What does it say?
Okay. Be careful.
Oh God. Shit...
There's something down there! A bear or something! A god damn monster! Beau coup teeth! Huge, Grande, with yellow eyes, all this hair, it killed Serafine! My God...
Pull over! Now!
It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?
I always wanted to do that. I saw it in a movie.
It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known.
Psychic awareness. Right.
Uncle Terrence.
Because Gaston was after it.
Andy, I have to tell you about the dream I had - or that I'm still having - it feels like a systemic, physio- tropic reaction to some drug, maybe a triptamine or phenethylamine derivative. But it is hyper-real. I'd swear my legs had been cut off or... wait a second... I'm getting a strange meta-physical buzz. Shit. I'm, uh, dead, aren't I?
Where is it! Please!
He's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my English is better.  This way... So you're from New York eh? I love those Hill Street Blues...
Jesus...
Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
What do you mean, maniacs?
Why would he pick this one?
Not that I know.
Alright. Let me write a letter.
What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise...
Shit. I feel sick.
Yeah, well I don't know much about chemistry, but even if this stuff works, you better find it by midnight. Otherwise it's -
Andy, stop! I think he can help you - 
I need two tactical assault squads at Place Denfert immediately. You can tell the commissioner it's a code red.
Now!
Well?
Twelve thirty-six a.m. here. Twelve forty a.m. here. There's two of them. At least.
Saint Severin...
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
What were you showing her?
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
Where is your home, Anya?
You'll laugh.
Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
You never thought of the possibility?
By pulling my hair?!
I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
Don't let me go!
Who are you, child?
I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
Yesss... our power is much stronger when were near. We must get close to her.
Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
PARSE HOLDS THE KEY TO MY HEART FRENCH- BAT- CHICKS HANG OUT AT MONTMARTRE WE'LL EAT SOME IN-SECTS THEN GO BACK AND HAVE --
What was that?
Hurry up with those papers.
You're a princess...
See? The Princess is under there ...
How is our current financial status?
Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
So where will you go?
Please, if you'd just listen...
Empress, no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry...
May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
What's your name?
Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ!
Can I have your autograph?
Well, you take a meeting with him, I'll take a meeting with you if you'll take a meeting with Freddy.
It's an important issue.
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.
H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison... it's obsessing me!
It-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.
We've been through this.
Lyndon Johnson?
Bad mood? I'm standing with the cast of "The Godfather."
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.
I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what...  Am I your first big romance?
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
No, um... I was gonna take a cab.
I, uh... well, you're not from New York, right?
Right!  Where?
Uh, you're driving a-
All right.
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
Huh?
You're the worst driver I've ever seen in my life... that's including any place... the worst... Europe, United... any place... Asia.
You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?
Jesus, my-my grammy... n-never gave gifts, you know. She-she was too busy getting raped by Cossacks.
No, I got time.
Fifteen years?
Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic, by the college-girl mentality.
Neat?
Uh, I hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen seventy-five, you know that "neat" went out, I would say, at the turn of the century.  Who-who are-who are those photos on the wall?
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
I know.
Yeah.
No, I'm gonna quit!
Hey, listen, listen.
My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.
And blind people, crippled...
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
Oh, that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?
Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
I know you've only known me a short while.
I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
Whatta you mean? You're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you?
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?
Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
What are you doing?
Really?
Yeah. Yeah. And you know something? I think that I'm starting to get more of your references, too.
Yeah, I know, they'll hate me immediately.  Thank you.
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
Yeah.
She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
What?
I told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. You never know who's gonna crawl over.
Well, I was in be- It's three o'clock in the morning. You, uh, you got me outta bed, I ran over here, I couldn't get a taxi cab. You said it was an emergency, and I didn't ge- I ran up the stairs. Hell - I was a lot more attractive when the evening began. Look, uh, tell- Whatta you- Are you going with a right-wing rock-and- roll star? Is that possible?
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
Oh, look, look, there's that... that's that's my old house. That's where we used to live.
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
Check it out.
You were-you were sensational. I mean, I-you know, I-I told yuh that if yuh stuck to it, you would be great, and-and, you know, I-I-you- you were sensational.
yes, we had, uh...
...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.
Christ!
Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me.
You look very pretty.
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
What'd I do?
Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
Here you are. There's people out there.
Tsch, a few.
Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
I mean that as a compliment.
Probably on their first date, right?
What I wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure.
Yes.
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.
This is a great house, really. Everything. Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. Then you know who lived here?
Uh, you guys are still-uh, you're still New Yorkers.
Sixteen years ago.
Mean?
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
Max, my serve is gonna send yuh to the showers-
Do you realize how immoral this all is?
What's the matter?
I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
M'hm.
And I think they just came back from Masters and Johnson.
Hey, you guys are wearin' white. It must be in the stars.
Imagine my surprise when I got your call, Max.
You fired the cleaning woman?
Look at you, you-you're such a clown.
That was fun. I don't think California is bad at all. It's a drag coming home.
Now, don't let it be so long, now.
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
No, no, no, not at all.
Oh. What about?
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
There's a whole wing in this house.
Yeah.
Oh, and there's another thing about New York. See... you-you wanna see a movie, you have to stand in a long line.
Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.
Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new.  Who's that?
She's a constant surprise.
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
The movie.
You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
She already has.
Oh.
It sounds hysterical, but Otis just rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like to change into something of yours.  You know it could be disaster.  He's so allergic.  It's terrifying.
Would you leave us alone right now?
Just did.  Jealous?
Escape hatch.
So?
What is it?
Stupid tart.
I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry.
Cal, my wife Judy.
Time.  Hey!  Time.  Judy!  Time you guys. Hey!!
Are you my big hard hero?
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
He's okay, Clair.  You wanna give him a little room?
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
We'll be fine.
The Roses?  And of course they said yes.
Scout's honor.
No luck.
Happy anniversary, baby.
I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.
Accept a compliment.
Kiss the back of my knees.
I mean, you're really back.
What?
Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.
I'm looking forward to meeting you, too. And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. Eternally grateful, really.
Of course we do.  We have to sign our taxes.
Yes.
Still champions.
It's an unfair advantage.
Dolphins.  Great.
Don't be so sure.
Fuck you.
Otis!!!!
Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
You've been through it.  That's how you love people.  When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.
And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
Anyone else?
Happy anniversary.
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
I know.
We have a gift?
Oh.  Well.  Good.
It's a novel.
You lose this?
Sally did all this herself?
But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism...
Easy tiger.
I'm a little in the puke zone.
Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment.
Medallions.
I think there are sixteen there.
Ready to go?
Hi.  Monica and Ryan?
Hors d'oeuvres or something?
I'm sorry.
And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality.
I was impressed.
Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry.
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
Are you lovesick?
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
So how are you really doing, Panes?
How's the movie going?  Your movie.  You are making a movie, aren't you?
Um.  Happy for you.
I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center.
In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.
Isn't this a fabulous picture?
Well good.  Thank God.
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
I don't know what came over me, talking back like that.  I must be going crazy...
You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!
General -- we have to talk sometime!
He's...he's dead.  You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis.
He was a worker.  I danced with him at a <u>worker's bar</u> just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?
I -- <u>hate</u> -- you.
Water...water...
And only you can become a Queen?
So what makes you so special?
So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
Of course not --
Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General.
Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's got yer back.
Z!  Over here!
Hang in there, buddy!  You can make it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!
Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
What do we have on this "Insectopia"?
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
So tell me.  Where's Z?
Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there?
Yes, what else?
No snacking between meals!  Off you go!  Now -- what were we saying?
We declared war again?  Are you scared?
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?
I've been here twice as long as you have --
What did you do to your hair?
Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --
I hope everything goes all right.
They got a great little band at El Chico, in the Village -- it's practically around the corner from where you live.
Well, don't tell the fellows in the office about the appendix. They may get the wrong idea how you found out.  'Bye.
Marry Christmas.
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.
Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
You all right? What's the matter?
I thought maybe I could put in a word for you with Mr. Sheldrake -- get you a little promotion -- how would you like to be an elevator starter?
You're in no condition to go anywhere -- except back to bed.
Here. How about some breakfast?
You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
Your stomach?
Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
Oh. Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?
What do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents?
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
No doubt about it.
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
I know so. He's a taker.
Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
Worse than that -- she was the wife of my best friend -- and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless -- so I decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five automatic and drove up to Eden Park -- do you know Cincinnati?
Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?
Uh-huh. While I was sitting there, trying to make my mind up, a cop stuck his head in the car, because I was illegally parked -- so I started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off -- pow!
Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
I see you bought some napkins.
You know, I used to live like Robinson Crusoe -- shipwrecked among eight million people. Then one day I saw a footprint in the sand -- and there you were --  It's a wonderful thing -- dinner for two.
I mean, after that?
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
Are you sure? How's your knee?
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
I was sort of wondering what you looked like. Sit down.
Been hearing some very nice things about you -- here's a report from Mr. Dobisch -- loyal, cooperative, resourceful --
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?
Oh.
Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that cold --
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
I like the way you handled that. Well, how does it feel to be an executive?
You know how it is -- sooner or later they all give you a bad time.
Put me down for Thursday again.
Sir?
You're going to take her off my hands?
You left your wife?
Here's the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover. Thirty-seven percent of our female employees leave to get married, twenty-two percent quit because --
Very clever.
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
On account of me.
I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --
I'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise.
Look, you can't stay here. Just take your champagne and go.
Say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us?
Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
I sympathize with your problem -- and believe me, I'm very sorry --
You threatening me?
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
Quite an office -- name on the door -- rug on the floor -- the whole schmear.
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
You know, Baxter -- I'm doing some research at the Columbia Medical Center -- and I wonder if you could do us a favor?
There's a girl in my place -- she took some sleeping pills -- you better come quick -- I can't wake her up.
What are you going to do, Doc?
Any of that coffee left?
How do you spell her last name?
She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --
It's just that she's got a family -- and there's the people in the office -- look, Doc, can't you forget you're a doctor -- let's just say you're here as a neighbor --
Yeah, wasn't I?
Say, Baxter -- we're having a little party and we ran out of ice -- so I was wondering --
What's this -- you packing?
Where are you moving to?
Can you use a bottle of champagne?
No, thanks -- I don't feel like it. Look, Doc -- in case I don't see you again -- how much do I owe you for taking care of that girl?
What about him?
Who is Mickey?
A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Say, this is Snugsville.
Hi. How's the branch manager from Kansas City?
Yes, I know.
Still afraid somebody may see us together?
How do you think I felt -- riding home on that seven-fourteen train?
You're not being funny.
If you'll just listen to me for a minute --
Some setup you got here.  A real, honest-to-goodness love nest.
Where do you live?
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.
You bet it won't. I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay --  That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go.
You came in on that boat, didn't you?
Where are you headed?
Look -- you know the girls -- Thta's Terri -- she was playmate of --
We could use some fuel -- just a half drum -- just enough to get us out a here.
No -- absolutely not --
I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --
How about a drink ?
That's quite an array of ribbons...
Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 -- Com-Sec -- Intelligence -- Nha Trang.
It's really too much -- I mean I've collected every picture of her since she was Miss December.
So what happened ?
Holy shit.
What do you see?
Whatdoya think it thinks.
What are we doing here?
When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
Smoke !
Rocks, sand -- those two men who deserted.
Who knows? Right.
Anybody see some smoke ?
I never heard about that.
What does that mean ?
How did they know?
Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir.
I don't know. He was a lame, that's all.
A habit of men of war, sir -- you understand.
Two of my men deserted last night. It happens from time to time. I assume my daughter told you of our conditions.
Good swell.
They far enough?
The wind --
Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !
This is Baker Delta Four -- Captain hit bad -- need dust-off. Receiving heavy automatic weapons fire from huts about thirty yards to our left.
Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th Recon Group -- I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence 11 Corp -- I believe you understand the nature of my mission.
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?
That village you're pointing at is kinda hairy.
I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
Fucking savages.
Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt?
You've gone crazy.
No -- I don't want to sleep. I want to think. Water. Give me water.
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
How did we get here?
Go away -- hide yourself.
And you admired him?
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
He'll kill us.
Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
No -- no, Captain.
You hear it again?
You think he'd of shot us?
You think?
What?
Captain Willard?
I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --
But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.'
Sounds like he's gone crazy.
Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?
What's a big question?
Well who the hell verifies that ?
That's 27, sir.
What makes you so sure my boys won't be waiting for us?
95   CONTINUED:
165  CONTINUED:  
165  CONTINUED:  
You'll catch a chill by that dumb waiter shaft.  Sit on the cot.  Keep this pointed at him if I get preoccupied.
184  CONTINUED:
Watch it with Meyerling.  Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.
27   CONTINUED:
Where'd you say Eric is?
He's coming around fine.
Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!
Be careful, okay?
Surviving is what I know --
Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head.  You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?
Sure love to know where you fit in up here.
There's a snowmobile. Inside a day we could be on the Yukon.  I got money there.  Remember that five thousand?  Make it ten.  Be smart.  Take it and walk away.
Stay awake!  You want to go hypothermic?
What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
Stay still.
What do you know about people? You live like an animal!  A savage goddamn throwback like you belongs out here, as far away from the rest of us as possible.
They think you're in Fairbanks. If not, they still won't find you before the plane comes tomorrow.
Relax.  One more day without drink won't kill you.  Right, Sam?
All this for laying traps on private land?
Goddammit, I don't need this aggravation.  I'll shoot you, Ben.  Bank on it.
If Corbett's men find out --
You don't care enough about Sam to --
Neff, you know better than this...
This miserable wilderness is a state of the union.  Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box.  That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late.  Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads.  With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World.
Bet you're right.  But I didn't come by to wangle a meal --
LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
Look, we pull Ben's ass out of the fire, I'll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars.
You hear me?  Ben?
Okay, let's backtrack, try to pick up his trail.  You know the kid out on the pipeline that Wilder's buddies with?
Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
It lets a crazy man into our lives.
I don't know... It's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody. Today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and I felt myself giving them a dirty look -- I had no idea everything was...
Hi...  Did you know there are doctors who come to your house?
Do you love me?
Have they done blood tests on him?
It's amazing these things weren't done.
Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?
The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection...  Is this bothering you?
An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
Sorry.
You know he's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in.
Oh, please...
And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?
This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...
What about your mother?
Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.
So. Anything else?
Okay.
No... no thank you notes.
Lovely.
Nice of you... thank you.
Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, "what?" I thought I said, "what?"... What?
No, sir...
I can't. I work.
My son.
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?
Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
Well, ah... that's a personal question.
I don't.
How you doing?
The two might go together.
What do you want, Melvin?
No!!!
Good night.
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
One night with me!
What the heck are those for?
You changed the room around...
Simon, you've got to get dressed.
It's not my dog and this Simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off.
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
Hey -- you called me... I...
Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.
Good evening.
How you doing, great one?
No. Please, don't force him.
Is he dead yet?
Absolutely.
Sure thing.
That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like...
Rot in hell, Melvin.
I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back...  But the tiredness -- boy...  Not just sleepy.
Not it at all, really.
... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
What are you talking about? You got real problems.
Good-bye.  Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.
Exactly what is your previous experience?
So you're practically finished, huh?
No shit.
Probably.
Boy, that's fucking genius.  You're a fucking genius.  Then you're just sitting there, bullshitting with me. Man, no way I coulda done that!
Hey.  What I don't get was why didn't you take the shot inside the restaurant?  I mean you had me, a free shot.  That's what I would have done.
Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus fucking Christ!
What are you doing?
Listen to me, Bain.  Two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where I was going to pick up the transferred money from MicroCell. You don't know how they got the information.  It bothered you, but you didn't care.  How do I know this?  Because ten years ago, I was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now.
Yeah you are and you hate it.  You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't.  That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.
Did you see how I did that?  Magic wasn't it?
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
Send the file.  I'll have the estimate tonight.
What?
Who?
Deadline?
I have been sitting on a contract from Cleveland for six days because of you.
I give a fuck?  I'm done!  I quit! Do you fucking hear me!  I'm fucking gone!
Is this how it went, Nick?
Nikita?
What does that mean?
So this is something between you and him?
He wants to kill you?
Forget it!
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
Yeah.
Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
Because you are a women.
My first take?
Why?
Do you think about the game?
But you've never figured out a way to win.
I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have to deal with these.
This is the bank.  This is the hotel.  In the morning I will enter the bank.
Ten years ago.
Was that it?
Ten years later, here you are again.
He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
Attraction is a complication?
It happened to you before?
Was she the only one?
Were you attracted to me right away?
When did it start?
Maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
Wait until he is on the stairs.
I'm taking off my mike.
You're very good at this aren't you?
That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected.
Do you ever think about starting over?
Thank you.
Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that.  'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'  I never would though.  Not really.
Some.
How would you like the funds?
Of course, senor.
That's true Doug, writers are supposed to write.
Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
Because it's in English?
Oh yeah, what's that?
Okay, it's in here somewhere. Let's keep it quiet.
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much.
I'm making history Chris, nothings going to stop me. There could be a knighthood for us in this, once President Havel hears.
Well, don't get carried away.
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
I don't know but that used to be a window and I think that was a door.
It must be on the other side of this.
I'd love to get in there.
Well, it's definitely there - We've just got to get to it.
Moved on to plumbing huh?
Destroy the evidence huh.
Nope.
Close!
Let's split.
You get the wine and I'll go see if I can rustle up some plastic cups.
Thanks. Come on Chris, give me a hand.
A fine specimen for conversion.
Do you want me to see what's on them?
I made a deal with Josh.
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
Date of birth, November the fourth nineteen-sixty-two.
Your home address is 18 Thornton Avenue, Coventry.
I could pencil you in if you like?
I don't want to get in trouble.
It's not fair, you hardly talked to me tonight.
I hope you're going to invite me in?
I could have my choice of many boyfriends and go to movies and discos but I waste my time waiting for you and then going to stupid pubs.
It was a mistake, I never wanted to hurt you, but it had to end sooner or later and now, well now I love someone else.
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
Sure, they are students.
They'll do it.
Yes, it's looks good.....We will use this for the soundtrack and we will have two guys up there with the spotlights. The others will just be house lights.
Tomorrow, we will bring some lights and also hang some fabric. I think it will be finished in the morning.
Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!
And take Jiri with you?
Will they free me?
Will this thing take long?
You mean it's started?
How do I know what's being said?
No act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a rose-tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale-skin body.
What's the Bugler?
Is it dry?
I'd better get going, do you need a hand to get into bed?
Better than you.
Why don't we both forget about him?
Head the flyers up with Asylum and then put Debut of....Psychosis, Theatre experimental. That'll cover us if it flops. On the bottom put seek Asylum where the stars shine on Betlemska.
Good try Mr. Greenwell but a little late. We have analyzed the contents of that drum, the remains of the disks are there, just as you said.
You are playing a very dangerous game, I suggest you make it easy on yourself and tell me where they are.
I'm not sure it's possible.
That's okay I like the metro, it's only a couple of stops from here.
Hey Doug, where you been?
And a fifty foot extension lead?
Yeah, so I hear. Don't you think you should go get changed?
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
So, what have you got to say for yourself? Was he good in bed?
Will you come home and forget all about him?
Have you lost all control of this city?
And there has been enquiries from the American Embassy maybe they are involved?
That's one girl who can't take a hint.
Your father dropped off an extra check.
Out with Belinda?
You look nice. I should have dressed.
To see your father?
You do. You're handsome and charming.
Everything's being done but it's not enough. I have to find something -- more.
Where is he? He's supposed to be here.
You.
Because, growing up, books were my world.
You don't know me.
Yeah.
Looking for intelligent life?
Yeah.  I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
You're really into God, right?
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
Or anywhere where people might see us.
People can see.
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
So you're talking to me?
She great or what?
Your turn.
It's places like this that make me certain there's a God.
From here he proved to me the earth isn't flat.  On rainy days, we'd be above the clouds.
What'd you tell your father?
'What is a friend? A single soul dwelling in two bodies.' Aristotle.
The Carter boy. Tell me about him.
By accident --
I'm sorry your mother isn't here to help you become a woman.
Did you give him a gift?
Boys like him have -- expectations.
I'd like to take Jamie to dinner on New Year's Eve.
Landon. You're not the quiet type.
So talk to us about something.
It's her decision and she's decided not to tell people -- at least for now.
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.
Now I can do what I want.
Shall I give you a few ideas?
Finally, I'd like you to join the drama club. Rehearsals are Tuesday and Thursday evenings.
For Jefferson High. For books.
Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.
I've been calling you for five minutes! Didn't you hear me?
Huh?
You remember me...?
What time does school start around here?
Are you all right, Marty? You seem a little...nervous.
Now, George! Dinner's ready now!
Why what?
Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.
March 11th.
What, am I radioactive or something?
Okay, Martin. You have a good evening now.
The power of a million hydrogen bombs!  ...and we get twenty four measly volts. It's not fair! I've been working on this power converter since 1949, and you'd think in all that time, I could find the right chemicals that would efficiently convert radiation into electric energy! But no! Thirty three years of dedication and research, and all I've got to show for it is a bootleg video operation!
Exactly two minutes difference...  and it's still ticking!
All I know is you're throwing away an awful lot of money.
Professor, you time machine works! It works! It sent me back in time! I'm from 1982!
You've convinced me that you must be who you say you are. No living human has ever seen this machine.  But why? Why even in my twilight years would I remotely consider sending someone back in time?
You answered the door!
An atomic bomb.
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
That's all taken care of.
Look, maybe I'd better talk to Dick. Is he around?
Can you imagine your parents in bed together?
Suzy!
Hi. where's Cato?
Gone?... Where?
Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
You promise to stay down there for an hour?
Where'd you get them antlers?
Yeah, I guess.
What'd they look like?
That your spider in there? In that bottle?
You ever had to open it up like that before?
Kit... Kit, I've got a question for you.
Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
I mean it.
Sure is pretty.
What do you think you're doing? Go on, get out of here.
No, you're not either.
Jack.
Can I be honest?
Nothing.
How do you say "Quit my Job" in Spanish?
You want to go for a ride?
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
My stomach's growling.
Don't call me stupid.
Look at all this junk.
Whatcha looking in there for? We can't afford any of that.
What'd you put him in there for?
No.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
Boy. I had a feeling today was going to be the day... Helicopter.
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
What's that?
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
Yes.
You're my friend, aren't you?
Morning... Say, you got any gas?
Hi.
There's another one we owe 'em.
See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield...
Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...
What?
Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
What crate?
We will, old fried, we will.
It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
Dead.  Damnit!
I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.
They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10!
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.
Got a casualty list?
Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?
He offered you money?
Go away.  Let me rot?
You.  Like the papers all say.
I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me.
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
You keep an eye on it.
Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
Buckaroo, come in...over.  How does this damn thing work?  Can anybody figure this lighter out?
What's happening with my call to SAC?
I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm sure he'll want to reschedule your appointment.
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him!
If you could, I'd 
Yes, I'm afraid I have.
I'll try to slip out. If he quiets down, passes out... I'm afraid he thinks  well, he said you were a buffoon, Barton. He becomes irrational
No, I  I didn't mean to sound 
Yeah, he's funny that way.
Well that's what he said.
I'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific, and from there I'll... improvise.
...Look, they love you, kid  everybody does. You see Caven's review in the Herald?
...What is it Barton? Are you okay?
Go ahead, son.
Well, I'm... glad to hear that 
...That's fine.
Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man  from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and  and  and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and  well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
...And look, I'm sorry as hell about the interruption. Too much revelry late at night, you forget there are other people in the world.
Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic thing.  Goes away for a while, but it always comes back. Gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus. Don't worry, it's not contagious.
My folks live in Brooklyn, with my uncle.
...What's the expression  me myself and I.
...It was taken by one of my policy holders. They're more than just customers to me, Barton.  They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time 
Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had one of those days?
...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if my problems amounted to a hill of beans. How goes the life of the mind?
You're leaving?
...Your room does that too?
Hold on 
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?
Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
...Yes, thank you.
...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?
I  Mr. Lipnik 
Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider 
Fink.
Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. My name is Chet.
...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
Got a couple questions to ask ya.
Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers.
Tell us where the heads are, maybe they'll go easy on you.
Why's it so goddamn hot out here?
...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. Talking about the Wallace Beery picture.
...Maybe we should do a treatment.
Okay.  I went after him.  I lost my temper.
All night?
I want you in Dr. Gardner's office at nine o'clock.  You're out of control, Curran.
I can get my butt kicked for this. You're not supposed to be in here.
How are you, Nick?
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick.
No?
Yes.
You okay?
We were in some of the same classes.
It's the least I could do... considering I got you into this mess with those reports.
What is this interest you've got in her?
I thought you hardly know her.
She told you, didn't she?
Why did you change your name?
I'm De...
Did you go home with him?
Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.
Do you have a cigarette?
I thought you were out of cigarettes.
What's your new book about?
Did I miss something?
Even though you were fucking him.
Sure.
You tell me.
I didn't.
I like you.
Why take the risk?
Maybe she saw something she didn't see before.
What did you think?
How about Roxy?  Is she a fuck to the century, too?
Are you kidding?  You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
No.
You won't believe me.
I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.
What did he say?
You still think I kill people, don't you?
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
No thanks.
Why not?
Why?
There is no smoking in this building, Ms. Tramell.
Would you tell us the nature of your relationship with Mr. Boz?
Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?
I don't really feel like talking anymore.
The answer is no.  I didn't kill him.
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
Was she ever a suspect?
She knows where I live and breathe. She's coming after me.
I don't think it's funny.
Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?
Catherine says you don't like her.
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
Maybe the maid did it.
You're already gettin' psychological input, son.
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
What was the motive?
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
I.A.'s going to talk to you more about Nilsen.  They're handling the investigation, we're not. Stay in touch with Dr. Gardner, it'll help on the evaluation.
First you've got her buying your file.  Now you've got her killing Nilsen.  Forget her, willya?  Go someplace.  Sit in the sun.  Get away from this goddamn fog.  Get her out of your system.
You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way --
You knew her, didn't you?
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell.
Why do you think he's dead?
Anderson.  Jack W. Donald M.  I'm sorry.  No Lisa.
Yes I did.
No Lisa Anderson, detective.
My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me?
Is this finished yet?
This is painted on a backdrop from the Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. The Chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else..
Saddle River, New York!
New York.
You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks.
Jean Michel, this is Mary Boone. She's got the great new gallery.
Cool.
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
That was my favorite part!
I'd love to see some more of your work... Where's your studio?
When?
I hear your show was sold out already. There's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works.
Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.
What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
I use a lot of colors  not only black.
Not what?
Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called  hmmm...   yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
Why, that's from Time Magazine.
Or rather, do you think you're being exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black artist from the ghetto?
Yeah.
I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday.  Here  I made this for you.
What're you doing? You're doing something.
Have you been camping? You could use a scrub.
You do! You definitely do.
I don't go there. Too many party girls.
... What's the matter?
You look fucking beautiful, beautiful.
Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were 
You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.
Hi.
No, I'd like the scarf.
I don't eat junk food.
You see? You have someone to live for.
That one's for you.
I need this?
YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.
I suppose you feel better now, sir.
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
Where's the fire?
What're you really after?
Didn't I say that?
I'm listed.
The news these days ... weird. People looking to superheroes for their peace of mind, and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves, or their spouses at least.
You almost sound enthusiastic.
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
"Vicki."  Ice-skater, or stewardess?
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
Ingenious costume.  Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody?
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
Thanks.  Jeez.  Not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me, I tell 'em take a number.
... eight, seven...
Don't look, Oswald.  It's a surprise.
A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...
Working late?  I'm touched.
Is there something wrong, sir?
Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
Advanced botany.  DNA splicing. Recombinant animal plant patterns. Pheromone extractions.
Al's main squeeze.  Is she here?  I'm about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue, right?
Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge.  They kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
Pow!  What!  Kazow!
... A giant drilling truck burrowing under the city ...
Watch the first step.
You don't have two million.  Three million - -
Pull back.  You can't make the jump.
I'm totally over her.  Positively.
Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
Forget the stars.  Look here, at the Earth, our mother, our womb.  She deserves our loyalty and protection. And yet you spoil her lands, poison her oceans, blacken her skies. You're killing her.
Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
Tell me, billionaire, would you warm faster to my pleas if I looked more like Ms. January here?
Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
He needs extreme cold to survive. His cryo-suit uses diamond enhanced lasers to keep him at zero degrees.
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
I got the diamond.  Quell problemo, Bruce?
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss?
Impressive
My reserves are exhausted.  I must have the gems that power my suit.
In my weakened state I am no match for the bat and the bird.
Make yourself right at home.
That is far too merciful.  Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
You're too late.  Say bye-bye birdie.
The dreams again, sir?
...Would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment?
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
...The night Batman was born.  What was I doing in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can't remember.
Gee, I'm not sure.  Alfred? How many rooms? Total?
She's the first woman in a long time that's... No. She's the first woman ever. And she loves Batman. Not Bruce Wayne. If I let go of Batman I'll lose her.
...Afraid.
Master, Bruce?
What do maniacs always want?
What now sir?
_Two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _Second_ Bank of Gotham on the _22nd_ How could Harvey? _Two_-Face resist?
Why's that?
Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
Death.  Death. Without taste, sound and all around us.  Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap.
Mr...?
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?
Call my secretary, she'll set something up.  Factory looks great, folks.  Keep up the good work.
We'll talk some other -
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
I think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats?
But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
But...
Touchy, touchy.
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.
Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away. It'll make it worse.
Chase?
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world? My RES Box will give Joe Q Public a realm where he is king.  Not that someone like you would need it. Someone so intelligent. Witty. Charming. But for the lonely, the...
Hell. Might even bring old Stickley here a few extra bucks. Huh, Fred?
Yo. Charlie. Gimmie an order of brain deep-fry. Extra well done. Hold the neurons.  Patient exhibits symptoms of psycho neural overload. Notation: obviously higher settings can be dangerous to the subject.  Riddle me this, Fred. What is everything to someone and nothing to everyone else? Your mind of course. And now mine pumps with the power of yours.  New from Brain-bok. Da pump. Think faster. Reason higher. Out-cog-nate every homey on the court of life. Da pump. Yeah.  Ho! Mark. I sense an odd penchant for the anagramatic. The acrostic. The crypto-graphic. What doth this bode? Answer me Marcutio, you little runt.  Fred, I must confess you were a wonderful appetizer. Simply divine. But now I yearn for a meal of substance. The main course. A wide and varied palette. Ah, to taste the mind of a hero. A nobleman. A poet.  A chick in a short skirt wouldn't be so bad either.
That floor has got to be very hard. Is that better?
How'd you find us?
Yet so bright and chipper and conservative!  It's so you.  And yet so _you_!  Very few people are both a summer _and_ a winter. But you pull it off nicely.
Holy shit.
Oh my God. Jim Morrison was right.
Why do we need you? You only come between us. We can be the smartest person in Gotham City. We want the empire for ourselves. Time's up, laughing boy.
How high up would you say that is?
Mr. Wayne is out for the day.
Excuse me, sir.  Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave - -very unexpectedly.  He asked me to convey his regrets.
It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control.
GET IN THE CAR!!
Thank you, Vicki.
I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost.  Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?
Is this what you wanted?
Great.  Give me a grant.
"This is Miss Vale." -- That felt redundant.
No.
God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.
To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.
All street mimes should be executed.
Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing.
Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.
Got it!
I don't know why I'm doing this. I half wish you'd stay a cripple.
Okay, a break-in.  Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage."
I understand.
Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
I don't like taking orders from Grissom. And I especially don't like taking orders from Grissom's goon.
That's it?
All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --
... Thank you.
... Why the mask?
You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.
Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.
Peanuts?
Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
Nice snap, huh?  Pulitzer Prize, 1963.
Yep.  He watched the whole thing happen - - Recognize the beat cop?  Jim Gordon
He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...
It isn't working any more, David.
Liar.
I know you are.  Very serious ... most of the time these days.
Oh yes.
'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?
He's just parking the Governor's car.
Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the English art world.  Has a couple of doctorates no less.
We'll be able to start this afternoon.  I'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery.  Now, that'll impress the Governor.
This is Elmer, our longest serving...
Okay, that'll do.  The Governor's here in half an hour.  We have to be totally ready then.  No excuses.  Period!
Maybe two cars.
As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  Nobody gets past Elmer here.  Isn't that right?
... in the distant future.
Doctor Jacobson?
We need you urgently in C Theatre.
Come on Sting!
What's gone?
What a dork. Huh huh.
We're gonna get paid to score.
Uh, huh huh, this is Las Vegas?
Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding a sign?
Uh... Hey baby. Are we like, doing it?
So, uh, huh huh. Are we gonna score now?
Ow, let go, Butt-Head!
Damn, huh huh.
So, like, where is she?
Check it out Butt-Head, TV!
Hey, where'd those chicks go?
Hey Butt-Head, isn't there supposed to be like, water in cactuses?
Whoa, my life is cool!
Heh heh. Fire. Heh heh Aaaaeeehhhhg!!!
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
Hey Butt-Head, do you think we're ever gonna score?
Um... ass... head...
Hello there. Are you two heading for Las Vegas?
Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!
We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
Cavity search...?
We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
Do her? Huh huh.
This is Travis and Bob... What's your last name, dear?
Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?
Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.
Maybe I am three-eighty-five if you carry a second lien!  I can arrange the most creative financing in the six states of New England.
Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
What?
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
Maybe this is heaven.
She can't see you, right?  In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.
Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell.  I hate these people.
Barbara, honey!  Don't go out there.  You don't know --
What about this Beetle guy?
Are you crazy?  She can't hear you.
Yet another triumph for Adam and Barbara in the afterlife.
We'd like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here.  Barbara and I worked very hard on this house.
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
Honey, I think that was a mistake.
But <u>we</u> let him out.
Lydia, believe me... we know... all the hard stuff is the same over here.  You're going to be who you are... whether you're alive or dead ... and over here -- it's... It's flat... there's no food, no colors ... you can't smell the flowers.  If we knew then what we know now we'd have been more careful...
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
We've been given a gift here, honey.  A real live little girl. She likes us a lot.  She needs us. Maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to <u>things</u>.  The house, antiques, your model.  Look at us. We didn't have room for anyone.
What?
Did you get the paint?
Nine months?  What difference does that make?
This is <u>my</u> town.
Hell is other people.  You obviously don't read much. Besides things seem pretty quiet here.  You should thank God you didn't die in Italy.  The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been studying the manual?
Just get some people out of our house.
I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have <u>killed</u> him.
You lilly-livered bleeding hearts!
No, you don't!  He does not work well with others.
What about Betelgeuse?
I don't wear that stuff to <u>bed</u>. Besides, there's <u>nothing</u> wrong with it.  I'm getting out of here.
So, <u>never</u> let Beetle Juice out. Never.  Besides...  We're thinking about letting everyone stay... You and your father and mother can stay too.
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
I don't know what that signal means.
Beetle!
Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit battle? Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
Can you help <u>me</u>?
W... What is it?
Your qu...?  But you're...
Yes, of course you are.  Well, Otho had an intuition.  Call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house.  And it certainly is.  Charles, you're lucky the Yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I'm going to have to do to this place. We are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>!
What do you think, honey?
I was just trying to open the door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought over a skeleton key.
What?
Answer your mother.
I'll bring the wine... and the business plan.  And Lydia you'll bring the ghosts.
They're... not here anymore.
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
I don't care from guilt.  I just want to <u>see</u> them.
Are they suffering?
I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --
Is there much more of this torture?
Are they still here, Otho?
What's happening to them?
Is this the key to the attic?
Otho, that's terrible.
Their wedding clothes.
You were wrong, it did hurt.
I'll send Wilson up to take you for X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort.
I swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, I've got my hands full...  ... Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably...  ... Any pain here?
... Were you going somewhere?
... Oh? You've heard?
I would like to walk today.
Yes. I love Eve very much.
A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act?
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.
Oh. I have a message for him.
... Won't you let us do something for you? Your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital.
I hope you're comfortable.
These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.
May I ask your name?
Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
Oh, I like that very much.
I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...
... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be...  I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?
I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.
Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!
Good, sir. And so, it seems, did the President - but we would like to have some facts; such as, uh... What exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the First American Financial Corporation?
Can you see well?
Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?
Yes, Eve. That would be good.
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.
I feel very good in here.
Failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells... Not a damn thing they can do about it. Oh, they can make me comfortable, prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions... And what makes my blood boil, what little I have left, that is, Mr. Gardiner - is that it's generally a young person's disease... Here I am, getting on in years and about to die of a young person's disease...
Well, that's good news, my boy.
No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man.
He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he?
She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
Of course, who can nowadays? I have trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers...
Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
... Then you really are a gardener?
What about money?
Some pictures...?
How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely you must have paid taxes?
Can you walk? It's not broken, is it?
It's starting to swell, is it painful?
I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you?
How long do we stay in here?
Good morning, Louise.
Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know what I was expectin' from you... I'm sorry for yellin' like I did... No sir, I just don't know what I was expectin' ...  ... I 'spose I'd better gather up some breakfast for you...
... Well, ain't you the gentleman this mornin'...  ... gotta go now, Chance...
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?
... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook?
1952...?
Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.
You look much taller on television, Mr. President.
... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?
... Sid, be reasonable - I've been everywhere, there's no place left to check!
Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
... Maybe you should talk to somebody, darling.
... This is another world, Tom - I never would have believed it...
... What do you make of all this?
... Business, bullshit! Going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar...
What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
Sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments.
You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
Well, Ben... I...
You're right, Mr. President I don't like feeling sorry for myself.
Say, aren't you that actor guy?
Thank you.
I never played a jewel thief.
When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
Which one is Elijah again?
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
Now?
I have to go back, Craig. Being inside did something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I was.
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
You've always hated the animals.
And he was with her.
Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.
It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her actual tits for that matter. If only, I've been thinking to myself, if only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels, rather than just see what he sees... And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms, his legs, his pelvis, and make them do my bidding.
I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question.
It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?
I know.
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Money, Miss Warts?
Mr. Juarez?
Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.
Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. Ladies, I begin. I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
Dr. Lester. . .
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
So, tell me about yourself. If you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough, dog-boy.
Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see...
There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
I've fallen in love.
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this.
Have a seat. I wracking my brain over this Malkovich thing.
How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
What kind of circumstances?
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
Forget it.
Oh, be still my heart.
I'm getting divorced.
But now we've lost access to Craig.
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?
How do we do that?
What's the play?
Never heard of it.
That was incredible. You're brilliant!
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!"  The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!"  Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!"  Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio.
Bad dream, darling?
Yeah what?!
I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
There ain't.
You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
You still know.
They'll be all right. I'm surprised they lasted here this long.
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
CAN THEY GET IN HERE?
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
You on your way home?
She gone like they say?
Well, if you want my opinion...
Well, good luck with the job.
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
Be here. In case.
They good whitefolks?
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
Mama let me help you.
She likes this dress...
Can't locate him.
The church!
Till she showed herself.
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
But you didn't come here talking 'bout Paul. You came asking about a new girl.
Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our price in the future? How are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are they gonna pay for us, if we free?
Leave off..
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
Tell me something, Stamp. Tell me this one thing. How much is a nigger supposed to take?
What, baby?
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
Sure Allan, I'll be there.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.
Hey, man, I'm not--
There's no ransom if you don't have a fucking hostage.  That's what ransom is.  Those are the fucking rules.
I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!
Excuse me?
What's this?
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
Almost five!
What tied the room together, Dude?
What--
He peed on the Dude's rug--
What's a pederast, Walter?
They posted the next round of the tournament--
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
Kill that poor woman.
And then they're gonna stamp on it?!
Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration!
I've had a--
--had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man--
And this is the study.  You can see the various commendations, honorary degrees, et cetera.
That's the key to the city of Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was given two years ago in recognition of his various civic, uh.
--without  the means  for higher education, so Mr. Lebowski  has committed  to sending  all of them to college.
1972 Pontiac LeBaron.
...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But it's nice when they offer.
Howdy do, Dude.
Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I gotta get back.
No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--
Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, man!
Hello, gentlemen.  You are the bereaved?
Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
And please don't call her my mother.
And then. . . let's see, I uh--music business briefly.
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance.  He has no money of his own.  I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.
Increases?
No, but--
Donny!  Please!
Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it is no dream.
Hey man--
Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.
Walter, they're calling the cops, put the piece away.
Okay then.  We play Quintana and O'Brien next week.  They'll be pushovers.
Anyway.  How much they offer you?
The what?
Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a fucking game, Walter--
FUCK.
What the fuck?
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
Thanks Walter.
Uh.
You're going to enter a world of pain, son.  We know that this is your homework.  We know you stole a car--
Huh?
Walter, come off it.  You're not even fucking Jewish, you're--
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
It's all over, man!  We call your fucking bluff!
I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
'Scuse me?
C'mon man, who're you gonna believe? Those guys are--we dropped off the damn money--
Oh, shit.
Smokey Huh?
Yeah, but--
What?
Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.
What was that?
You're hurt.
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
How do you feel?
What do you think?
I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.
I did some checking on that Carter Stevens character.  That familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the NIH? Turns out he used to work for them, but he doesn't anymore.
Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!
Put it back in park, Blade.
You want me to hunt them for you.
And why is that?
Nomak?
Hey, hey!  The fuck you doing?!
Hey, you think I don't know what's at stake here?  We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass!  And for what?
This whole deal's giving me a serious case of the butt-willies.
I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum --
Stupidity.
Get in. Youre leaving.
You shouldn't be here.
And you honestly expect me to believe all this?
I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
But, he could've --
Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
What am I injecting you with?
Any progress?
You don't look so good.
How long have we been driving?
Is it bad?
It won't work on you.
Get out of here --
I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?
I wish you could see the world as I do. Deacon opened my eyes. There's no turning back from that.
The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them.  Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated.
I see. And what would you have us do with this "half-breed"?
LaMagra --
I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this.
Basically you'd have to re-write the victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin.
--or incredibly fucking naive.
Try, please, Anna--
What, are you alright?
You killed Domini, didn't you, witch??
Please! Please...? I haven't done anything.
Domini?
What're you doing there?
--stop it! Stop talking about it! I'm gonna freak!
Something was wrong.
No!
Just trying to set the mood for the mission--get the "feeling."
Where they found the backpacks and all the film a year later.
So says her website.
Jesus.
--chalked just hours ago by ancient adolescents. It's called vandalism.
--brother of Rustin Parr's maternal grandfather, somewhere after 1858--
Your parents didn't have a <u>bigger</u> one?
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
What?
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
--now c'mon!
We'll stay overnight, get a hotel--
Then I'm going--
You mind me asking: why the fuck?
It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!
I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--
You're a complete fucking idiot, aren't you?
From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?
You're not only an idiot, you're a goddamn <u>child</u>.
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
No fucking.
We should be so lucky.
--yeah, a hand or something--
Me, too.
What about night?
English.
Where's Domini?
Cotter?
Remember....what Mary Brown said-- she could see the witch's hands on my face, her mouth sucking on mine.
This is her equally on-the-rag boy- friend, Nick Leavitt--
<u>What</u>?
There's four other angles, man, we haven't even--
Just let it go, I've got you!
What is all this shit?
Look at those marks--just like in the movie.
What's that?
For a blur?
Jesus.
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
The good old days: toasting marsh- mallows over a burning witch.
Jesus, you don't think I know that? You don't think I've tried? She won't fucking <u>go</u>-- she won't leave this place.
You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--
What?
What the fuck's going on here?
Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy.
....Ma'am?
There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.
...I mean, I don't know where he is, but he ain't dead.
...Drive me to a motel?
...I can find a place tomorrow, then I'll be outta your hair.
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
When you don't they're usually nice.
...You called me this morning.
What happened?--Was Meurice there?
...That's what's important.
...Who?
...You leaving?
...So?
If he does come in I'm not here... What were you drinking, Debra?
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
Sure don't.
...Figured I'd better leave before I used it on him. I don't know how you can stand him.
Well now you do.
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
Yeah.
...Just doin' my job.
...That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love--
...What?
...What did you do with the bodies?
Something I got to ask you, Marty. I've been very very careful. Have you been very very careful?
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.
...it's too damn risky.
Pour that back.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
Thanks Meurice.
...Why?
Jeffrey. you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
See you Tuesday, Frank.
Anything you can tell me?
Is that why you say it's horrible?
Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Hello, baby.
. MOMMY!.
Look at these. What are these?
He's comin' back?. What for?
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Shit. You better tell me something.
THEN WHAT?
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Oh shit.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
Yes.
No. I should go.
Come in.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
I want you to hurt me.
I asked first.
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
Yes.
Who, Dorothy?
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
Yeah, how did you know?
What do you know about the ear?. anything?
Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
I don't want to cause any trouble.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
I'm sorry, I didn't.
You want to tell me about it?
You saw a lot in one night.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret.
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
It's okay.
Really?
Probably not. no. Why?
... Sandy?.
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
Would you like a piece of cake?
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. real good.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?
I've been holding this shit for him for three weeks.  You tell Diego I don't appreciate it.  You tell him I want my money by Friday.  Can you do that?
On the plane.
No honey, I'm alright.
Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie.  Why don't we start small?
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
Blanca, por favor.
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
Are you sure this guy is cool?
We're gonna call it California sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.
Should we buy it?
What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not a chance.  So, what's the verdict?
Two years.  George, I can't wait that long.
Tuna, this is crap.
Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?
Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
What can I do for you guys?
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
What the fuck is that?
What can I do for you guys?
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
The way we figure it, Barbara flies to Boston twice a week.  Two bags per flight.  Twenty-five pounds in each bag.
I don't know...
Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited me.
Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.
If you don't mind me asking, what is the reason you are in this place?
No, my brother.
What type of planes do you have?
This is only part of the business, George.  A very small part.  Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you.  I must go to Colombia.
Thirty-six hours.  I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.
Touche.
Three million.  I counted it twice.
I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me.
I did not.
No, I never.  I would not do that, George.  Never.
Mexico.
Barbara.
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
Layaway shmayaway.
What do I think?  I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know.
Yeah, maybe.
I'm sorry, George.
I know.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
What are you going to do?
May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face...
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
You're not going to trial?
Tell Mom, you know...
And that FBI agent, Trout?  When he had to get on his knees to put my boots on? You said...
I meant every word of it.
George.
Source?  What about Derek?
Why are you smiling?
I don't want, alright?  It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew it, now leave me alone.
California, huh?
Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?
I swear.  On my life.
I didn't mean to...
But I have a visitor.
But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.  My daughter.
Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?
Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.
Good to see you, Jorge.  You are a man of your word.
Well, I'll tell you.  I was walking down the beach, minding my business, when who did I see but this fucking guy.  I didn't know you guys were living in California.
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
Okay.  So we need a source.  Where do we start?
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand.  It's all there.  Wow.  A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.
Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said lately not only of the successes obtained by the paratroopers, but also of the methods that they have employed ... Can you tell us something about this?
Second district ... Explain better ...
What "group"?
How much are they paying you?
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
It's better to split up, to increase our chances. We must change hiding places, and change them continually ... In the meantime, we must make new contacts, replace our arrested brothers, reorganize our sections--
Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...
It's good nobody is following us ...
It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.
No ...
To show them to the UN, right?
Good evening ... Can we pass?
Please, we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah.
Good, thank you, Corbiere... . See you tomorrow.
And so the tapeworm no longer has a head. Are you satisfied, Mathieu? In Algiers everything should be over.
That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I credited you with an advantage greater than I should have.
Who is speaking?
Are you ready, colonel?
Yeah -- I hear they had 'em a real dog and pony show going on up there - -  I'll tell you, sometimes white people are a real puzzle to me.  I mean, did this old guy really think he was gonna be able to keep up with a sweet little number like that?
I would have missed it -- but the phone rang and I let it play while I talked.  It looks like blank tape -- but it isn't.  It's been erased without any input signal coming in.
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.
Marsh wasn't alone.  We found traces of sperm on the sheets.  The toxicology report says there were high levels of cocaine in his blood.
That's what my report will read.
What are you saying, Henry?  That his girlfriend fucked him to death?
So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
Is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand?
Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A.  Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover of Miss Lawson's.
No questions.
That's it.  My client doesn't have to take this crap from you.
Lookin' to make the papers, John?
Why would she want that?
Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness.
Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.
Can I go?
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart condition?
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?
Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death?
Just one last question.  What does the sign on your office door say?
Mr. Roston, what was your relationship with Miss Lawson?
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
What kind of condition are you referring to?
What happened after that?
Yes.
Where did you meet Miss Lawson?
Why?
What kind of information?
Don't you see what she's doing?  She needs you to kill me.  She's planned it that way from the start.  That's why she phoned me tonight.
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps?
October twenty-seventh.
I heard him say it.
No.
Where did you meet him?
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
Did he make your life miserable?
What about Miss Lawson?
Who told you that?
That bastard!
--And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?
Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought?
I'm gonna go to jail.  I know they're gonna make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone.
Then why did you go see Mr. Koehler in the first place?
Hi, Joe.
I'm not asking for names or specifics.  I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me.  That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
Something like that.
I think we're getting a little off the subject here.
How?
Nothing.
Yes -- she did.
You and me -- making love.
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
Something wrong?
I'm sure you'll be able to handle him.
Hello?
But Your Honor--
This is not relaxing.
How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults?
Frank -- stop it!  Stop it!
Albert's got the stomach flu.
No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.
Not even if they're a dork?
Let me go!  Godammit, Frank let go!
Yes.
Did Marsh use it?
Well, that's a long time.
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
I don't mind waiting.
Eeeww!
I thought everything WAS arranged.
Yeah.
What?!
"-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. It's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives --
Grateful!?
What are you doing?
He's getting her drunk. That's what happened. Jesus, maybe he forced himself. That's why she couldn't tell us.
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
Bar across the street.
Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
Are you supposed to be in Iowa?
Roseman Bridge?
Are you from Washington originally?
You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
So, how long you've been living here?
Men sill give women flowers, don't they? I mean, as a sign of appreciation? I'm not that out of date, am I?
Lemon?
My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer.
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
You ought to write these stories down.
I'm sorry. That was...
Smells like dirt.
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
But it's not the same.
Listen, I'm sorry I --
Would you like a beer for your bath?
Are you comfortable?  Do you... want to move to the bedroom?
I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening.
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
What were you like when you were younger?
You're somewhere else, where?
What are you doing?
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
No. Don't do this.
What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
Where you going?
Franny?
Oh my God...!
Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.
Outta my way, boy.  Cinnabar?  I'm coming!
Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.
What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
'S up?
Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.
Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.
Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.  Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
...Bones ol' Bones so mean and bad, whupped his mamma, shot his dad.
You want us to move in here?
Yeah, we can.  Least till after this weekend.  He ain't going nowhere.  We'll deal with it then.
Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.  That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure.
Clean your mouth, or I will.  Those boys had no business messing down there.  Go places you're not meant to be -- that's what you get.
I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.
But.
'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun.  Get back on the curb!  Now!
One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...
What it will be.
You know I can't.
It's alright, baby.
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
no really, let us help.  We're new in the neighborhood, gonna be neighbors.
Are they on the radio?
He probably thinks he's saving you from something.  I'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
I can't.  Not yet.
Why couldn't you just tell him to let us in?
Here, find my hand.  The stairs are right near here.  I saw them.  Let's just walk up there.
Let me see it.
What are we doing down here?
No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
What the hell do you want?
Don't shit a shitter.  Our building. What did you call it?  His 'tomb'?  We had an agreement.  You were supposed to sit on it.  Not sell it --
You're right.  One of my associates sold the building last month.
And damp, too.  Let's not forget damp.
You haven't?
Why not?  He eats everything else.
"Like a heartbeat/Like a love beat." Listen to the Di Franco twins there. Just the plumbing or something, fool.
Not really to live, just to play.
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
Well, the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each.
Caesar?  What is this?
Gimme the gun.
Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too much.  I have to get out of here.
Caesar, what happened?
Where the hell's the laundry detergent?
You mean they weren't up here?
It's impossible!
Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?
I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in Lake Michigan ...  I need plastic bags ...  tape and rope ...
Where is the money?
Violet!
Don't try to tell me what to do.
Shut up, Violet.
I saved you.
Fuck, this happened before.  It's this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm sorry.
You're helping Rajeev?
How many'd you do?
What?  How about a drink?
I'm going to ask you where the money is.  Every time you don't give me an answer, I'm going to cut off one finger.
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
I started thinking maybe it's about the money so I call you, but all I get is the busy signal.  I figure the phone is off the hook, that's why I come rushing over here.
Actually, yeah, she was nervous about Gino coming, wanted everything to look right.  You know women, Mick.
Hey, Caesar, where's the key?
Un-fucking-believable.  I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.
So this is temporary for you?
Truck.
Caesar is your husband?
I should be going.  You can drop the cup off anytime.
Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?
How long have you been with him?
What's wrong?
Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's a lot smarter than you.
We make our own choices and we pay our own prices.  I think we're more alike than you want to admit.
Yes.
Gino Marzzone.
That's his brother.
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment.  It's a big deal, isn't it?  That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before?
Does Johnnie hit on you?
What time did you say they would be there?
And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands.  -- and shatter against the hardwood floor.
I'm just asking, what if?
It's me.
okay, all right.
Oh, thank God.
I was so afraid you ...
Hey.
Hey, Caesar!  You take care of this girl, or I find out!
Oh, God.
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.
Yes.
They're putting together an agency oversight committee.  They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger.  What am I going to do about that?
We're exploring <u>every</u> possibility.  We are in pursuit.  How much more do you want me to tell you?
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
I'm going to Paris.
I won't ask again.
Paris.  I live in Paris...
I don't think so.
Jason Bourne is dead.
Who do you think sent me?
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
Well...  I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.
Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we didn't hear back from you, we did some re-analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we'd really like a chance to do a bit better.  I'm assuming you're still in the market.  It's the same vessel?
I need a ride out of here.
Please.  I don't want to scare you.
I've got a situation here and --
So what's in Paris?
I said ten thousand.
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
Shit --  Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out?  Okay?  Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.
No.  No, I mean, I really don't know who I am.  I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I'm serious.
Look, go ahead...put the radio on...
And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that?
-- you could put it together --
We're about an hour away.
Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
This is like a real apartment.  This is really yours?
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
-- we'll tell them what happened --
You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--
What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
xxxxxx
And that's it?
<u>Miss Kreutz</u>, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States --
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
What?
What the fuck is he doing?
What?
What if it doesn't come back?
...ergency procedures.
... And then some.
I think you've got your T41 crystal inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin- threaded-solenoid-control. It's either that or a new washer.
Sign the form so we can get to it.
Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
Yes, it's all a bit confusing but, it seems she was killed resisting arrest.
Hello, Jack!
OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting.  My tailor,... well worth the investment.
You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
Enough though, eh?
Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
What's she done?
Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
Why? Hell, not for any reason ...
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
Say it was a mistake.
Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
Jack, she's innocent!
Yes we have, Jack!
Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
Stamped?
Are you alright?
You know, smoking's bad for you.
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
OK. What's in the parcel?
I mean, it doesn't suit you.
Security.
Turn!
Please, Jill ... I love you.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Oh, good!
It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again.
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
I know that.
Lime, I need to use your computer
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
You remember Samuel, my son.
Numero une, crevettes  la mayonaaise. 
I hope you like it. It's very exclusive.
What were we saying?
Sam ... you haven't had dessert.
Mother? Is that you?
It's a refund ... I'm afraid there was a mistake.
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
Numero huit, braised veal in wine sauce. 
Put the phone down and your hands up.
Er, don't you want to search me?
Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office?
Yes?
But we can get one.
What the - ? How did you - ?
What?
For God's sake, what's happened?
Can you fix it?
Are you expecting anyone?
What am I going to to do with this guy?  Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.
No English. She has terrible pain in her belly.
No underwear?
She asked me to pick her up.
What about Kanita?
That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.
Is he going to be alright?
He's very very sick.
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
He's dead, huh?
I think this place stinks.
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
Sleeping.
Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like.
You married?
If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.
Don't give me that look.
Where you going?
He one of them?
Oh Jesus, put her on the monitor. Where's the pediatric code cart?  Odette give me that tube. All right, flatline--let's do CPR. step back, Frank. How many months?
No.
Would you like to come in?
It's not worth it, Tom. He's surrendering.
These are hard times, Tom.
Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it?
Whatja doing?
Mr. Oh.
This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term "menace to society" was made up for him.
Turn it off.
Don't push it, Larry.
Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.
Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.
Tell me, you ever think of doing anything else?
He's crazy.
You're in the stomach! Let me try.
Keep it to yourself.
You're feeling good, aren't you?
I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.
No.  That's not going to tell us anything.  Let's get this prompter going.
You were smokin' toward the end there.
Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
You packing up tonight?
Hold it down, okay?
Hi.
I'm just bringing him over to give Jane a look at him --
Okay.
It's nice to see you.
You're saying the fact that you're gay had something directly to do with your promotions?
Hi.  Turn on your TV... <u>Good Morning America</u>, the <u>Morning News</u> and <u>Today</u> are all about to talk to Arnold Schwarzenegger and I think he's live on at least two of them.
Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now.  But he's not ever gonna change.  He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie.  He feels no different.  He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.
I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.
I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...
Because this is important -- so don't just be polite.  I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?...
How'd it go?
Do others feel that you did well?
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
Aaach...Jane...  Let's take the part that has nothing to do with me.  Let's let me be your most trusted friend, the one that gets to say awful things to you.  You know?
How?
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
You are now required to sit here with me.  Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
I don't know if we have any younger man more respected in our operation than you.
Do it then.
It's what he did.  I'm proud of him.
How long has it been since you've been home.
Okay.  I just wanted you to know.
Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait of a <u>Homecoming</u>  The return of a fighting man has always been one of the more moving ceremonies of war... Tearful women, proud men, excited children.  But J.D. Singer was right -- his homecoming was no big deal.
I was a little nervous there for a minute.
Just when do you start, telling people?
Jane?
Well, darling, if it gets any better than that, I'm going to have to bring you up here to New York.
Yeah, I know, I went back and forth on it.
What are you dressed up for?  Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week.
They canned me.  Well, my brother will feel great -- now he's not the only screw-up.
Because...
...and the White House is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do.
...am starting to get jealous. I read in the newspapers about the Italian strike and riots in Milan.  I hope you weren't...
You know, Tom, I feel a little proud when people comment on your looks.  Maybe you should feel that way.
I got my report card.  Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
I had no idea she was this good.
Hi.
Thank you.  They hated me.  I don't hate them.
If we could just eat first.
I was doing sports at the station. The newspaper ran this untrue story that I was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail.  So they made me anchor.
I'm sorry if I was in the way.  It was totally impressive.  Great piece.
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn.  I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...
I've got another story.
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
Yes.
So what did you think?
I'm not sure.  It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
I knew what you meant.
You're saying stay away from him.
Would you like to do me?
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?
It's kind of dark -
Not even a little bit?
Alright we're clear.
What the hell's going on?
I've never seen anything like this, maybe Segal, but nothing with such... dichotomy...  It's very good, Walter -
Great!  What is it?
What's up, Walter?
Oh yeah?
Well...what did you want to talk to me about?
- even though Leonard's always asking you to go out with him and I - just -
Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
Here you go, enjoy.
It will take years to make that many statues.  But your work would be featured.
Look at that, man.  Big deal.
I wonder what his deal is.
Now what kind of statue was that?
That's alright, we got a pressing engagement!
Alright, I'll tell you what.  I'll put it in the corner of the alcove. If it sells, we'll split it fifty- fifty.  How's that?
Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone's really crazy about Dead Cat.
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't...
Hello, Walter.
Did you see my cat?
I'm not looking to pinch you!  I don't care about you, or the girl.  But you want to save your ass, you better start telling me what I want to hear.  Now!
Wait a minute - I told you I didn't do nothing wrong!
I thought you believed that life is a homeless traveler riding on the RTD of -
Wheat germ omelette, guava nectar and garbanzo sprinkled with smoked yeast.  Join us?
After that we go no more!
Why on Earth should you be so depressed?  Have you heard some of the things they've been saying? You can make fifty thousand on these pieces alone!
A hot light bulb is burning inside of you.  I want to be warmed by it.
Well, I'll go home with you.
T-tell him that?
Don't tell me I didn't hear a racket!  I'm an older woman and I don't need to be upset and disturbed in this manner!
Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
I don't think this is gold.
Man has a complex.
Buffy!  Looking tasty.
Rich bitches.  They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped.
When you get your car together, man, let's bail.
I... feel.... pretty.
Your parents are always going away for the weekend.  You're so lucky.
Hi, Buffy.
Do you know what time it is?
Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe it's that outfit...
Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
Come on, what was it?
Hey there.
Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight?
Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat.
So that's your tutor, huh?  What is he, like, your boyfriend now?
You're even weaker than the others.
Will you guys shut up, please?
Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby?
Well, stay here tonight.
Buffy?  What's wrong?
I crashed your party.
Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
I'm going out the front.
Are you okay?
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
It is a pretty crucial subject.
Like what?
What are we doing?
Excuse much!  Not rude or anything.
You were supposed to be here at three.
Why?
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
How do you know all this?
Where's the other one?
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
It was necessary.
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
He was slow.  Very simple.  They won't all be that easy.
Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject.
You are such a wet.
Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
How can you keep doing this?
We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
I want to die.
Football is my life.
None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
Hi, guys.
The mark of the Coven.
But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers.  Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called.
Bessel!  What are you doing here?
You think so?
Write that down.
Oh, yes!  Yes!
She was even crazier after that.  I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her.
The homelesses?
Oh, yeah!
And the January Semi-formal --
What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
God...I think I'm gonna be sick--
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter?  We better not fuck.
That's my leg.
I'd like you to meet my father.
I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...
Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here--
Neither will I.
--Millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse.  It'll just get everybody in trouble.
You should be at the game.
I don't dance.
I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of Thomas Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated crap.  I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter, I believe in the "sweet spot", voting every election, soft core pornography, chocolate chip cookies, opening your presents on Christmas morning rather than Christmas eve, and I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last for 7 days.
Don't tell anybody.
Crash...I want you.
What happened?
Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.
Oh dear....easy honey...
Let's have a quick word of prayer, right here, to thank the Lord for all this--
What's that?
Will that work for me?
I got him on the knee!
Did you call me a cocksucker?
You missed the tag!
Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
What do I got?
You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're pissing it away.
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
You're through with one night stands?!  What do you want?
You're weird, man--I want a ice skater real bad.
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
I was playing naked.
Annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while I'm on the mound, thus keeping my brain slightly off center, which is where it should be for artists and pitchers.  She also said I should throw whatever pitches you call for.
Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
Hey, I'm cruisin', man--what're you doing out here?!
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
"...Good Lord willing, things'll work out."
Anybody says anything bad about Millie, I'll break his neck.
Why am I a fuck?
Nuke...tell me something.  Did you hit me with your right or your left?
Crash Davis?
We fight, she gets the clown-- how's that happen?
Dad--if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me.
Ohyeah.  I shoulda throwed a slider.  Damn, Crash, how're ya?
Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once.  Sold Lady Kenmores--it's nasty, nasty work.
What'you want, kid?
Ain't here.
Well, I'd rather not say.
I mean, the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History.
So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.
Hey, I need a room. Need a room.
That's right.
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.
He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court. He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this?  He's out of his fuckin' mind.
No, you're not calm.
Hey!
Look, look. You can't stop her for speeding? I mean, look what the hell she's doing.
But one thing I could never understand, was that she could have everything under control, except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond.
Yeah.
She's my wife.  Look at me. You did know that, didn't you? You knew that she's my wife? Huh? Hey, look at me.
You understand? Put her on the fuckin' phone.
Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife.
Amy! Amy, open the door!
Mommy.
When did this happen, honey?
You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?
But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.
You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
I'll take Columbia for twenty.
Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.
When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.'
I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.
What?
If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again.
All right, Ace?
You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already.
Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years, he always made money with them.
...very difficult to get in.
Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you?  All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time.
I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
You lost your control.
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?
Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible!
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you -
She was afraid to call you.
I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it?
I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause it turns out Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.
Well, sir, I was just...
...trying to offer you the respect that your...
It's always been our policy -
Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants.
This woman's an institution.
You're with me now.
Right?
You sure?
So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day?
Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...
What are you talkin' a- ?
You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you?  Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?
Huh?
You can't make me stop caring...
If not for me, at least for Amy.
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
So, what'd ya do with it?
I bought him a watch too.
Yeah.
Get off of me! Stop it!
You're lower than a dog!
Here. Here. Is this enough money?! Huh?  Will it last you two fuckin' days? Take it, greedy bitch.  Take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want.
I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you!
She had the same.
Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
...she did what she did and I did what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could've done.
I mean, it could get us both killed.
Hi, Sam.
Fuck you.
Now you need approval from him to go home?
Don't you threaten me!
Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
Okay, I'll -
Well...
Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
You might regret this, Mr Rothstein.
...worst possible time for me.
We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over.
No.
I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.]
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
Can I go in?
No, you can, you can.  You've been so nice to me.
What do you want? It - It's pitch- black out here. It's tin foil.
It looked like a fuckin' gun!
Fuck you! Fuck you!
You called my friend a faggot? You tell him to go fuck himself?
Is that what you did?
Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.
You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.
Forget about it, Nick. Don't let it bother you.
Carmine left?
Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are you doin' here?
Artie!
No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.
I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens.
He gives a fuck what I do?
And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse.
Thanks.
And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay.
I mean, listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it... I mean, it's none of my business, but I ... I think that's what you gotta do. You gotta take it somewhere -
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
You did. I like that. I like that. That's what I like about you. You did the right thing.
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What did I tell you? Supposing he goes back home and makes a fuckin' beef?  I gotta know exactly what you said. Tell me what you said to him.
Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.
Get the fuck out of here.
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!
Great.
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean?
Don't give me any of your shit!  Okay, this has always been a dream, but we're going.
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
Just knock it off! Would you two knock it off? Get in the car.
No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -
There's more!
Hey, how you doin'? 
How many of these you gonna eat, huh?
Yeah.
Come here, come here.
And this is Stacy.
Yeah, but they're complaining.
You must have drunk too much.
Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
I fucked up, Frankie. I fucked up good this time. Should have never started with this fuckin' broad.
Charlie M?
How you doin'?
You're a little confused?
I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it.
My fuckin' head.
Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue...
Since when do you talk like that?
I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...
I know it, I know it.
You'll get a heart attack like that.
...done right, you gotta do it yourself.
Hey, Hot Stuff. You're still on the clock...
Have we reached the epi-center?
You say that like an amnesia victim.
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
You designed Gotham Plaza?  The big silver guys pulling on those big silver things...
I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?
I despise these kind of winds. Sorry, I guess I'm a little on edge. Seems this Catwoman has everyone, men and women, on edge. Don't you feel Catwoman says something about the duality of all men and women...
Selina, did you make it home, all right?  I tried calling, but your mother said that there was "no extension in the Hut." Whatever that means..
No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause--
Quite a pair we make. Thank you, Jeff.
Women, huh?
You're right, I wasn't looking to fall in love with a casino worker. I'd given up trying to find anyone. But there was a fire in your eyes that cut right through the air conditioning and through the coldness of my heart.
We're waiting.
I can. That's not an admission of guilt,  It's just..I knew you had it in you...
I've been looking for you.
I thought cats were supposed to have nine lives, not thirty one!  What do you think you're doing?
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
Don't you realize there's nothing you can do, anyway!  Nine minutes and it's all over!  The Fun Palace is a tomb. No one can get out. And choke on this furball: all doors and windows are blocked, locked, and electrified!  Even the glass around the bomb is rigged.
The "skylight?" Fool!  It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
The shopkeeper on 13th street won't drop the lawsuit--He still claims one of the lasers we fired at the Jenkins gang burned down his store..
What's the catch?
Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."
I don't know, Boss, you saw what the big guy did to the last kitty we gave him.
You like them, don't you, Boss.
Oh no, not a computer disc. A computer disc?  Oh man, come on, what do I look like?  I'm not a crime- fighter, I'm not a detective, what, I'm supposed to find some "clues" on this disc. I can't...
"Save the City?" I don't want to save the city, I want to move!  Listen, I'm sure the computer disc is pretty fascinating and I can't thank you enough for the little weird gold thingie, but..
You Housewives have no idea what we go through!
Yeah, she's okay.
Sorry, I get carried away. Once I become interested in someone, I can't stop trying to figure them out...Amnesia victims are challenging..
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
Hey, architect--she's joking. Right, Selina?  Selina?
Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me.
Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.
But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
You're the One. I thought I told you to stay hidden behind the couch, CAT! You've torn the unit apart.  You've driven a great leader insane...
Was someone in an accident?
What if they do question the authenticity?
I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
I know where it is.  Give me that phone back.
Let's have your license, mister.
How do we get back to the freeway?
It took you long enough to get my ass out.
You never miss a trick.
You switched license plates?
We have never worked a gig together but I am a firm believer in preparation.  So let's go over this again step by step.
We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
Okay, okay, Lenore, calm down. Either let me call the school or better yet, the F.B.I.
I thought you said you could handle him.
Don't fuck around.  Pop a cap in him.
We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
Do I know you?
Lady, try making some sense.
Who smashed the phone?
You're the one who's not to be believed.
Don't lay this on me!
Where'd they take you to?
I'm with two friends now.
He's right.  You'll get my whole family killed.
Where's the fucking recharger cord?  Must be in her car, dammit.
I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
What bank?
You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?
What's going on?
You can't give up.
What did you do?
Can you walk?
It's locked.
For Christ sakes don't point it at me.  We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece.  I'm waiting for the girl.  Her mother wants to talk to her.
Whose money is this?
And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.
Tell them I'm keeping what's left. I earned it.  I probably killed some poor bastard for it.
Now you're starting to sound like a victim again.
Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
Did you hear that?
Think you could do a picture of me?
Yeah, I was waiting for that suggestion.
I want you all in one vehicle. Your van.  If I see anybody else cruising around I'll keep going. No second chances.  You can kill them and I'll keep what I've got.
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
It's in the process.
What's he doing?  Answer me!
Okay Nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about.  I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.
What does it take to kill you?
I can see the benefit in that.
Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds.  I may need to pry that information out of her.  What do you stand to gain?
In the hills above Sunset.  Just below the Getty.
Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them.
The 405 is coming up.
You sure know how to take a lot of punishment.
You could always make it up to her.
See that, Col?
Fuck off, Dave.
Don't be like that --
Hey, Stirling fucking Moss --
Look, I'm sorry.
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
Doesn't the water get to your nails?
No.
And what's it like?
Tell her I'm very happy with it.
You old-fashioned?
You all right?
What was that all about?
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
You got a special friend, Jimmy?
Someone out there.
Sorry. How'd he drive with his neck in a brace?
He lived here with you?
What does that mean?
Why?
The thing is, can you go the distance?
Come on, Dil --
Sorry, darling.
My, oh my, Jimmy, how gallant.
Kind of liked you as a girl.
Don't ask me in.
No. Can't pretend that much.
Should have stayed a girl.
Shouldn't be, Dil
She own you, Jimmy?
Why?
And you wouldn't leave me?
Are you supposed to take that many?
You killed my Jody?
Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.
Why?
More endearments.
Tell me you love me.
Then say it.
Say it again.
Not if you go.
Sorry, love. Now, the white ones are magnesium supplement --
I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the leap year. What am I supposed to call you then, Jimmy?
Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil?
Hey -- what's he like?
Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
Of course. I forgot.
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
Back in a minute, Jody
You sure about that?
I thought it was Dave.
He's at home.
Thank God for that.
Hope not.
Thank you, handsome.
How did you know it was her?
Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.
What makes you think that?
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
Can't. Once I signed up.
So when you come to shoot me, Paddy, remember, you're getting rid of a shit- hot bowler.
Can't.
Now put it back in.
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
Having two pints in the Rock.
Do you?
Is it bad?
I didn't.
I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...
Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.
Give me the shooter, Jude --
Oh, you should see your face.
I know why you're not taken -- no one can catch up with you.
I think we were wrong about Tex having the money.
But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it.
Yes, you told me.
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
I think it only said where -- but I can't --
Of course there is!
Now what?
But Charles' appointment was last week, not --
Then say it.
I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?
Ours.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --
Yes -- ?
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
It's the man who came to the funeral yesterday -- I'm sure of it -- a tall man in a corduroy suit and string tie.
That's a face you don't forget -- he was there too --
Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --
Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
You'd lie about anything.
That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
Good morning, Mr. Dyle.
Your --
You can't.
There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
But I'm not through complaining yet.
Or Tex?
What's so illogical about that?
Hm?
Got you.
I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?
The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.
After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss.
What for? If it's not here, why bother him?
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you?
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
Oh, la! If I find the treasure, will I win a prize?
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
Voil what?
I don't know -- how would I know?
Sorry. Which view would you like?
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
Yes, but we're divorced.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Hallo, Peter.
What's going on?
I'm still having trouble with English.
Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?
What was all that?
We're here.
On the street where you live.
Do you know what's wrong with you?
What?
I'm so hungry I could faint.  I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet.
What'd he say?
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
Miz Lampert, ma'am...
Charlie had no call to handling it this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
You know what I want, Miz Lampert...
Stop that!
Can you give me one good reason why I should?
He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but --
I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
Yeah?
Yeah. Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.
What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy.
I think it's funny.
I get all your CDs.
Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?
You said that two weeks ago.
You found her?
Did you warn her?
What are you doing?
Of what?
No.
We just found another body.
Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown. Kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school. It's turning into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert.
Pay no attention to me.
You fucked me up!
Please get out of my way or I'll have to hurt you.
You aren't going to the party?
We're all manipulated. From the moment we're born. The event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before I was even born.
_ Your father raped someone?
Yes.
You're the killed.
No!
Not that many.
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
This place is empty.
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
I heard you got attacked.
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
You know I want to go with you.
Mom?
She's nobody you should be concerned with.
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
Mr. Sisler was one of them.
On what side of the family?
What?
Dylan's been telling people that Annette gave him a blow job.
You got a great mom. I'm lucky to get a zucchini stick.
Now don't be nervous.
There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.
You can't bring it.
Hey! That was a 3k machine.
On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
Damn.

...if we don't get out of this tunnel!
A little early for a delivery.
That's my business.
...moron.
Uh, huh?
Aw!  Oh, Jesus.
No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
Then you drive me to McGrud-...
Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
...doing?!
It happens to this piece of shit...
...-ed.

...town. 
...-er.
No, no, no.
No way.  We're goin' through McGrud-...
You stole this truck! That's...
We can't push old Pete in this heat.  He can't take it.
Shut up.

 Nice job back there.
Don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
You wanna hit me?
...I believe in live and...
I did not steal the truck.
I think...
...do we?
Go, go, go, go, go.  Oh, shit.
Come on, old Pete.
...easy, easy, easy.
Ho, ho...
No.  Shit.
All right, let's go.
Okay.  All right.  Okay. 
...you're dealin' with!
...here!
Come on!



Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck.  Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...
It won't even start half the time.
You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
How wonderful for you.
And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
...shit.
Not completely, anyway.
 ...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...
 

Hey, just shut up.
Oh.

Arlo!

You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...
Oh, fuck!
Whoo!
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.
Forty-nine point four.
Mason.

Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.
They'll meet you at the top.
What'd you come back for?!
You did help a little.
Us.  Owes us.
 Yeah.
Thank you very much.
I feel faint.
I was undercover as a tennis player.
Hey.


Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?
Vaughn.
It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
...Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now, where's my goddamn truck?
Why don't you get that tub of shit Sam to...
...here.   Mason... 
You got a prob-...
Well, why don't they talk to the sage of Jerome here?!
Your country and a lot of innocent people in it...
Exactly.

They were all wearing hardware.
What the hell is all this about a detonation today?  We're scheduled...
Now listen to me.
 All right.  One more shot, provided...  we're off the island tonight.
No, go--
Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in?  Well...
"Went away."  I like that.
All right.  After they put you away...
And let me guess.  You failed.
Brynner.
Get 'em on line, then stall.  Long can't have gotten far.
...comes up that road.
Well.  It appears someone's been lying to us.
Carl, establish contact with that deputy we met earlier.  He'll be more useful now.
Hit him again.
This was supposed to be a...
Vaughn, get the M-seventy-nine ready.
What about these two?
Mind if you tell me what's goin' on?
Hemmings!  Sam, I thought I told you to close up shop and be ready to move up the island by night-...
...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
Doc Long.  Yeah, I know him.  Weirdo guy. He comes in from...
...should be right outside.
I want you to look at one another...


Dead, last time I...

...-son.  Of all the days for you to show up late.  First, the idiot April calls in sick.  Then I got a bad tooth...
 Two pots of coffee...
...well, most of the time he looks like something the cat might have dragged in, but, you know...

Hit it...
Great.  All right...
Colonel, sir, who the hell is this guy?
Is Elvis out?
That little geek is my...
And where are you going?
I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.

...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
...back...
...without caution...

Yeah, I just....
...you, Mason?
If you're not out of there soon, I have got to seal the...
So, Mason, last Wednesday night, uh...were you out...
Lying? 
...beer.
...stole a truck under arrest.
 Listen, Pappas...
What the hell was that?


 We've gotta take out Brynner's van before  they reach...
I'll stay here and secure this position.
I'll settle for L.A. County.
How did she get that idea?
...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
No.
Well, you don't look any the worse for wear, Mr. Gittes, I must say... where's the girl?...
Where is she?
Haven't the faintest idea.
How do you do that?
You've got her? Where?
You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.
What kind of guy do you think I am?
Sure thing.
In the garage.
Sure, as soon as we eat.
How much do you owe me, Curly?
You're behind the times, Jake. They've got steam irons now.  And I'm out of Chinatown.
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
Absolutely.
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
Give you three minutes.
Not that Mulwray?
Would you like something to drink?
That's not his apartment.
So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar?  Lemon?
You see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and I want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I'd like to see your husband. Unless that's a problem.
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
Oh, yeah?
Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
Boy oh boy, you're a mess.
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
The Albacore Club.
What did he say?  What did he say?
J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar
You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
Yeah... where are you taking her now?
I'll take care of it.
...where does Kyo live?
On his day off. Get the exact address.
How do you know?
Where'd he go yesterday?
Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
Just to be certain, I wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
Mind if I take one of your cards? In case I want to get in touch with you again.
I don't understand.
Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes. We're... well, we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley. As you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we've had to cut them off. The city comes first, naturally.  But, well, we've been trying to help some of them out, keep them from going under. Naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff.
I said, the northwest valley.
Do you know me?
When it comes.
Yeah.
Gittes?... Gittes?
How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?
All right, what's your husband's first name?
This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray. It takes time.
He did or he didn't?
He owned the water department?
He owned the entire water supply for the city?
How did they get it away from him?
What about?
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
Neither do I.
That right?... She used to be some looker.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
That's for sure.
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
Alfredo, did you know my father?
I told my mother you weren't the one who gave me the films. That it wasn't your fault. But I thought you said the film could catch fire just to scare me. Now that I know, I won't steal any more from you. That's all I wanted to say. I'm going. 
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.
Eh! Love...what a mystery!  I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants... 
Thanks for all you've done for me.
Good morning, father. It's hard on the feet, huh?
My name's Salvatore...And yours?
Hi, Elena!
You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.
Daddy's not coming back...He's dead. 
Toto, this is no film for the common herd. One day'll be more than enough...So tonight, please set up tomorrow's film, so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready.
That's fine, Mr. Kane.
Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low...  Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -
It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein.  A new broom sweeps clean.
So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh?  Especially the new papers -
Sure, sure.
Who else did you see?
I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein.  You people work too fast for me!  Talk about new brooms!
Wasted?
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him?  He wanted you to.  He said to me just yesterday -
Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me ask you a few questions, and answer me truthfully.
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
Hello, Mr. Leland.
But, Mr. Kane -
And the notice?
The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad -  I shall be here in the morning.
What story, Mr. Rogers?
Hello, Brad -
Almost two to one -
Emily, you're being - a little unfair -  You know what I think of Charles' behavior - about your personal lives -
Emily, you -
I know it is, Brad -
I intend to find out.
You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you?
Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me -
There's only one person in the world to decide what I'm going to do - and that's me.  And if you think - if any of you think -
Get out, both of you!
Thanks.
A chicken?
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be.  I was once.  Sometimes you get me to believing I never was.
Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -
"Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast."  You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast.
I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company.
Get Dr. Corey.
Close the door, Raymond.
The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper.
Charles, I tell you there is no war! There's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -
Why not?
Charlie!  Now you're not making sense.
Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't agree anymore.  I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.
I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help.
All right.
You talk about the people of the United States as though they belonged to you.  When you find out they don't think they are, you'll lose interest.  You talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty. Remember the working man?  You used to defend him quite a good deal. Well, he's turning into something called organized labor and you don't like that at all.  And listen, when your precious underprivileged really get together - that's going to add up to something bigger than - than your privilege and then I don't know what you'll do - sail away to a desert island, probably, and lord it over the monkeys.
That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?
She can leave me.  As a matter of fact, I've already left her.  Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
Hello, Brad.
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. You'll be leaving on Number Ten.
Sorry, Mr. Thatcher!  What the kid needs is a good thrashing!
Mr. Leland, you were -
Brief marriage!  Ten years! 
Well, that's about all there is - and I'm getting chills.  Hey, nurse!  Five years ago, he wrote from that place of his down South -  - you know.  Shangri-la?  El Dorado?  Sloppy Joe's?  What's the name of that place?  You know...  All right. Xanadu.  I knew what it was all the time.  You caught on, didn't you?
On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
You can go on asking questions if you want to.
What do you think all that is worth, Mr. Thompson?
Who told you you could sit down here?
Why don't you people let me alone? I'm minding my own business.  You mind yours.
I did a lot of singing after that. I sang for Charlie -  I sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that, I didn't -
He was in love with me.  But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
Unnhh!
Jesus!
You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.
Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.
You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
You can hold me down.
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
Dick.
You're kidding.
Hey Caitlin...  Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you. Nothing personal.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
He was?
I was here the whole time.
Nobody! I swear!
Why?
My God. I haven't seen you since... 
It's not what you think.
No.
You don't have anything to do with it.
Look how full of yourself you are.
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
You mean, on a date?
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
You're such an asshole.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
Promise me it'll always be like that.
This is the last time I come to this place.
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
What the fuck is this?! I want some service!
Are you open?
Well, he missed!
Pack of cigarettes.
Dante, let me grab a Gatorade.
All right. Jesus, you fuckers are pushy.
Some guy just came in refusing to pay late fees. He said the store was closed for two hours yesterday.  I tore up his membership.
Want something to drink? I'm buying.
You don't want to know.
All four?
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
I guess.
Yeah.
The women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date. As if somewhere-beyond all the other gallons-is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade.
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
Because you buckled.
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
Julie Dwyer died.
I haven't seen her in almost two years.
Number six.
Why not?
You hate people.
You were saying?
She was pretty young, hunhh?
An embolism in a pool.
Shut the hell up.
Who found him?
His dick was in his mouth?
You know what? I don't think I care for your rationale.
The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
I like to expand my horizons.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
You're happy?
You're happy to get a fine?
What did she say?
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
You just fucked a total stranger?
She said she did all the work.
This life?
You should shit or get off the pot.
Am I right or what?
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
How do you figure?
To talk to you.
I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.
I'll call you. Let you know.
Get the fuck outta here already.
Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.
I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape.
Oh for God's sake!
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! Hey!
And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
What's that mean?
So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like "A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there." That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?
You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
And I actually date you?
It better be up to and including me.
What the hell was that for?
Three?
You've only had sex with three different people?
Shit! Why are we getting up?
Why do you call him that?
Like you said-she snowballed him.
But... but you said you only had sex with three guys! You never mentioned him!
How many?
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
I feel sick.
He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class?
Really?  You're the best.
Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
What the fuck did you do that for?
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
Thanks. I thought I was gonna have to go to the hospital.
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
Did he say "making fuck?"
What part of Russia?
I think the lady called it.
Feel that.
It's probably from being around all this food every day.
I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh.
The guy ain't here yet.
Twenty bucks?
Willam!
Gabe!  Hey, man!  Gabe!  It's Gabe!
C-4?
Hal's signalling he's OK.
If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
Jessie, Jessie, copy?
You know how the airlines are.
Tucker?
Jessie!  Are you alright?
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
I love you, too.
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
We'll never know, will we?
Forget me.  If you can, get away.
Take the gun.
She's tough.
There you go.
Please -- oh, no -- please!
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
I was there, you were the only one who didn't panic.  So do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt.  You held on as long as you could.  Yes, everything did go wrong, starting with Hal. I mean, what was he doing up on the Tower with a girl who could barely climb?
I don't understand?
Resuscitation?
Gabe!?
That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.  Why'd you have to come up here?!
I can't believe you just said that.
It was great.
They'll kill him!  He has no idea!
We might be able to go that way.
Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.
These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300.  I'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold.
Never, what?!
Gabe!
There's no "we".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
Wrap it around that rock twice.
An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
Murdering, motherfucker...
You said there was a way across.
He never hurt anybody.
Yeah...
Then where the fuck is!
You and Frank get the tents, thermal clothing, and medical supplies together.
You're looking at him.
What the hell are you doing--
Kill me?  Christ we're partners in this!
Why?  What are you going to do?!
Don't use my name!
Where's the third one, Travers?
Man against nature, right Travers.
This way.
Why the hell are we wasting time here?!
Sorry about the pain. Using the gulliver to much like, eh? Giving orders and disciplining and that perhaps, eh? You sure the pain's gone? You sure you'll not be happier back up in bed.
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, if it isn't little Alex. Long time no viddy, droog. How goes? Surprised are you?
Look, sir. I'm sorry to have troubled you. I think I ought to be going, sir. Julian bars the way.
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
Who said that?
She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old in-out, real savage. But quick as a shot came the sickness, like a detective that had been watching around the corner and now followed to make his arrest. Alex retching. Minister rises.
Not feeling too bad now are you?
I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Where is he now, sir?
Well, who can blame them, sir?
Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you.
Hey, Dad, there's a strange fella sitting on the sofa there munchy- wunching lomticks of toast.
Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell.
Crime?
Brown hair, is it?
Blue eyes?
Are you an Epileptic?
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.
How are you feeling today?
Yes?
Yes. Yes, well don't think about it too long, just say the first thing that pops into your mind.
How many did I get right?
You needn't take it any further, sir. You've proved to me that all this ultra-violence and killing is wrong and terribly wrong. I've learned my lesson, sir. I see now what I've never seen before I'm cured, praise Bog!
Stop him! Stop him! A leg is stuck out and Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over him.
If thou lose hope being weary in the days of distress, thy strength shall be diminished.
I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.
Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.
One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.
Don't read it - sign it!
Yeah... Pete the English.
Enough is remembered though, little Alex. Dim and Georgie laugh. They drag Alex to a low water through.
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.
How many to a cell?
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block.
I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
The ride is free.
Go ahead, say it.
Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.
You're an anomaly in today's world, Max.  You're good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...?
You like being a lawyer?
But not now?
Not in a cab...  I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together...
...okay, Max, I believe you...I'll get out of the building...
Where are you, what floor?
He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.
You know Dmitri?
And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy.
What kind of question?
I see.  That was an important list, wouldn't you say?  The people on that list are being subpoenaed tomorrow by a federal judge.  And you "lost" it?
...goddamn it, you telling me this motherfucker's whacked three of our witnesses tonight...
...got off the phone with his dispatcher.  What an asshole. Cabbie's name is Max Rilke, been driving that cab for ten years...
They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
...if they're wrong?!
I'm...in...the...room, here.  Don't talk about me like I'm not in the room.
Oh.  Oh, thank God, hey!  Hey, guys, hey, help me out here!
You're kidding me.
Vincent <u>Farrell</u>, Assistant U.S. Attorney.  A passenger in this taxicab, and I'm reporting you to the DMV...
You hassling my driver again?
Uh, let's go to...  Hello...?
Mind if I time you?  What do I get if you're wrong?  A free ride?
Bullshit.  You probably know the light schedules, too.  Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing.  Five stops, one night.  I gotta catch a six a.m. flight.  I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures.  Why don't you hang with me?
I think he's dead.
You were going to drive me around. Drop me at LAX.  Never be the wiser. But El Gordo missed the elevator.  So we go to Plan B.  Pop the trunk.
Max.
What about that?
Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...
Music.
I don't know any Rwandans.
Who's that?
Lenny?  You're an asshole.
I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes.  Where's the button?  Under the dash?
Another collateral.
What you mean, no?
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
You get benefits?
I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
Yeah, that.
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
As in...? 
She must be some girl.
<u>Jerry</u>?  You didn't show last night.  First time ever.  Had me worried, boy.
Not for years.
You going to warn him?
You think I'm crazy.
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
I better get going.
It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches!  You've got to listen to me.
Hey...  I can't control it.  It's just, something that happened.
It's okay.  The guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store.  He had it coming.
Crown Victoria.  F.B.I. car.  A legitimate tail.
Nothing scary there.  Sorry.
You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
If my universe had a hub...
Here it is.  <u>Conspiracy Theory</u>  It just went out Tuesday.  Third issue this year.  I bet I struck a nerve.  Pissed someone off.
'On July 8, 1979, security forces under control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all American Nobel Prize winners. The men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles.  The sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.'
You're a Holden Caulfield fan.
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
What are you doing?
Johnny Dancer, right?  You don't ride him anymore, do you?  Not since your dad died.
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
Elaborate on 'they,' okay?
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
You will?
I don't know what to say.  I love you.
I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
Oh, Christ, here it comes.  Look, I know you think I'm crazy.  I don't think I am, but...
You look great.
My father's house.
Liza?
Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?
How'd you get the picture?
I'm sorry.
Liza?
Don't die on me, Jerry.  Okay?
They changed Franklin's portrait.
I love you, too.
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
Excuse me?
<u>Why you</u>?
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
What I'm about to tell you is partially documented.  The Freedom of Information Act saw to that. But much more of it isn't.  For reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, I'm going to share -- secrets -- with you. Repeat any of it and you'll simply bestow the title of 'paranoid' upon yourself.
Years ago, I worked for the C.I.A. in the M.K. ULTRA program.  Are you familiar with it?
Jerry told me he bit your nose.
Belief is immaterial.  What's important is the truth... It's been my job to find Jerry.  I'm very much responsible for him.
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
Yes.
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza.  What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions.  We're out.  Shut off. Terminated.  <u>Understood</u>?
Guy's a C.I.A. shrink.  Here to I.D. Fletcher.  They knew each other somehow.
You're welcome!  Spooks.  So, you want to compare notes on this guy.
Do you believe me?
I want to believe you, too.
Jonas builds assassins for a living.  Several of whom may be in place already.  We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?
That you come with me.
We have benzel activation, repeat, we have benzel activation.  Control to Arroway, you okay in there?  Repeat, Control to Arroway, come back.
We've lost contact.
There's no plug to pull.
Is it possible...?
Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations.  If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements.
I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year.
... could it be a nested code of some sort?
Throw a gray scale on it; standard interpolation.
I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
What?
Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair...
There's no way of knowing.  Without a key -- a primer, to help us, maybe never.
What?
Got a bogey, boss?
Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker.
How's the spying tonight, guys?
It's how I hear it.  The display's just a little something I programmed for astronomers with the misfortune of sight.
Can't we get rid of them?
... I don't understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
Please answer the question, Doctor.
Could we hear to the moon?
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
So who...?
So.  What happens now?
That isn't the way it works.
No more stalling, Captain.
It's time to go home now.
Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?
A machine.  But a machine that does what?
A sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes.
What's that?
You sound like Joseph.  You think the world ends with the millennium?
Hokkaido Island.
Sounds like a Russian general.
... We've been going after some of the big multi-nationals but without much luck; got a donation from a New York dowager... We've even been thinking about selling T-shirts.
It's almost there.  The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.
The V.L.A.?
Greenbank?
Someone tell me this is really happening.
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
Peter... What is going on?  Has everyone gone completely insane?
How do you mean?
I flinched.
That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
How do you mean?
Ellie, what is it?
What?
Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor?  Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?
So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
But --
I want to, Palmer -- more than anything.  But it has to be real. It has to be true.
I don't know.  If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  It was still searching for meaning...
Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to your opinion.  But we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown, completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless.
... as have all attempts at internal analysis.  We've tried sonargrams, magnetic resonance, gamma rays; it's completely impenetrable.
I don't know.  Maybe we built the damn thing wrong.  Maybe it was all a hoax...  The safest thing would probably be to do a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.
I'm lucky I got a broom. Work up top. Real easy job. Man, it's gonna be hot down in that ditch.
Well, Arletta, I got to stand down here.
You never thought that's a heavy load?
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
Lookit her bounce.
Go hard!
Tell us about it.
Then how come it ain't done yet?
I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.
You was to sell your job, maybe this Lucas War Hero would give you a price.
Had it done in Singapore. Bunch of us drunk as coots --
Looka that! Two of them. Oh my...
A cold drink.
Well, whatta we got here?
Plumb busted out. Looks like the hard road finally got to Mister Lucas War Hero.
Course not. He ain't in the box 'cause a the joke played on him. He's there 'cause he back sassed a Free Man. They got their rules and we ain't got nothing to do with that. Woulda probably happened to him sooner or later, to a complainer like him. He's gotta learn the rules same as anybody else.
Maybe he's been chain-ganging too long.
Lucille? Where do you get that?
I'm gonna kill you, you go on...
Why'd you have to say fifty? Why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.
'Atsa sign I got me an affectionate nature.
Look at Him go. Bam! Bam!
Don't hit me no more, Boss! Don't hit me! I'll do anythin' you say but just don't hit me! Oh Luke. You are an original, you truly are. You really fooled them.
Whoee, it's cold. Wisht I had somethin' to eat. Bread, grits, beans even. Soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then I'm gonna show you some farm girls that...
Dragline gives out the names here. You'll get yours when he figures you out.
Koko, write down their names, don't just make marks.
Man! It's gonna be one hot muther today.
I'm in.
Cuter again.
Man, you play like a kokonut. You got to call him at least.
Back a buck.
But -- but --
Koko, why don't you let one of these Newmeats take your broom for today?
You ain't man enough to wear them!
Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.
I hate this...
You threatened to drive her downtown.  She has agoraphobia.
I got it myself... I couldn't wait.
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
Oh, God.  I must have looked horrible.
I can't, Andy.
The moon is up, my night to howl. Will you be okay?
You bastard!
She just got to sleep.  Do you have to tell her about it now?
The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
The first two murders.
When he was seventeen.
Who are you?
You break into her apartment to deliver a gift?  Where is it?
Where is it?
The door was already open...
She's supposed to have it.
Mm-hmm.  I can't get to you.  You have to come to me.
I want to tell you it's a great honor to meet you and talk to you.
That's amazing.  A whole new book, thought up in a minute.  Very good.  All I know how t do is get up, take a shower, and go to work. Hope, if he does another I'll nail the son of bitch, and they'll spell my name right in the newspaper. Where is Andy going?
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44.  It's Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?
A man?  I thought he was a boy.  This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why?  It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.  Son of a bitch <u>married men</u>!  Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!
The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes...
Why can't I drive home?  I will. You.  Look at you.  <u>You</u> need a ride home.  And you don't even know it.
That computer's wired into INTERNET.
It's gone.  The file's not here.  What did you do?
Yes.
We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day...
Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later.
What am I wasting my time with this shit for?
It's none of my business anymore...
My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
You got a tape backup, yeah, here lemme copy it on tape...
She wants me to check the phone booth for a note.
So what have we got?
You have no authority to make a deal like that.  That' s for the D.A...
Saks.  If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.
I just got here myself, Susan.
Did you come?
If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
Where's the car?
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
He must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his. It's like a bed on wheels. It must smell of semen...
Do you find him attractive?
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
Have you seen his penis?
You haven't told me where we're going.
The Road Research Laboratory? Where they simulate car crashes?
Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?
Please finish your story.
There's still a patch of blood there on the road. Did you see it?
No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus' Facel Vega, or Nathaniel Nest's station wagon, Grace Kelly's Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't touch anything else.
It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why.
What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project.
He must have driven through a pool of blood. If the police stop you again, they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed. Vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood.
I'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.
Do we have to talk about this?
The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
Look, I know he's almost through with treatment here. And, he's on medication.
What?
It was just a little going-away gesture.
She says she won't even come if Dad brings Monica.
Oh, wait a minute, now I see where you're going.
Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could throw you an engagement party maybe.
What about this one?
Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.
How can I help?
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
Do we have to talk wedding details?
Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
I was so sure. I really thought it would work.  We have plans, Ruth.
Will you get time off to do that?
Tell us every detail.
Oh no.
I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.
Ruth's already taken him home.
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic.
Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
Honestly, Letty.
Michael just got a job.    Couldn't you congratulate him?
You've been so great. I just feel a lot clearer about things.
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
Chair, cup and ball.
What if it's got a pattern?
It's no big deal.   We all compare.
You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner.
John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk.
Really, this isn't funny.
A small price.
We're supposed to be asleep.
Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes.
What else would you do?
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
I do.
First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
Where to?
Michael.
Not yet.
The store was busy.
Aunt Lily is the one who married your father's cousin?
I sure know what that feels like.
But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.
What are we going to do?
Would that really be such a good idea for either of us?
So, another one bites the dust.
Yeah?
I was thinking dinner on Friday with James and Meg at the Saint Mark.
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
What are you doing?    You're going to be late.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
You know what I think we need? Martinis. How about martinis to celebrate?
Exactly. It's time to make decisions.
You what?
Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.
Who?
It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over.  And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.
Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
What are you doing?
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Zero.   That's all I know.
You've already robbed the safe?
Good. I'm doing good. How you doin', Frankie?
Can I offer you something.    A drink? Coffee?
Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
Okay.   How much?
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
Someone else coming?
You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
And for my help I would get what?
I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.
What kind of business?
You know what makes a good get away driver?  Being able to get away!
Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
Bring me the scissors.
Do they come with batteries?
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.
I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine.
We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.
Hadley --
Hello?
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
Did you have to use that much explosive?
I've got a way with people.
He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me.
But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
This kind.
No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
I'll drive.
A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther.
You lived there. You know the city.
You guys used to work together?
This is great. After everything we've been through we've got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball.
What happened?
No.   It's mine.
I would like to thank you for your hospitality.  If you are ever in Paris here is my number.
I said knock it off! Now as far as I'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we've got to figure out what's going on.
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that?
I can't even hear myself think.
It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.
The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
Who's gonna see it there?
What are you doing?
Who are you waiting for?
Frankie, I --
She seems pleasant enough.
Okay.    Okay.
Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?
Do you think you are a real master?
And if I use them to kill you?
You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain.  You know... you've gone as far as you can go.  I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.
Please sit.
This spells trouble.
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
I've missed you.
Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
Where is he now?
Stop it!  You don't deserve the Green Destiny.
Give it back!
Well, there used to be!  What's your name?  I'm Lo.  The Hans call me Dark Cloud.  I'm not that tall or big, but I'm quick as lightning.
I don't take orders from anyone.
Mu Bai...It's been too long.
Good.  And how are you?
Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain.  He said you were practicing deep meditation.
You were enlightened?
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
You think Jade Fox will show up?
Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence.  My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.  Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.
What happened?
Mu Bai, hold on.  Give me some hope...
Save your strength.
We know who stole the missing item. If the thief returns it, I'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further.
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.  Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.
You're mistaken.  We're just street performers.  We were rehearsing.
You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.  Please accept our thanks.
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
I don't know...
I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?
But the sword could be in his compound.
Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones.
What in the hell... do you call that?
You okay, man?  I mean, what just happened.
They couldn't do anything for me.
Mom --?
Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man.  I nearly had a fucking heart attack.
You look like a rock star without a job.
What's going on...?
You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.
I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
What's goin' on, Elly?
You cut her.  You raped her.  You watched!
Top Dollar.
Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.
I wish to possess what you have now.
Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury.  And it turned out to be you. At last.  I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them.
Neither.
Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
Who got himself what?
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
Annette, how long have we known each other?
You promise not to say anything?
I must say I found it rather appalling.
Oh really?
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
Thank you.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
Do you deny that there's an attraction between us?
Need a lift?
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York.
No, not at all.
Okay?
It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?
I do.
That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person.
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
I just came to say goodbye.
How am I a hypocrite?
Why aren't you understanding?
You don't know how to love.
But you knew this was important to me.
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
Outstanding.
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
That was cool.
That's so romantic. Have you responded?
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
Who is it?
If that's what you call it.
Cecile, you had an orgasm.
Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.
My father just took me on a trip to Australia.
What are you doing?
I was just kidding.
Just a kiss, right?
But -
Want to join me?
Am I suppose to be this sore?
Want a blow job?
Don't you want to change that?
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
Good luck, Sebastian.
Hi, mom.
Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
Yes!
McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.
Pleased to meet you.
What do you do? Tell her you love her.
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
I don't find this very funny,
Why not?
I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.
Fuck her yet?
Loser.
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
Moving along quite well.
Before we go through with this, I just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause.
You amaze me.
Bad time?
You didn't?
P-whipped, p-whipped.
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
That's not fair. You're taking all the fun out of it.
How have you dumped girls in the past?
Well done.
To my triumph, of course.
Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.
I got your message and came as quick as I could.
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
Let me get that for you.
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
She's not here.
What time is it?
Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.
Hey Ronald.
Did you hit her?
to a situation) Really, Mr. Reed, there isn't anything to worry about. It was only a slap --
It's perfectly normal for a child to dream. I can see how a sensitive little girl, finding this portrait, would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend. That image dwells only in her imagination, and that image can go as quickly as it was born.
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
Did you mail then?
What do you want. Amy?
Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories  I'm sick of this sort of thing.
I'm sorry. Daddy and Mommy are a little upset.
These are all from me.
She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
She's there, just like I said she'd be.
I've wanted a friend.
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
You'll always play with me?
There's an oak leaf.  Add a maple.
light shining) in her eyes) Throw sea weeds into the flames, and the fire turns blue!
All right, Amy.  Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
Merry Christmas.
May I pet the deer?
Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
There was a deer on the other side of the fence.
Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
Because it can't. It's dead.
It got hit.
I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.
There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?
The Headless Horseman --
What?
You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.
But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.
There's a present you haven't opened yet, ma'am.
It all starts with them going to the bathroom together.
Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
Wow your body's really hot.
PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
How have you been feeling?
We're worried about you. "60 Minutes" was on same-sex couples.
Translation: a total geek.
Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret.
Maybe they have to pee.
I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
Why would they exaggerate?
So did you do it?
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
I thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses.
He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up.
Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
No he didn't. Come on, I don't want to be alone with those two. All they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me.
Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word "bag." It used to be "No, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. But now "my bag" means "my fault."
Frida, this is a bad time. We're having sex and George actually answered the phone.
Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
Get rid of him!
DON'T call the police.
How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
Why the fuck would you do that?
At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark.
What the fuck are we going to do?
Fall in love.
But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
I wish I only had your problems.
Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.
I know.
I do development for TV movies.
What?
You should have gone at the restaurant.
My apartment's just such a mess.
You don't have to pee.
I did something stupid. I had a courier job -- picking up a package from the airport. It turned out to be money -- so I kind of borrowed it to pay my rent and now these dudes are after me.
These guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. They're the kind that'll break my thumbs.
Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
Mark.
Wow.
You busted me.
You wanna get some coffee?
Oh, it's nothing.
It's stupid.
Yeah. Maybe.
What are those?
What are they for?
You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?
Is it that funny?
Is that how you feel?
You didn't say it.
You know, I've never seen your cat.
Go away. I might hurt you.
I knew you wouldn't kill me.
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
I'm going to take a shower.
No, it was our first date.
No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.
No, I have a cat.
Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.
You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?
This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
He means the last that we know of.
It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
How long have you been here?
All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him.  She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute.
To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this.  Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...
Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he needs expert help.
It seems fine.
I don't know who they are.
Can't let you in...  sorry.
Where does it lead?
No.  I, ah...
Bad dreams?
Known me for long?
What are you hiding?
How do you know I'm innocent?
You understand what you'll be doing?
Uh --Mr. Alexander?
Is this dangerous or anything?
Now, remember -- keep it simple.
First thing we're gonna work on is the mannerisms.  Alan has put together sort of a training program
Dave...
Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
What do you think you're doing?!
You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
Fine?
Die, you pond scum!
A condition...
Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
What about the wife?
Nobody's got clean kids.
Okay, let's see... you can have him on Tuesday the 25th...
When does it break?
So you want to go swimming?
They could put you in jail.
In fact, we think you did such a good job, we'd like to extend things a little bit.
Will he be alright?
No.
You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...
In the car.
Dave...
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
Fine.
What do you mean you made it all up?
This is wrong, Alan!
And it's proving quite effective...
Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
The Fidelity nonsense...
They re not my attack dogs.
... Sometimes they do.
You ever think back to how you started.
So, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the First Lady?
You got a gun?
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
Well...
You bet.
In fact,  I'm not anything like him and... I guess I want you to know that.
Well I guess...
They're crucifying you out there.
You really believe that?
I saw you on T.V... at his funeral.
So this is it?
The Monroe?
Did you get someone to double for me there, out front?
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
It's some kind of....elevator. There must be something under the ground here....maybe....military.
You'd hold us back. We have to go on.
Tonight?
There's no place like this place. Warm climate. This facility. Christ, there ain't nothin' like this no-damn-where! Even the Feds knew that. That's why they stored so much o' their shit down here. It's all mine now. All mine. Just let 'em try ta come after us down here, which they will some day...take a likin' ta what all we got an' come after us. They'll hafta get past my army! An army that ain't afraid ta die...ha ha ha...'cause it's awreddy DAID! HA HA HA HA....
That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course.
Thanks. I can fight my own battles.
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
How long do we have to watch him?
What?
That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages.
That's the general alarm. Jesus! They musta got in!
But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them!
One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
Dios mia.
You're....you're disgusting! You're....FILTH!
I had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. In fact...you might say that Mr. Tyler is in big trouble with the...authorities.
It's because of me.
I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
Where are you going, Tyler?
No time for that. I'll take care of them.
Well, I'd better find Patsy.  Say hello to Mutt for me.
I'm in as long as we're careful.
Why doesn't he let you do what you want?
Can you believe it?  She was gonna call me!  She invited me to a party with her!
Well, welcome to "Hell"ton.
He flatters me so I'll help him with Latin.
Well, of course not.  It's just that... You could have warned us.
Oh God, it's over now!
But what if they see it, Nuwanda?
I here and now commit myself to daring!
Yes sir.
Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.  I'm just saying
I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately."  I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life!"
Nuwanda, what is going on?
That's your sister school, right?
Well, sure!
Ginny Danburry's here.  Look for her.
Chris!
Look, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late for the play.
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
What is that?
The hoi polloi.  Doesn't it mean the herd?
Boys marching.  Clapping in unison.
John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
A yawp?
Good god, boy! Yell!
Todd, there's a picture of Whitman over the door.  What does he remind you Of? Quickly, Anderson, don't think about it.
A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.
Why do you do it?  I mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something?
You really think I should forget her?
All right.  Jesus, what are you gonna do?
Where are you going?
But father, it's not fair.
Father!
Want to come to the study group?
Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me.
I know that.  What's it got to do with you?
So?
Come on, that's impossible.
But if he said no before then...
By the way, there's a meeting this afternoon.  You coming?
No, I want you in.  But being in means you gotta do something.  Not just say you're in.
Todd, what's the matter?
This is your desk set.  I don't get it.
Look, Todd, you're obviously under- estimating the value of this desk set.
Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!
We don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw Billy!
You remember the first time we met Finnegan? I think you were just starting out...smuggling gold off Sumatra for those two Chinese...what did we use to call them?
The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
Speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
Great woman your mother. Real foresight.
Where are my men?
Who gives a shit about aft?
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
You don't have to be so touchy.
Got it?
The "come back" kind.
I was so goddamn close, Finnegan! So goddamn close to my island... I could almost taste the sand...
I don't mean to drop in unannounced ...you ready...
Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...
Let's just keep going.
The hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable...
I think he knows that Joey.
You know what I'm gonna do after this...I'm gonna get a normal life...
Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!!
Not even a Joey, I'm glad to see you? Joey, what happened to your leg?
I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next...
Was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to...
Where are you going?
You know what my goal is? Before I die I want to make love to a woman from every country on earth.
Someone's back there.
She fucked me too.
You want 'em?
Yes, Albert?
Who's going?
Nick's going?
Sweet! Oh, that is sweet!
And we want you to know, Sal, that any help you might need--
What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, Albert. Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!
You, Vince! You! You are! You're a crock! You're a walking, talking crock!... I mean, what do you know?
In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.
Whee-uu!
Did you ever think life would turn out like this?
I have to go.
See, I'm going home.
No. None of that.
Boy, do I love this conflict. Huh?... What the hell were you doin' in there?
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.
Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em!
Sal.
Why?... What do you mean?... Why???
Please! Please mister, please! This is vital I go to Saigon. This is very important. Most important.
Sit with Linda, man, will ya?... Give her a beer.  Would you like a beer?
What kind of beer would you like?
How are you?
Frost.
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
How extremely clever. That is really most extraordinaire... Allow me please to introduce myself. I am Armand... And you are?
You should have put that on last night.
That way it sets.
What do you think about?
Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you think's a yo-yo! They're all yo yo's. I mean they're all great guys, for Christ's sake, but... The point is, Nick, without you I'd hunt alone. Seriously. I would. That's what I'd do.
Tomorrow I go with Vince.
I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.
Bullshit! That's bullshit!
I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
No.
That's it. No. No way.
Great. That's great.
What's that noise?
Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and you're gonna die!... I'm not saying it's gonna be the same. It's not gonna be the same, but whatever it's gonna be we're all gonna do it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are gonna do it!
You didn't get a deer?
Yeah.
How're you guys... I mean, how've you guys been?
You're full of shit!
And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?
Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
Who is it?
Funny guy.
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
I worked for him... still do.  Said he'd make sure I was left alone if I helped put Wade away.  He kept his promise for twenty years.
You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop it?
You can't kill me.  I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow.
This is a war, Wade.  You against him.  Vengeance time.  The City's just in the way.  Kill the fucker. You and me.  We'll work things out when the time is right.
I'm wasting time.
Kill him... kill him.
Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?
You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.
Got it.  Ejection seat?
Hey, I'm eating.
You want to be a good detective?
Part of Doucet's cerebellum, a portion called the vermis is under- developed.  This area rates response to outside stimuli.  Com- pare it to that of a normal law- abiding citizen.  It could be why he kills.
You're not pregnant, are you?
Kid, you ever been in a high speed chase before?
What's this?
Sanchez...?
No.  I want to be with you.
You should be in hospital.
But he was such a good cop.
Yes.
Hey, you! Watch out there -- you're scuffing my Brussels carpet -- Consarn them.
You're not resting well, are you? I know -- it's that music.  You need your sleep. Is there anything else you want?
You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
Hello, Colonel! Want a lift?
Gee -- that Fair --
Granny, when do we move to the new house?
Lan's to goodness, what happened to that hen? Did you use that beanshooter again?
Grandma, look at me!
Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
Say ... about the interest ...
Loan shark -- hey?
Sure does. But I'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights.
Mornin', Jabez ...
Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.
You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
What does it mean here -- about my soul?
Why, Mr. Stone, you look so worried. Can I be of any service?
Jabez Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document?
Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?
Mighty good of you to come out, Squire -- sparing all this time to --  Sheriff, too -- and Schoolmaster -- mighty nice.
Well, Jabez -- I'm a little pressed for time. You wanted to discuss something -- some business --
Yes.
Yes  siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: "Look, folks -- here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor." Golly, I can see their eyes pop already.
Mary -- it's gone.
To save us work on the spring plowing?
Jabez!
I'll get the doctor.
Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
We must go on home, Jabez.
Mary --
But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
Mary --
What happened.... Where are you taking him?
My fault? ... Oh, Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.
Think this room is larger than anything Webster's got at Marshfield? You've been there. What about it, Mary?
Mary! Come back ...
There! Guess that ought to hold good. Put him down here, by the fire, Mary.  But we don't want to get him too close -- we'll have roast pork for supper.
Helps sometimes to say it.
Hush up such talk, Jabez!
Well -- that's comforting!  Supper.
It won't be the first baby ever born in this house.  There! Made me drop a stitch!  Sit down, you make me nervous!  Lan's, that's the way a man always is. Thinks his son's the most important thing in the world.
I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.
What's that you say, Son?
Come in, Sheriff.
Well, I guess we won't be going to church today.
You know, Ma, why the Squire came to see Jabez?
She'll do nothing of the kind! She's going to church with me, right away!
So you've made up your mind to go to the party.
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
Oh -- Mr. Webster -- I'm so glad you came!
There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy. 
There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!
I want someone to talk to ...
So, you go on upstairs to the party, your lady sees you, you run into each other's arms.  Music comes up, you live happily ever after, that it?
John, they're giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you. I know you think you're doing your job, and I can appreciate that, but you're just dragging this thing out. None of us gets out of here until these people can negotiate with the LA police, and they're just not gonna start doing that until you stop messing up the works.
You're very perceptive.
I know what you are feeling.  But this is not productive --
He wasn't lying about Marco:  He's thirty stories down on the street. The other man is Heinrich, and I found his body upstairs.  And his bag is missing.
-- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance --
The code key, please...?
I'm afraid not.  But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you?  Just another American who saw too many movies as a child.  Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion.
Hear that?  Talk to me, where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later...  ...I might get to someone you do care about.
You...you're an American?
Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.
How long?
You better heat up that miracle				* you were talking about.  We broke through on Number Six, and the Electromagentic came down like a sledgehammer...
Encourage them to be bolder.
I...have a request.
Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync.  I think it's me.  Is there a place I can wash up?
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
I'll be a few minutes.  Wait here --
Excuse me, I'm looking for --
'Roy'.
Hey, I love you.  So do a lot of the guys.  So hang in there, man.  Hang in there.
They way you drive, I can see why.
Is that him?
Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
So whatsa deal?
Jesus, you're the man!
I was lookin' at it.  I saw you, man!  Jesus!  You oughta see yourself!  You wouldn't believe it.
They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you.  I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you.
I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
...because you hurt me, God how you hurt me.  Can you imagine, marrying another man?  Did I do something to make you do that?  Did I ever turn you down, or anything?  The only thing I couldn't do, you're gonna laugh, is go on top - I got this fear of high places!  And I let myself get fat.
I know you can't stand me to say I'm fat.  Like I can't stand you being a bank robber.  I guess that's what love is -- huh, Sonny?
Sonny, there's somebody under that desk over there... I'm sorry...
Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.
Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
What am I supposed to do?
Denmark?  Sweden?
Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
They won't talk to you.
Yeah... yeah!
Yeah.
Who's this?
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore?
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
Let Sal come out, take a look. What hope you got?  Quit while you're ahead.  All you got is attempted robbery.
Calm down, you're not ...
The girl hostages.
What the hell you doin' back there?
Don't fuck with me ...
Just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body ...
We're all set at Kennedy.
Okay, is the vault open?
This is it?  What am I gonna do with this?  Holy shit!
Hey, you, manager... Don't get any ideas, fucker... See that man there? I bark and he bites!
Howard, give him the keys...
Don't ask me questions.  I got connections.  You find out who I am, you're cold meat.
Are we going to get the ball rolling?
I'm okay ... I'm okay ...
You know ... I like you people ... I really do.
Yeah.
Are you a lawyer?
I wish somebody would tell me I'm gonna live long enough for it to be a habit.  My parent, she'll be okay. My husband, he'll be okay.  I even know who the bum is gonna marry. Terrific.  She'll take good care of him.
Because I don't want cancer.
You gonna smoke the cigarette?
Where's the money?
It's the cops.  Shit!
... The bodies out the door.
Okay ... okay ... all right, Sal, it's okay.  I got everything straightened out ... it's gonna be okay.
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
Hey, Sal ... How you doin'?
Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
I want to come in, and see if everybody's okay.
Jesus, you'd like to kill me, too.
Nobody give their right name ... it's the FBI!
I ain't eaten all day.  I just realized it.
Oh, shit!  I gotta have time to think.
You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?
Not now, Mom, please.
Why are you doing this?
This is Drake Bishop.
Morning.
<i>They can do subtitles.</i>
Will you speak the fucking English language? The poor girl has no clue what you're talking about.  The boy speaks English, you know. Reads, writes, I swear it. He does this when he's around girls. Thinks it's cute.
Tell him it's not cute. Will you tell him, Domino!?
Oh! And another thing. I am a liar. A pathological liar. There was no day in Danang, no multiple tours in Nam. Just lies to get laid, lies to get respect.  Truth is... I'm scared shitless all the time.
Promise me... you won't ever tell Domino.
Hello?
I'm so sorry to be bothering you in the middle of the night like this... but it's a bit of an emergency.
Your son... and your nephew have been kidnapped by these crazy game show hosts from the Fox network. <b> INT. CIGLIUTI COMPOUND -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Cigliuti sits up in bed.
Why the hell are we delivering them out here? I can't even find any warrants in the system for these four.
Okay.
Claremont, you're a chubby chaser.
<i>Did you get all four?</i>
We need hostages. Celebrity hostages. Just in case this gets ugly. <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- LATER ON </b> The Cast Winnebago drives through the desert.
Hello?
Ms. Harvey... my name is Taryn Miles. I'm a criminal psychologist working for the FBI. I'm here to ask you a few questions.
You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
Are you aware that Lateesha Rodriguez has been running a counterfeit driver's license racket?
<i>You drove Lateesha's daughter to school... then dropped her off at the DMV. Why?</i>
<i>The bitch was bluffing. There were no dupe tapes. If there were... they'd have shown them to me by now.</i>
Not yet. <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Alf pulls onto the 15 FREEWAY.
<i>Either this was some kind of set up... or the First Ladies got scared... decided to pull out and cut their losses.</i>
The mold? I am living among these crypto-fascist Orange County cunts... with daddy's BMW and the boob job... just waiting to implode.
I refuse to turn out like them. Twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband.  Stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. They let the boys control their lives. Not me.
You can save that Pretty Woman shit. The name is Domino.
Everyone... please give Domino her space. Step back, please!
What did he say about the arm?
I don't like anything else.
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Ya back is got.
Yo!
I own a brownstone on this block.
I'm gonna leave now.
That's not even true.  I just want a slice.
And I--we--want some Black people up.
What did I tell ya 'bout dat noise?
Mookie.
How come you ain't got no brothers up?
It's been about a year.
The evil eye doesn't work on me.
Where did you sleep?
Oh, it doesn't, huh!  You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...
I'll do.
You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right.
Here ya are.  Keep the change.
Fool, you're thirty cents away from a quarter.  How you gonna get a boat?
You're raggedy as a roach.  You eat the holes out of donuts.
Sweet Dick Willie.
Let it be broke.
Mookie!  How is anybody gonna call in?
Sal, just this once, do me that solid.
Sal, I don't care if you fire me this exact minute, leave my sister alone.
Sal, just do me a favor, leave Jade alone.
I'm not guilty of nuthin'.
You're right, a kid is dead, but Mook, this isn't the time.
Do we now?
Mookie?
And I really wanted some ice cream too.
You a blue-moon fool.
What else?
Why you gotta curse?
What?
Where are you going?
Mookie, late again.  How many times I gotta tell you?
Just coolin'.
You deaf or what?
Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.
Dago, wop, garlic-breath, guinea, pizza-slinging, spaghetti-bending, Vic Damone, Perry Como, Luciano Pavarotti, Sole Mio, nonsinging motherfucker.
Brother, Mookie, if I love you I love you, but if I hate you...
I love you, my brother.
Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
You really think so?
Be on guard.  Mookie has Pop conned already, so we have to look out for him.
Hey!  Watch it.
Pop, stop lying.
The both of youse, shaddup.
Pop asked you.
Pop, I'm gonna go with Mookie.
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
Hey guys.
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
O'clock?
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
The name's Walter.
Wow, a treasure map! What's the treasure?
Oh, Harry, I'm so proud of you making a real friend.
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
I think it's just over there.
Oh my gosh, I don't think she's even wearing underwear!
Who's Principal Collins?
H A R R Y...
Wow! It's a half-boy, half-horse. The boys walk up to him, impressed.
Got any crazy eights?
Whoa. What was that?
Your mom made a move on me.
Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
Don't use that tone with me, young man.
I will stop this car right now.
You take that back!
...and who was Benjamin Franklin again?
Owww.
What?
Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?
Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?
I kinda screwed things up.
Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones.
By the way, did Captain Rob mention how I beat the crap out of him this afternoon?
You certainly did.
Are, too.
It's okay. I want the rush.
But my mom gave me the map.
I... found that rock.
What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
That's what Jessica was talking about!
Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?
Hey there goes Principal Collins!
Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!
What?
Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal.
I thought I told you to get lost.
My parents are going to wonder where I am.
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
Do I know you?
You really are a pirate.
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
What are you crazy kids doing in my tool shed?
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki.
No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class.
So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow.
You got the Extender?
Everything?
Baby, I'm going to spend the morning at the mall. You know, shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are you looking for?
The evidence of what?
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
So the chest is still out there somewhere.
A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes!
What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck.
Things have been so serious here lately.
You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck.
Sayyadina.  Our Reverend Mother tells me she is too old... She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest.  She asks that you pass within.
As the legend says.
Maker?... Maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? That was close...  Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great Mother, would not know the maker?
I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe that small rock.
Is he....?
Remember... walk without rhythm and we won't attract a worm... it'll go to the thumper.
Cinnamon... the spice!  Do you smell it?
Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
Always?
You have strength... real strength... You shall be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar.  This is your secret name in our troop.  But you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly.
Water on Arrakis!!! I have seen this place in a dream.  A treasure.
The Water of Life.
Long live the fighters!
 I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?
... Many men have tried.
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.
Greetings.  I am the Count.
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?
I can't believe this!  <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!
You know, I saw you perform "Dracula."  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life.  When is your next picture coming out?
They were <u>mythic</u>.  They had a poetry to them.  And you know what else?  The women prefer the traditional monsters.
Shh!  I'm coming!  I will feed you!
Ugh!  I hate the way she interrupts the pictures.  She doesn't show 'em the proper respect.
Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything.
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
Look, you seem a little agitated. Do you maybe wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk... and then we'll come back and shoot the scene?
How 'bout a western?  People love westerns.
Uh, a cop.  NO!  You play the father. He's <u>angry</u>!  He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his <u>daughter</u> behave this way!
Sure.  Romance, that's great!  To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures.  Once "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another!
No!  <u>Doctor Acula</u>!  You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor!  Not a count.
Should I call a doctor?
Is there anything I can get you? Water?  A blanket?
What's in the needle?
Goodbye!  Goodbye!
What is this place?
Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...
Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?
Eddie, this is quite a scene.
Why are you here??
Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?
I've got some good news.  The doctor says you're all better.  You can come home.
Sorry...
I envied him.  Hell, I envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
Eddie, I want to thank you.  These last few days have been a good time.
So guess where I'm going next weekend?
Jesus!  Are you serious?
Bravo!  Bravo!  Magnifico!
Incidentally, you <u>promise</u> you're not going to scratch my car...?
Honey, what if I'm wrong?  What if I just don't have it?
Sweetie, you won't believe it!  I've got the most incredible news!
Ed, I'm so proud!  I'll read it as soon as I get home.
How long have you been doing this?
It's a damn good role.
How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
All I wanna do is tell stories.  The things I find interesting...
Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.
It was the only way I could get the movie made!
I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
But there's plenty of other parts.
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry?  I blew it!  I thought she was rich.
Eddie, what's <u>my</u> motivation?
I'm tired of living on the fringe.
So what are you bringing me?  Looks like you got some film cans.
Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.
Mr. Wood?!
Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
Hey!  You're not eatink.
Tor, I should be getting home.
My eyes are killink me.
Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood!  So, what are you working on now?
Eddie, you must have me confused with David Selznick.  I don't make major motion pictures.  I make crap.
Yeah.  Crap with a star.
So have you always lived in L.A.?
Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?
I'd seen him in a coffin so many times, I expected him to jump out...
The left.  It's more natural.  Hey, I've got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  What would that be made of?
Those assholes.
But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck!
Wow, this lab looks great.  Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?
Hey.  This is looking good!  Paul, where's the octopus motor?
What are you, an angora wholesaler?
My goodness, you're embarrassing me.
I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --
No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
How's your mother?
Are things gonna be okay with you and Mom? Is there anything I can --
What?!
So?
I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
Yeah?
They tore her dress! ...
Ed, do you want my advice?
Take him off the air.
With all due respect, Cynthia you're nuts. I'm giving him another month!
Mr. Pekurny.
Al!
So he killed himself.
Send him away.
No.
You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left.
Eddie...
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
Ed! How did you know I was here?
She won't.
No! I barely even mentioned -it's just that, my friends, the people at work, whoever I'm regularly in contact with they want releases from.
How much less?
I batted!
Why do it?
Cream rinse?
You do though, you look great.
Really?
I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
It's not their fault.
Kinda'.
Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the "Ernest" movies?
Ray, maybe this isn't ...
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?
Who is it?
What is this? What's going on, who is that?
You brought the girl!
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
Good-bye, brother!
You don't recognize me.
Quite a shithole, isn't it?
I was in jail.
Check forging.
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
Ohh... do you own a cat?
Look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this?
Look, my life is not so great, that I want it shown on television. And neither is yours.
One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.
Don't you smartass me!  Don't you dare smartass me!  You just shut your mouth I  Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off the phone with him at home. You know, he doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't blame him!
Having a problem with your eye there?
You're kidding, right?
Mostly Tammy fans
He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more.
You know what they say about the early bird.
Well, good luck there, Tracy
Tracy.
Here they are.
Thanks for everything.
You're the advisor.  You should stop her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a sophomore.
I guess you know why you're here
I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
Yes?
Where to?
Handles pretty good, don't you think?
What's this?
Hmm?
Walt will be speaking with you about this, but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer.
Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
I don't believe you.
Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
points at the motel.
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Hey Yeah?
Right now?
We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.
Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was apples.  Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy.
Oh, no.  No.  I'm just finishing up here, and I've got to get home.
You said I was a liar   You're the liar, you're the --
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
Yes, Paul?
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
We're looking for three colored guys who like to pop off shotguns. One of 'em owns a purple Merc coupe.
Somebody hit you?
Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
Tell me about Patchett.
There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
Come in out of the rain, Bud.
We talked.
He helped me out once.  That's all.
Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.
Was it... a rat?
Where are we going?
How's it going to look on your report?
Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house.  The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down.
Dudley.
Dudley's guys.
We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.
Are you Pierce Patchett?
I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
That's right.
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
Should I?
How 'bout I give you your balls back?
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
What do you want to know?
If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
Anything?
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
Take it easy!  I didn't have anything to do with him getting killed if that's what you mean.
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships.
And?
That was his favorite toast.  I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.  You placed first out of twenty-three.
I... No.
I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father.
You should stay away from a man when his blood is up.
Sir, I took the call.  It's my case.
I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund.
<u>No</u>.
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
Have you discussed this with anyone else, John?
Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?
I need to speak to you.
Damnit... <u>What</u>?
Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
It's a simple question.
So what's the point?
High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
She is Lana Turner.
I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.
It galls you that I know so much about you.  You don't have information to compete.
I want to know why you see him. Is it a Patchett payoff?
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
When?
Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
It seems like my Susan, but...
Jack!  It's Christmas!
They're sitting in the dark, goofing on the Christmas tree.
The Grauman's Chinese pot bust. He just got off the honor farm.
Sid, why would a guy like Pierce Patchett get involved with running dope and hookers?
Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
Zavitz, what? You want your old job back?
Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
I'll come straight there.
It is?
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
You knew the deal. No contact.
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
Yes.
Wait. What do I do?
I'll pay you.
Get dressed. We're leaving.
I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.
Jesus!
What'd I tell you?
I intercepted phone calls.
They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.
Well, actually, <u>you</u> have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.
Here?
In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.
What the fuck?!
Gimme that.
Fuckin-A.
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
What if we hand deliver to their homes or office?
What if <u>what</u>?
What are you dialing?
He came in four minutes ago.
Baudmore Consultants.
Jerry's on vacation 'till Monday. I can give him the message when he gets back. That was Patrick and the last name--
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
Hi, Mr. Dean.
That's fine.
How 'bout Christian Dior?
I'll be right back.
For that matter, I think you will too.
I know, but--
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
What?
I'm sorry.
Stacy?
Stacy, don't hang up.
Does that hurt?
I was missing you.
I'm sorry about Rachel.
That ain't me.
And then what?
Never.
"Soon". Or at least sooner than never.
Thank you.
I got a call from my firm this morning saying don't come in.
There are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long I've worked for the mob. The <u>mob</u>, Bobby!
I can't.
I've never met him?
Any idea what he looks like?
Yeah?
Otherwise you may have to what?
Your shoe.
I don't <u>know</u> you, I don't <u>know</u> your name, I don't know <u>what</u> the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' <u>sick</u> of this! Get it?!
Who would do that?
Bobby--
I don't under--
She doesn't want to talk to you.
Excuse me, have any of you seen an eight year old boy, good looking, about yea-big.
Sure, go ahead.
In your dreams.
He's kidding.
Yeah.
They took the espresso machine. The <i>espresso</i> machine, Jerry! Which makes sense, you know, because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo.
No.
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
You gotta--
Bobby? Piece of advice?
It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--
Yes. But we can't.
What's your opinion?
What?
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
30 minutes ago you said we had him. What in hell's goin' on out there?
What about--
Jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body.
It was pulsing on your SAT frequencies.
Thank you.
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
You sing.  All the time.
This is not very good, is it?
- there is the Harmattan, a red wind. Which Mariners called the sea of darkness.  Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood. Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.
Geoffrey's not in Cairo.  He's not actually a buffoon.  And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government.  They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia.  In case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
You sew very badly.
Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!
This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine!  I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous.
I don't care to bargain.  It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing.
I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there?  How can you ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?
Shall we be all right?
Good morning!
If I could just see some identification.
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
I was talking about the girl.
I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
And I'm telling you there's nothing there to explore.
I believe I'm rather late.
How are you?
David Caravaggio.
Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a month, I don't know, also my leg was -
Or was it Toronto?
What do you want?
I could help you.  I could get you off that.
It's a week.  We didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or -
Hello.
Is it you?  If I said Moose I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you?
But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him.  And hearing his story, she said this -
I was just saying, I'm going to cable Downing Street, see if I can't stir up a few shillings - Katharine's mother and the PM's wife are best -
Of course.  Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
Before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me?
Are you asleep?
I can see my wife in that view.
Could I ask you to move?  I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry.
I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
You like him, don't you?  Your voice changes.
Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
I'll get another tin. Hana and the Patient are alone.
I was thinking yesterday - yesterday! - the Patient, Hardy: they're everything that's good about England. I couldn't even say what that was. We didn't exchange two personal words, and we've been together through some terrible things, some -  he was engaged to a girl in the village! - I mean -  and us - he never once He didn't ask me if I could spin the ball at cricket or the kamasutra or - I don't even know what I'm talking about.
The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
What's happening?  Am I needed?
Certainly not.
How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives.
What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.
What about your rank or serial number?
The windows don't open.
That's great if you're a computer. In the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. The building's 600 feet high.
You're saying the thief wants us to think it's Mac but it's really not.
I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
Where are you at least?
In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?
Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
I can't?
I don't want to waste your time.
You have a car?
Are you...okay?
I've got something for you.
It's a test.
Fine. What do I do?
How much am I paying?
But--
He says they turned the card down.
What the hell was that?
What about your bags?
You stole my luggage? You--
Nothing? You don't even lock the door?
Nice spot.
So the Duke dug a tunnel--just in case. They made the lake a hundred years later. Flooded the tunnel.
Someone was expecting that.
Why don't we take oxygen?
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
Won't take any time.
Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen.
Aren't we early?
To us. To the Mask.
How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then?
He wasn't.
One, two, three...
You can't be too careful.
Ready?
STOP! You're making...mistake.
Come on, what can you do with six billion you can't do with four?
You've got everything planned.
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
What's that?
The oscilloscope's already programmed.
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.
Done.  And I assume you have the magic CD- ROM?
You shouldn't have.
That's because you grew up rich.
Not for me.
The sign of our partnership.
Hang on.
They've been on to you all along. Knew you had a big job going.
Always in a rush.
I'm not real big on collecting banged up Ferraris at airports.
If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.
I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga.
This is just show and tell.
The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality.
Takes a lot out of you, one like this.
... what we do in here is keep track of all the case files.  That way, at any time, we can find out a case's status -- where it is in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em all here, alphabetically --
A million things could have caused those problems.  Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final and more than fair.
What's she doing here?
Fax these to this number, okay?
Seventeen thousand in debt.  Whew.  Is your ex-husband helping out?
Hi.  Donna Irving?
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
Thank you.  I think so too.  That's why I'm being such a stickler on this house price thing.  I don't mean to be a pain in PG&E's backside, especially after all they've done for Hinkley, but I look around here and I think, if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it.  And I don't just mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over.
Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know.  And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.
You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole family.  And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  They just took care of it.  Just like that.  We never even saw a bill.
Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick.
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
It's a good day.  I feel good.
Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
Okay -- let's try and settle down here.
I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
Yeah?
Out to lunch with the girls.
You do know how to do that, don't you?
How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
Oh, yeah?
Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
But, PG&E told her about the chromium?
So what made you think it was?
What medical records?
I didn't see any medical records in there.
I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed that send button -- PG&E claims department is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting.
At least they made an offer.
I don't get why they'd do that.
Boy, do I know how you feel.  First time I heard that number, I said you got to be kidding me.  Forty God damn percent?
Bullshit.
You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.
What now?
They covered 'em over.  And not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock.
Then they didn't know.  And if they didn't know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages. And punitive damages is where the money is.
I like this case.
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
I'll see what I can do.
Whoa.  No shit.
Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?
Why good?
If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.
So why would PG&E offer it?
Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --
Ed, I swear, I'm not --
Who's the judge?
Nope.  And I didn't ask.
Erin.  Cool.  What can I do for you, Erin?
You come to the right place.
Pattee?  That your middle name?
You know what, Erin?  I got nothing but time here.  Why don't you let me do that for you, and you can get your kids some dinner.
What kind of chromium is it?
Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
So that stuff -- it kills people.
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
County water board.  All righty, thanks.
What's going on in there?
There's no way a son of mine hates Funky Town.  It's impossible.
God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you doing out here?
I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
Annabelle Daniels.
Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a beautiful woman next door, I'da done this different.  Let's start over.  My name's George.  What's yours?
Which number do you want, George?
Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
What're you doing?
I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front door, too.  This isn't exactly the safest neighborhood in the world, you know.
What kind of person lives like this?  Huh? What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats?
You are someone.
It doesn't have to be this complicated, Erin.  There's a lot of jobs out there.
You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?
Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?
What?  Beth?  My Beth?
About this.
It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.  Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me.  That's a long time.
You already packed up your stuff?
They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just wanna keep an eye on me another night.
Hello?
You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick.
Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?
You're moving away?  When?
They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And these guys -- Donna and Peter --
Uh-huh.  Spent the last few days knocking on doors.  And you know what?  They're not.  I mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff.  And their pets are fine.  So I don't know -- I just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water.
It was .... the Emperor ....
Will he finish what he begins?
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
Will you?  You underestimate The Emperor.  It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer.
Three patrol ships are heading our way.
Turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.
Barks a doleful farewell.
... the power?
... Like we're being watched.
Yeah ...
Give me that!
Yes sir!
The temperature is dropping too fast.
What is thy bidding, My Master?
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on?
Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.
Stop that.
What are you afraid of?
There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
Looks like some kind of Mynock.
That depends.  Where are we?
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
Probe?  What probe?
I hope you make your peace with Jabba.
Why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you.
That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?
Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.
Get out of here, Lando!
This ought to be good.
Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?
It's a lovely outpost.
What about Han?
Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ...
What's going on?
Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.
Very noble.  Not smart, but noble.
You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.
What?
You rest now.
Sir, we've lost the rear deflector shield.  One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?
First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
This hyperdrive had better work.
Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.
But tell me why ...
What's in there?
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
Will they die?
There is much Obi-wan did not tell you.  Come, The Emperor will complete your training.
Good God.
So am I.  And I mean you no harm.
Do you have a name?
In some fashion -- and I lack the intellect to know precisely how -- we have traveled from Earth's future into Earth's past.
I mean he's of your race. He's an Ape.  Look.  You don't have to be afraid.  We've put him in chains and under sedation. Do you understand that?
Humans?
May I say something personal?
ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve.
His reactor's starting to overheat.
Who's that?
Cuervo...?
Give it.
It's so good to see you again.
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
I don't know, sounds thin to me.
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
Third World wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want. The Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make a run at the border, we got a full scale attack on the United States.
So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
Locked.
75% power.
Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype?
The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President.  Shall I begin evacuation?
You're a star in your own right, you know that? Hey, I'm Map To The Stars Eddie. How you doin'?
Too many people know where you're going, Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you.
Where is it?
Later.
Cease fire with the bullshit.
How do you know all this?
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
Who?
Don't follow me.
This is a dead end.  You took us into a dead end!
The freeway.
Well, I'll think it over.
All of us?
Is he coming?
In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make you a knight. Rise, Sir...
I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training.
Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.
My domain is here, inside this metal skin. And I would pledge to you all that I still own: muscle, bone, blood and the heart that pumps it.
Lancelot, how did you fare in the North?
My salvation is to die a Knight of the Round Table.
He can be no other.
I want to thank you.
Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy.
I should have left you to fend for yourself.
So you were stealing their honey. They should have killed you.
Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
I cannot offer you the land, only my love...
It didn't hurt too much, did it?
Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen.
Who does it serve?
I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
Why?
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
The law forbids it.
The King without his sword, the land without a king...
Very well. Climb up.
It is.
Merlin, the powers of Summoning, the true Name of the charms of Doing and Undoing. Show me!
Behold the sword of power, Excalibur. Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to Thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow.  Speak the words.
The oath. You didn't say--
Well why are they tearing the building down?
How about Lankaster Merrin.
It's-
I'm sorry.
Didn't who tell me?
What did the doctor say?
This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?
Where do you want this?
There is nothing.
A disorder of the nerves. At least we think it is. We don't know yet exactly how it works, but it's often seen in earl adolescence. She shows all the symptoms: the hyperactivity; the temper; her performance in math.
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.
She used those words?
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
Pretty close?
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
You wouldn't.
And how do you go about getting an exorcism?
I didn't get you?
Oh yeah, since when?
That's all the more reason to forget about exorcism.
No, you don't understand. Your daughter-
Thanks. Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good.
She...killed Burke Dennings.
You know how?
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
Oh Regan I love your daddy. I'll always love your daddy. Burke just comes around here a lot because he's lonely, don't got nothin' to do.
There haven't been more than a hundred authenticated cases of so- called split personality, Mrs. MacNeil. Now I know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry, but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first.
A pneumoencephelogram, I would think, pin down that lesion. It will involve another spinal.
Where'd you get the money for the Chivas Regal? The poor box?
Do you like films?
Withering Heights.
Another one. Had your lunch?
Hello Regan. I'm a friend of your mother, I'd like to help you.
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
Did you do that?
Do it again.
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation.
And let my cry come unto thee.
...and to redeem through your son. Who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the holy spirit, God forever and ever.
Father Karras? Father Karras? Damien? The reponse please Damien!
...and the power to confront this cruel demon.
You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?
I know. I read it. These desecration's in the churchyou think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
And Dennings, you read how he died?
It's possible. Possible however
Who?
Are you comfortable Regan?
Give me the keys.
Now?  Why not tomorrow?  After the show.
I've got the grands for two nights, Charlie.  You can't just --
Maybe next time.
Honey ...
Honey ...
Beasley.
They gotta go.
Five's my guess.  Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there.  Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
What do you say we go for a walk, pal.
Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about.
Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma, John Kennedy went by Jack.
Oh my God ...
Oh no!
Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.
Jack.
Jack.
You're their uncle.
It was an accident.
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
You know, I think it's been five years since I saw you eat anything. That's the God's truth.
Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?
You gotta go.
What're you talking about?
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
It's more like 40-60, wouldn't you say?
Where the hell is she?
You hit me.
I just wish she'd get here, that's all.
No.
Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.
You all right?
Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.
So you're gonna leave it on. Every night.  For a week.
Thank you, thank you.  You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also.  So, if during-the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. Stop.  Say hello.  Introduce yourself.  Because here, there are no strangers, only friends. And family.  Right, Jack?
What?
What's the matter with you?
Really.
They stopped serving two hours ago.
Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.  Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?
What're you doing down here?
What're you doing?
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  Jack?
What channels it on?
Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?
We're on after Meadowlark.  What's wrong?
What?
Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.
Stay off it.
Jack!
Go ahead.
How're your hands?
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?
You should've told us you were coming, Ma. We would've come and got you.
And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's opposed to my career.
Uh... he knows it.
This where the auditions are?
This is show business?
I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.
I sing now?
What's the problem?
What I mean is --
Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.  Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.
We'll talk about it later.  Right now, you gotta get changed.
Come on.
Nine.
Shoes?
Maybe it's legit.
Uh, well ... we flipped a coin.
You two could play checkers.
Virgins?
Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
Oh yeah?
Some discussion.
Tom here tells me there's a problem with the pianos.  We were assured they were in tune.
Don't worry about it.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
Save it.  What's he look like?
Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank?
You never sang before?
Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads.  Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
So why's he do it?
I can keep the beat.
You were good.
Soap convention.
By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
Ma didn't want it around.  After.
Yeah... No.
Yeah.
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
Oh?
Older than me.
There were more flowers last year.  Mr. Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's.  Says he can feel it in his elbows. I hope it snows.  I want to make a snowman. You ever make a snowman, Jack?
So. How are you?
Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?
Fine work, Jon.
He's lying.
Hey, bro ...
What do you mean?
I was in a coma, Pollux. I still feel like shit.
I'm late for surgery.
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
Five years ... I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive.
Is someone there?
Who is this?
Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --
Christ, Jon!  How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us?  Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
Jon, this is goddam insane. You can't go through with it.  What about Eve?
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
-- Castor?
You killed them?
What are you going to do!
Jamie ...
We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out.
Screw your boundaries, Janie.  You have something I want.
Clarissa left those here.
What happened?
I can't even look at you without wanting to vomit.
You'll need to recultivate that virus.
What about me?
You'd have to start immediately.
What happened to your big "assignment"?
The hospital.
So -- how long will you be gone this time?
You always say that -- then you leave.
You're wearing your suit --
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
Where's Jamie?
I'll deal with her later.
You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?
Why Jack?
You have kids, Jack?
Take you, for instance...
Jack, are you okay?
Excuse me?
Were almost done here...
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
This is day care.  Its where babies go when their parents are at work.
Where do I go now?
Maybe theres a jewelry store back at the mall. I could get her a pair of earrings or something.
Very nice. What is it?
What are you doing?
Trouble at work?
Damn...
Hey Jack, youre all flush.  I guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you.
Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
Look, maybe Im not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one.  A little flirtations harmless but youre playing with fire here.  The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor.  You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.
Cmon, Evelyn Thompsons got no class.  She doesnt marry Dr. Steve, the womans living in a trailer.
Yes you do...
Oh man, you're serious...  This man thinks I need to be saved!
Sure it's about you.  But it's about society, too.
No?  Cmon, Jack...Ive got everything I need, I dont have regrets, thats just not for me... sound familiar?
Its a glimpse, Jacko.
As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
Whats this, a signal? Will you come whenever I ring it?
You cant do this. You cant keep coming in and out of peoples lives, messing things up...
Ive got kids, Im going home...
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
Mr. Mintz?  I dont think so...buildings closed pal.  Youll have to come back tomorrow.
...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did you know that?
Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
Are you okay?
Jack...dont even start...
You look forward to this party all year.  Whats with you today?
What are you doing?
Jack.  I said the kids are asleep...
Excuse me?
Good, Jack.  Maybe well keep her.
Cmon.
You want the cake!?
Thank you...
Not it...?
Now Im worried...just say it.  Whatever it is well deal with it.
My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and youve seen my pay check.
Good things...
So whats the big surprise? You didnt rent this place for the weekend, did you?
I cant believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didnt want to raise the kids here?
Youre not married, are you?
You cant go!
Its because Im shy, Betty.  So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?
I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
I mean...
I can't take this.
What?  Come on.  She's got a good thing with Victor --
Ben --
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine.  I think if we can rework the power settings...
What the hell you smiling at?  Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Reed? ... Sue?
Hey!  That's a <u>prototype</u>!
What are <u>you</u> doing here?
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
He's not responsive --
Twenty?  From outside the place looks a lot taller.
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
He's right.  These costumes are... missing something.  I can't put my finger on it --
You're hot!
Apparently I can disappear.
Flame on, flame off.  Flame on, flame off --
You're really cramping my style here.
Sweet.
Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"?
Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Sir, I've always wondered... Why <u>Sue</u>? You could have any woman in the world but --
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Just a little banged up.  A couple scrapes.  Why?
What are you doing here?
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
That's good.  That's uh...good.
Which was?
It has to be the cloud.  It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?
And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
I can...make it work.
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
I found a broken gasket, from space --
What's going on?
Victor, your scar --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us <u>worse</u>, maybe even kill us.
Reed's gonna fix me up --
<Cardiac Red Alert> we're stopping the Heart.
They're in the Pulmonary Artery.
What're you getting at?
Benes... What the devil happened?
Wish I knew why.
They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
Trip? Where to?
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.
Just one, General...
Yes, we'd like to get moving.
Bet you're pretty handy around the house... Can you cook?
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this.
Then how come it worked loose?
Shouldn't you answer that?
You must carry spare parts --
Thank you for saving my life.
That's why you're really here. I knew it from the start.
We better get back to the sub. Every second counts now.
Nothing miraculous about it. Just an interchange of gases. The end product of five hundred million years of Evolution.
--and certain chemicals involving proteins --
Removal Point? What're you talking about!
Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
About forty miles an hour.
That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
Tell them to take us out.
Sounds like heavy artillery...
Yes -- with all that pressure, and suction within --
Grant -- wait a minute -- you're not going to dismantle the wireless?
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
They're tracking us Topside. Once they see where we're going, I'm sure they'll take every precaution.
I'm in charge of this mission! You were instructed to take orders from me, not give them!
I don't believe that.
May I?
If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?
'Prepare for Miniaturization'...
Come on -- it's no use!
Even so, because of our size -- I mean lack of it -- we'll still be cruising mighty fast. We'll be smashed to bits if there's any turbulence --
It's a dangerous procedure. If I miss the timing, we could explode the tanks... But I'm willing to try it.
We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
Doctor -- the channel's getting awful narrow.
The Wall's transparent...
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you?
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
You'll take care of it. Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know.
She started shrieking, you know.
What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?
That's right. And we need more money.
You're sittin' here, you're talkin' in circles! You're talkin' like we didn't go over this already!
They can really take over, that's for sure.
Oh, don't be silly.
So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.
Just a general way.
Hiya, Norm. How ya doin', Margie? How's the fricassee?
Well, the little guy, he was kinda funny-looking.
And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
What's the next step here, Jerry?
You wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
...Yah, okay...
It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any.  These men, they just want money, see.
...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
Hon? Got the growshries.
Well, but see, I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy -
Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then.
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
Yah!
Yah, pretty good.
Yah, you said you'd have a think about it. I understand it's a lot of money -
lot. It's a limited -
How ya doin', Wade?
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
Yah.
Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty -
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
... Stan, I'm thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million.
Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh -
Well, that's okay, I just -
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
Yah - how are you doon?
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
Oh, yah, a long time ago.
...I was married to Linda Cooksey -
Better times.
Well, I always liked you, Mike.
Yep.
Linda Cooksey?
Oh. Oh, my.
Oh. Geez.
Gustafson's accountant.
But we still haven't found Gustafson.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
...Chief Gunderson?
Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?
Thanks, hon. Time to shove off.
...How's the paintin' goin'?
Your mallard?
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.
Uh-huh.
And his wife?
I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin' to Jerry's viewpoint here.
I'm tellin' ya.
This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.  The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob.
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.
No.  I found something new.
And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...
I must've left the original in the copy machine.
No, you can't die of insomnia.
Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
Why are you doing this?
I... I don't know.  I guess... when people think you're dying, they really listen, instead...
It becomes an addiction.
I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
I'll take the parasites.
So far, you have four and I only have two!
So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day?  I want ascending bowel cancer.
Where have you been the last few weeks?
I'm just on my way out...
Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
This could go on for hours.
I don't know ...
Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
What is this?  Who did this?
Why would you get bent if I asked?
What kind of stupid question is that?!
Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
You have to get out of here.  Leave as soon as possible.  Go to any rural town, away from any major city...
There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore.  I just can't.  This is killing me...
Hello?
Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the plane.  We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.
How have you been?
We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction.  The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin.  In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble.  I know this because Tyler knows this.
You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
What do you do, Tyler?
What?
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
Insurance'll cover it.
What list?
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
We've crossed the threshold.  You want to call it off?
Oh, yeah.  I didn't know my dad.  Well, I knew him, till I was six.  He went and married another woman, had more kids. Every six years or so he'd do it again -- new city, new family.
The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in.
She is a wild, twisted bitch.  Stay away from that one.
Promise?
Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
... Marla ... ?
No thanks, I quit.
What... ?
I asked you what you studied.
Hey.
Why wasn't I involved from the beginning?  You and I started fight club together.
I don't know!  Nothing!
People think that you're me, because you and I happen to share the same body.
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
No!  This isn't true.  We... we were around other people, together, both of us...
She's... you... you're fucking her.
...go through with this? What are you going to do?
...to let this happen!
One minute.
Please...
Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy?
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
Excuse me?
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
Really?
Ain't that something?
Stuff.  That means you have to get more schooling.
Kimberly Burroughs, eh?  What do you want?
It's not just about me.  Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident.  What if the others are in danger, too?
The second one just dies.  A 16 year old kid.
Six duds in a row.
What do you want me to do?
I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.
Look, you weren't there.  It was weird.  She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident, she knew.  Never mind.
Damn, they always stick me with the clunker.
May we come in?
We had a fight.  Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me.  Wouldn't say where she was going.
Take a guess.
Tell me again how it started.
Shit, I don't have her number.  She was never interviewed.  She took off right after the accident.
But it's over.  Isabella's baby was the key.  You saw her die and everything, right?
You can't cheat destiny.  I know what I have to do to save us.  I have to die.
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
4:25.
Carter, get out!
Police are coming.
Hope you don't think, Browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that I owe you anything.
Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?
Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder.
Fag.
You guys are real... aren't you?
I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did.  They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week.  Got a smoke?
Hell.  This is just like fucking Star Wars, man!
Again.
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ.
That's what I'm here for.
Yeah.  Why not?
Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.  Let's saddle up.
And a beat-to-shit AK?  Every twelve-year-old in Nam's got one of those.
I've seen worse places.
This place is a trip.
Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
These guys look like they'd sell their mothers.
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
You never been in one of those things.
Brewer!  You know what that thing's packing?
You really got a Masters Degree?
Where's Nguyen now?  What city?
Are you okay?
Go United States.  See Nguyen. Maybe teach economics.  Buy Cadillac.  Watch "Dynasty."
Yes you can.
Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says "May have heat.  Don't be late.  All our love."
I don't work with spooks.  Not after that op in Cambodia.
Where?
All this is for us?
He's giving them a run for their money.  Says here they've got two Hueys from Danang.  I didn't know those dinks had Hueys.
How long before you're fully on line?
I know...
So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?
Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
I hear you're not enjoying it here.
Hardcore outfit.  The best I ever trained.
This will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if... you like at a membership discount.
...So he says to me, "you'll never find another man like me"...I said, "please, men like you have one hand on their dicks and the other hand on their mother's leg... I said, there's the door - take a trip.
Fine.
What?
Well, it's funny!  Whatta want from me?
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
I tell you something, Anne.  I really feel like I'm cursed.
Ugh, these tapes are a mess.  I don't know where to begin...
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
Well!  What do you want me to do - applaud?
I think.. I...I realized...I love you.
Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?
No, Jack, no, it's not... She likes me.
You a friend of Parry's?
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
How un-sixties of you.
You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
Free?
You know, Anne does other people too. Sort of a sideline... 
I need a drink.
The Holy Grail?  Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?
I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man.  I really appreciate what you did for me.  It was a very brave and noble thing...
Well, I think you should be realistic. Ya can't start an ad agency on fifty dollars!
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
I don't need a job. I have a quest.
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
Are there any questions?
I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
You can't leave me tied up out here alone, you fucking faggot!
Tell me more. I want to know everything.
Well, it's enough for me.
Excuse me...
So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea.
... It's not just from tonight.  I've known you for a long time.  I see you come out of work every day.  I walk with you to lunch.  I know what you order... I see you buy Baby Ruths before going back in...  I know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore...  ... I know you hate your job and you don't have many friends and you sometimes feel like you're not as... as wonderful as everybody else and you're a little uncoordinated  ... and feeling like you're the only one who's as separate and... alone as you are... and I love you.   I love you.  I think you're the greatest thing since... spice racks and I would be knocked out several times if I even got just a first kiss.  But I'll be back in the morning.  And I won't be distant.  And I will call if you let me... But I still don't drink coffee.
Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.
We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.
Give 'em the horn, Bob.
You're not going to play it again.
Just one minute, you! Don't you ever talk to me like that!
Are you depressed about your daddy, honey?
So how long am I supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?
Rayette.
Just finish eating.
It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.
Bobby...
Come on.
You don't have to tell everybody about it. Pretty soon they'll all go there and it won't be so clean.
Hey, mack!
No substitutions.
I just can't look at you.
Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
It's not that bad.
Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...
Do you want some gingerbread?
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.
I think he's got a terrific personality.
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
You were going without saying goodbye?
What have you been doing since then?
Hello...
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
One thing that's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just walk away from it, without a second thought...
You don't call that music, though.
Wait...
Robert?
No, I want to talk to you now. I have to explain something about...
Four or five years.
I hope you feel at home, Robert.  I'm really glad you're here.
I'm not aware of it. Like what?
Oh, for chrissakes...
I've got an extra jacket behind the seat, if you want to put it on.
No, you're not. Go ahead and take your time.
Oh no, it's been much more than that.
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
And what about love?
Well...
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
If you want to call it that.
I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.
Not now, I'm busy
God, you drive me crazy. I just want you to know how I feel and you don't understand.
Do you have a name?
Yo.
So watcha doin'?
Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos?
Come down!
Who gives!
Wussup?
Why?
Fa what?
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
Yo, remember from the pool, that girl?
Yo! What you goin' for
I think he's 18 or 17.
Now salsa, you know how to dance salsa?
What she look like?
My friend told me she lived around here.
Probably.  One of the many.
You wanna do somethin' with me?
Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.
Would you like me to change anything?
I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
What? What are you talking about?
You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?
Your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations you're about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing. Fletch starts to get up, but Cummings plants his foot on Fletch's chest, forces him back down.
Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?
Thanks for coming down to see us.
What the hell are you doing here?
I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
Margaret.
Like when?
My pleasure.
The two surfer boys?
You find the source?
Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.
I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
Good evening.
He doesn't read my stuff well.  'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.'  That was stupid, Alan.
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
My parents were great fans of the former President.
I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.
Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
Isn't that nice. Since when?
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
Lets see, it was before he moved to L.A... four years April.
I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?
Its okay. The cops did it.
They busted me last week.
Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.
We can't talk about it here.
Because we can't.
Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot himself in the game room. That just blew it for me.
You don't look sick, Mr. Stanwyk.
Maybe I'm just on vacation.
Wouldn't they normally be locked?
I have the same problem with my help.
I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy.
That's right.
Yo!
Only if you promise not to return me.
Did you say cops?
My hero.
Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great.
Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.
I bet you do.
Alan's in Utah.
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?
You were in the war?
Are you still in love with Alan?
I was afraid you'd say that.
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
You can't do that.
Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
You want I set up?
Muchas gracias.
I commend him on his choice.
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
I never read the paper.
So let's go! We run the pictures.
I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.
I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me.
Fletch, you want an apology?
You don't know the Underhills?
I said, I ain't got you...
Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.
Jonathan was such a beautiful man. No one knew him like I did... Excuse me.  I can't do this now. I'll call you tomorrow.
I ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a C.D. from me. Ford.  You suck.
Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex.  Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved...
Art Mo-o-o-ney!
Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?
Thanks for the promotion, man.
All your friends call you Jazz.
Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
You're saying you need money.
What did you... Hey, where's your spex?
Hello, Ford...
I came to warn you...
Spunk, come back...
Let's watch some 'M.T.V.'
Zuzu, wake up...
Pretty smooth, huh?
Are you okay?
Hoh graphic!  I'm going to dream of ears for a year!  Ugh!
So, Zuzu.  Are you okay?
Ouch.
This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.
Holy Colonel Mustard.  Gosh, you didn't mention the big clue... Kid, I can't take your money.
I'm sorry...
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
I tried to help you...!
So, did you find my dad?
You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
Two words.  Disco Express.
It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame.
Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
How's it going?
Jazz, we're talking here.
It doesn't have to be like this?
I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?
When I say 'no,' run for the door.
Shit.
You'd said something about proof...
Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.
I'm still the king!
That's cute.  You're funny.
Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.
Henri c'est gentil d'tre venu.  Je vous prsente mon associ, Pierre Nicoli.  Henri Devereaux.
Twelve o'clock... yes...
Tu sais j'ai rflchi longuement  ton cadeau pour le voyage.  Je l'ai choisi moi-mme.  Tiens.
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.
You're in show business.
All right, get up on that bar and dance.
Get up on the bar and show me how you work.  If I like it you don't have to go in.
I got no music!
There's nobody like that on six.
Where's he from?
What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen?
They'll close you down if they ever get a look at those busted-valise broads you run with.
Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
Christ you should o' collared him right there.
Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit.
Case?  So far I haven't seen a damn thing.
Who stuck up the laundromat?
Never trust a nigger.
Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?
Who is that guy?
The greaser with the blonde.
Monica?  Who's Monica?
Toy wit' this will ya.
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? How good are the warrants?
Where'd you get this fag shit?
I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.
It was a crematorium.
So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.
Yeah.
What are you saying?
No, I don't.
Sexual assault, Daryl.  Five years.  But you got lucky, right?  You got away with something else.  Something you figured nobody knows about.
They around?
Where's the collar, in the cells?
You're shitting me!
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
Oh, yeah.  Damn.  My watch is busted.
Frank.  We gotta go back.  Frank...
You give him his drops?
I'm off.
Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.
What do you mean?
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.
Deleon.
You missed a hell of a game, Frank.
Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief.
Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?
15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
I'm right with you, man.  He's got the heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?
I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it?
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
What'd you say your station...uh, your call letters were?
What the hell...
Oh my god.
It's really you, isn't it?
No, not yet.
You're still my Little Chief, right?
It's hard to explain.  Something happened today.  It was like a dream.  And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times.  Times we never had before.
Dad, I gotta tell you this...cause you should know.  Cause I still remember.
Right here, Chief.  Sorry I lost you last night.  Damn thing keeps cutting out.
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
What?  What is it?
Whatta you mean...
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
What else, John.  It must be different, huh?  Are people living on the moon?
Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?
Yeah, you betcha.
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
Please, Dad, just do it.
It's gonna work, Dad.  We're gonna stop him.
Sull!  What the hell!
My father didn't die in a fire?
This is the Space Cowboy.  I'm an intergalactic traveler from the Federation planet earth.
Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.
Which means he probably knew her.
I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.
Sullivan?
That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!
How do we do it?
Think you can figure it out?
What're you doin'?
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
Maybe we should do some exercise.
I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't.
Come on down!
A hammock?
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
Look what I found.  Remember these?
Shelly!  Where are you?!
What do you mean?
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
Faster!  Eat faster!
Are they following us?
See anything?
I don't see anything.
This is no time to celebrate!
I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.
If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.
That's it.  Pull over.  I'm drivin'.
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
Darren, we better turn around.
Oh, jeez.
I thought Jason was only a legend?
Didn't you say you needed some supplies to do this?
It's all over.
Lake Forest Green?
Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks.
...Good.  So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?
Why not?  I used to play it alone. I love murder games.  Have you ever played The Consulting Detective?
He didn't say anything?
Why didn't you cremate him?!
I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.
I gotta show you Jason's grave.
Don't concern yourself, Martin. This boy needs treatment.  We're taking care of it.  Sorry for the disturbance.
You got me where you want me. There's no reason not...
Mr. Duke, how can you claim that Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?
Eight times.
Well, let's hope not!
Mr. Duke tonight I'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide American Casefile with incontrovertible proof of --
No, I --
Everything going okay?
Hello...
Where the fuck is she, Duke?!
Why did you want her body?
Tell me!
Lock this asshole up.
Jessica, I'm so sorry.  I...I wanted to have this cleaned up before you got here.
She's beautiful.
Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
Are you crazy?!
I'll be back later.  You just be cool, okay.
I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?
Oh, my dear God...
How many times do you want to hear this?
About Jessica.
You call what you did bad?!  You knocked her up and then left her!
What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that...
I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.
I guess not.
What are you going to do?
What's wrong?
All right. But if it mysteriously disappears en route, I'll have you sent back home the minute we dock. Understood?
Where did you get that alcohol?
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
What are you doing??
Everyone split up -- we'll cover more ground that way.
You're making a big mistake, Rennie. It's not too late to put you back on land.
Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.
Everything okay?
Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
So, are you having fun yet?
The Captain and Chief Engineer... they've been...they're dead.
Yes...
I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further...
I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.
I never left the garage without my Windex.
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
Tonight. What's tonight?
You mean because What's-His-Name.
I think we Nought to wait.
You say we go?
The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.
We're making too much of this.
I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
We were thinking of putting in a pool.
Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?
Had to be him.
Great game.
Of course I saw it.
Let's work on it.
This could Pbe it.
They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
What?
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
Opening night?
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
I'm willing to tell you my name.
I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself.
Am I really so deeply repugnant?
Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
There may be things you'd rather not know about.
I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
What happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you?
Life is good.
All the failures, all the fatalism.
A thousand things.
We must have been heroic.
I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
Where's your elastic brace?
It's a complicated subject.
Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.
Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
This is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. Very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see, Matthew. The Red Sox win a World Series. This is deeply, intensely personal. All the mistakes I've made, all the envy, fear and violence that's encased in this little envelope we call a person -- all washed away in the next few minutes. And your grandmother knows why.
This could be it!
Then they lost?
If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.
The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.
What do you mean?
Why?
Sidney remains optimistic.
Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
Yes, Peter.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
And the Father replies?
There was a review.
So does Elliot.
Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
So do I. Over and over.
If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair.
Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
What do you expect when you talk like that?
You really are going to Pakistan, then?  You are a stubborn man.
Just an admirer...
You're a clergyman.
They're calling you "Bapu." I thought it meant father.
Excuse me, baas, but how long have you been in South Africa?
Fortunately such news comes very slowly where I live.
What can we do?
I don't know... I'm still searching for a "response."
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
I'm sure I'm fit for at least five hundred miles.
You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney, but you can't walk down the street with him?
I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?
The fools!  Sorry...
Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such "exception" to.
And that's the basis of this "Declaration of Independence"?
Bapu, for me, and the rest,  if that is what you want, we will accept it. But out there  already there is rioting because Hindus fear you are going to give too much away.
In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan.
Who are you trying to convince?
Vincent, where's the shore?  We're too far out. We have to go back!
Is there any reason you'd want a left-handed child?
Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
How much extra?
So you've finally seen sense and come back to your old job, Vincent.
I guess so.  Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.
And don't go getting everybody lost out there. You'll give us a bad name.  You won't have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
I don't understand why you were dragged out here, Sir.  It's hardly worth wasting your time--a no-nothing case like this.
Even if this Vincent Luca <i>is</i> alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death?
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
Don't underestimate these imposters.
From what budget?
We found his spit in the dead director's eye. He's signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night.  What more do you want?
It's not <i>exactly</i> him.
Surely you know what you have.
Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.
Good to see you're feeling better.
Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?
German.
What makes them think that?
Where?
Everybody goes there.
Hello?
How the hell did you get here.
Why have you done this?
You've already specified blue eyes, dark hair and fair skin.  I have taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions - premature baldness, myopia, alcoholism and addictive susceptibility, propensity for violence and obesity--
What will happen to the others?
He has the heart of an ox.  He could run through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run. Actually, he was a big college swimming star.
Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee.
Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about <i>you?</i>  Where were you last night?
Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
I envy you, Jerome.
It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
Of course I think about it every day.
What about the car?
What is it?
Jerome...never shy.  Pisses on command. You've got a beautiful cock.  I ever told you that, Jerome?
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
What's this, Lamar?
The doctor will give you something.
--I've read your profile.  I don't know about the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own.  You can have other children.
You're back with your own people now. Got you some professionals.
Hello, McCoy.
Three... Rudy got ambitious.
What about your wife?
You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.
You want to drive?
Feel good?
How's Estelle?
That doesn't hurt.
Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns.
Promise you won't laugh.
You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
Doc...
They checked in.
Yeah.
If you don't start telling the truth... 
A man helped me open it...
Your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in Huntsville.
We'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room.
What?
We got this far.
I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him.
Okay.
Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.
I don't know, airport I guess.
Are we going to make it?
Whatever happens... we're going all the way.
What now?
No, I'm not.
Hope you get to where you're going.
Suit yourself.
I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to Gollies. Okay. Any questions?
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
Then you do it.
Which way?
Sure am.
Something ought to loosen him up ... how comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy?
I've got to stop.
Do you want to be dead, Albert?
You knew what I'd do.
Well, he drove it into the river.
I made a mistake.
Bloody well tell me who sent you.
Confidential, like.
Train goes at four minutes past twelve. You've just got time.
I want to talk to you later.
How were things between you and Frank?
Once a week you like a gentleman?
I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?
It is. Honestly.
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
Who's setting you up in this place?
You sure about that?
How's school?
That must be interesting.
You coming to South America?
Where's that?
Said he'd heard you were up in town. Wondered if I knew where you was staying. Wanted to look you up. Old time's sake.
Thorpey. They were waiting for us in the car park.
Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.
Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight.  Nice surprise, isn't it?
Will this do?
Ta.
Is he staying the night?
You don't look it.
What'll they do to him?
What about Keith?
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
Do you want breakfast?
Are you tired?
Do us a favour?
Meaning what?
Oh, you've been watching television.
They're still the same. Piss holes in the snow.
Eh? Have a drink.
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
Gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself.
Put it away, Jack. You know you won't use it.
Gerald wants to see him first.
Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
You had to, yeah.  Why?
They did.
We're stuck with this...
And it's not right to the customers.
Yes.
The nurses?
You hear a lot of things...He's doing very well.  He's doing very well.
That's what I'm saying.  Why?  The leads.  He's got the good leads... what are we, we're sitting in the shit here.  Why?  We have to go to them to get them.  Huh.  Ninety percent our sale, we're paying to the office for the leads.
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
You...
Should do something to them.
How?  Do something to hurt them. Where they live.
Someone should rob the office.
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
No.
You didn't?
However they are, that's the deal. A buck a throw.  Five thousand dollars.  Split it half and half.
A job with Graff.
Listen to this.  I have an alibi, I'm going to the Como Inn, why? Why?  The place gets robbed, they're going to come looking for me.  Why?  Because I probably did it.  Are you going to turn me in?  George?  Are you going to turn me in?
Me?
You need money?  Is that the...
What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
Fine.
Then, you know, they wouldn't be so ups...
Yes.
You think they're going to catch... where are you going?
He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.
Yeah.
Where were you?
Yes.
Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?
You have nothing to hide.
Yeah.  You know who doesn't?
Did the leads come in yet?
That's great.
What?
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
Mmm.
Roma!  I'm talking to you...
The people downtown said...
Shelly...
Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
...no...
...I only...
...it isn't you...?  Who is it? Who is this I'm talking to?  I need the leads...
Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get on the board the thirtieth, they're going to can my ass.  I need the leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm gone, and you're going to miss me, John, I swear to you.
Money.  A fortune.  Money lying on the ground.  Murray?  When was the last time he went out on a sit? Sales contest?  It's laughable. It's cold out there now, John. It's tight.  Money is tight.  This ain't sixty-five.  It ain't.  It just ain't.  See?  See?  Now, I'm a good man--but I need a...
Why?
Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?
I will close.
I will close.  John, John, ten percent.  I can get hot.  You know that...
Now?  Now?
I wish I could.
Can't do it.
No.
Yes.  I hear you.
I sold them to Jerry Graff.
Do I have to tell you?  Moss.
Don't.
Why?
Give me some leads.  I'm going out... I'm getting out of...
Hey, they're fuckin' garbage any case...This whole goddamn...
When?
They took the leads?
Fuck you, Dave...
How was it...?
Fuck her...
Glad to meet you.
"Home Cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,
What?
Yeah.
I've got to talk to you.
It's funny, you know, you get a picture of the Corporation-Type Company Man, all business...this man, no.  We'll go out to his home sometime.  Let's see.  Tomorrow.  No.  Tomorrow, I'm in L.A....Monday...I'll take you to lunch, where would you like to go?
My wife said I have to cancel the deal.
I don't understand.
What was yesterday?
And when was that check cashed?
Today.  Today.  Which, in any case, it was not, as there were a couple of points on the agreement I wanted to go over with you in any case.
No, Jim.
Guess what the Machine did?
You hear what I said?
I don't "want" it, if you catch my drift.
...Mr. Williamson...
Are you alright?
What position did you occupy?
Your friend lives in a fine building.
What took so long?
Vitone!  Our driver has drunk too much wine.
The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Francis... was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.
Honey!  Wait a minute; let's go for a drive.
Deanna, will you get back into the house!
Don Francesco.  You murdered my husband, because he would not bend. And his oldest son Paolo, because he swore revenge.  But Vitone is only nine, and dumb-witted.  He never speaks.
Ten to one shot, you said.  Ten to one shot in my favor, and I lose.
Ready, Frankie.
Hiya, Freddie Corleone.
No.  I mean, are you sure?
Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.
The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.
What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.
The 'patrone' is here.
Where's my wife?
Just now when Johnny Ola showed up, he asked me to leave them alone. Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian contact.  I was on the inside of ten, twenty meetings with him.  But today Mike asked me to leave, like an outsider.
Why didn't someone tell me!
Rocco!
Me too, Tom?
If you need anything, just...
Mikey, I hoped...
Does she blame it on me?  The baby?
Good.  Then you're staying.
It might show.
We've never sent this much with one courier.
What's up?
The High Court of Israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned Jew.' His passport's been invalidated except for return to the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday, offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship.  They turned him down.
I think I prefer to see my client privately.
Everything is going to be okay, Frankie, don't worry.
Yeah, but don't worry.
Yeah.  He wouldn't even go out to dinner.  Just wanted to go home.
No strings.
A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?
Yes.
How's the baby?
Does it feel like a boy?
Why too late?
We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you.  I will make changes; I can.  I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.
Are you Klingman?
No, I meant lose his family.
I like sporting events -- I really enjoy watching them in the afternoon. One of the things I love about this country.  I loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series of 1919...I heard you had some trouble.
I know it wasn't me...so that leaves you.
I just left our friend in Miami.
The hotel's registered owners are one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney Barclay, both Beverly Hills attorneys.  In reality it's split between the Old Lakeville Road Group from Cleveland, and our friend in Miami.  He takes care of others outside the country, you know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman runs the store, and does all right, but I've been instructed to tell you, that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along with you.
This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny this?
Says who?
Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family.
I want you to settle on their terms.
I know.
This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here.  I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you.  My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things.  Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.  Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  It will get back to Hyman Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can trust me.
My lawyer, Tom Hagen.  He arranged this all through your man Turnbull.
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll order something.  Joe.  Get me some bracciole or something. And pay cash.  And in return for these concessions, what do you do for me?
Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...?
You want a war?
What's this?
I have already rented the apartment to another family.
It's different.  He's a man.  And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.
It still hurt.  A lot.
No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened.  It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.
The look on your face!  You're not marriage material.  You're not even boyfriend material.  You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid.
I like my life.  I'm a free man.
So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.
Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something make you think I'm not?
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then.
No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room.
How long you worked for Mr. Whale?
You ever been married, Hanna?
You're sure of that?
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
You must leave.  You were not here this morning.
The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.
My name is Whale.  This is my house.
And your name is --?
When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.  Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself.
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
You went to university?
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
Is this David's doing?
No.
Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?
It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
Sorry.  Not today.
I don't mean to be a prick, but that's how I feel.
Tell me more about yourself, Mr. Boone.  You have a steady companion?
Ah.  A philosopher.
You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  I'd done "Show Boat." Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  "The Road Back."  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece.
But I chose freedom.  David was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue.  I didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely "the friend."  The dirty little secret of a nervous producer.
Isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy?  Do you have to rub my nose in it?
Everybody has stories to tell.
What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
This was World War I?
You're very clever, Mr. Boone.  You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking.  What a crazy old poof.  Why are you here?  What do you want from me?
What did I tell you?  Listen.
Is that really her?
It's not like her.
Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.
Do you mind?
I said it must be weird seeing your monsters again, and you said, "The only monsters are here."  I was wondering which here you meant.
All right.  Let's take it off now.
Look, if you want to die do it yourself!
This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times.
Hey, Boone.
Sick stuff.  Necrophilia.  I wonder if they knew how sick they were.
Where's Betty?
Then take the pills.
But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.
You're a lucky man, Mr. Whale. Whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.
The central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations.  Whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short-circuited this mechanism. Parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random.
I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago. She said you'd been under the weather.
I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a few minutes.
Mr. Kay, sir.
Which ones?  I bring them all.
How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today?
Who was that at the door?
Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna?
That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short.
So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?
Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?
Then the rumors are true?
Too warm for a sweater, anyway.
You didn't?
It's been a long time, Memphis --
He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad...
Fish.
Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."
You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce
Yeah -- ?
Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?
It's about my brother ... Kip...
Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.
Sound it out for me.
I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...
This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?
I hope it's not your dear sweet mother...
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ...
Not my girl anymore
What for?
Yeah.
What's the matter?
You guys have any skills at all?
Walked like a bastard... Skippin' stones and shit..
That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving
Okay, okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.?
And just in case you lose your keys, good sir, I can toss in a complimentary slim-jim, free of charge ...
okay, sir. Let me just get the-order. Yes. We'll be doing some work out your way. We've got a power leak. And it's unsafe. We're moving residences to the... Marriott Long Beach ... Just for the night ...
Okay, then ... I just go to the Marriott and I'm set ...
Whatcha got left ... ?
It looks just like a regular Mustang --
Jesus, Kip ... I'm shot, man ...
It's good to see ya, man. You changed your look -
Kip -- ?
Hey, you want something to eat ?
So what are you gonna do?
What happened to you?
You just got crushed in a car. You're bleeding all over your self. And you sit there - eating olives and talking basketball, as if, at this very moment, people weren't plotting your demise ...
You can handle it?
You?
You don't think so, huh?
Dad'd be proud --
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
Toby...
Where'd you find this one?
Where you off to -- ?
Now what -- ?
Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.
I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ?
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
Arright ... Enough ... I can't have you bellying up to my heart again, man, f you can't help falling off the stool. But he puts his mouth to her ears ...
I do ... I cut "em...
Where to -- ?
This time it's for real?
Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life returning to bid a final farewell?  And have my angels completely lost their fashion sense -- ?
I heard rumors you were back. About Kip ...
Is he still working here ?
I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
You know what you got here?
What? What happened?
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You grew up.
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
Right in my face. You looked in my face and you lied.
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.
What do you do?
My bag. My bag.
I don't care. Something's going on.
You son of a bitch. She's been here.
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter.
What are you talking about?
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
What happened? You okay?
What about the schools?
We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate?
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.
I didn't agree to three points over the vig.- What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.
Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important.  Call from an outside phone. I mean it.
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
Are you okay? What happened?
He's got your father upset. Good thing he doesn't have to go to work in the morning. Is this what he deserves?
Don't worry about the schools. We'll take care of the schools.
You want a partner?
I've been shit faced for like two weeks.
Yeah, so he's like "Check the front of my truck, I can prove I hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something"--
Stop brushin' me back!
Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
Okay.
What class?
Is that true?
Would you shut the fuck up! I know what you ordered, I was there!
What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
Holy shit.
Did your Uncle get arrested?
It's a good thing no one's Irish here.
What's up guys?
How'd you like that course?
What is it?
Okay. How?
What's that?
Can I ask you a favor, can we do this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I leave work to come here and the fuckin' commute is killin' me--
I can come back.
Thank you.
Yes.
Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?
I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.
I didn't see you at the reunion.
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
I got it.
Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
He married his cousin.
Just...take it easy, Gerry.
--No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--
--And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake--
Oh, that's nice--
About thirty million to one.
What should I do?
What happened?  You got fired, huh?
Yeah, I read your book. "Mike" had the same problems as "Chad" the stockbroker.
What?
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
Why thank you.
Why not?
I teach this shit, I didn't say I knew how to do it.
My wife's dead.
Where were you?
I just slid my ticket across the table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta go see about a girl."
Gerry says the meeting went well.
Oh, I know.
That's what you want?
When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
Have you ever seen Annie Hall?
No I haven't...
No I wasn't...
I want to meet them.
When?
Want me to take a look?
You're rich. What do you have to worry about?
Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you.
Do you play the piano?
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.
Not a lick. I look at a piano and I see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. They saw a piano and they could play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano--
I know. I just do.
"Take-back?" What is that? I don't want a take-back. I want you to come to California with me.
Then what are you afraid of?
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
Is that what you think--
Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid.
Take care.
'F we're workin' for you, it's our business too. An' how do we know--  --you ain't one a the guys that sent these things out?
She'll prob'ly ride like a bull calf-- but she'll ride!
Go on. Get in your tent. You don't know nothin'.
Woman can change better'n a man. Man lives in jerks--baby born, or somebody dies, that's a jerk--gets a farm, or loses one, an' that's a jerk. With a woman it's all one flow, like a stream, little eddies, little waterfalls, but the river it goes right on. Woman looks at it like that.
Well, you said anybody can waltz... How'm *I* doin'?
Lots must a died, too.
Maybe the road's out.
Them wasn't two-for-a-cent candy.
Women?
House 25. Number's on the door.
I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name?
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
Government.
Well, I do declare!  I baptized you, son.
Is it fur?
This used to be mine. I give it to Grampa when I went away.  You reckon they could be dead?
This is Muley Graves.  You remember the preacher, don't you?
I ain't no more a preacher, you know.
They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.
Seems like we wasn't never gonna do nothin' but move. I'm so tar'd.
Fella named Spencer sent us--said they was work pickin' peaches.
Sure do.
You ain't got to get sore.
I didn't mean nothing.
Yeah.
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.
What you mean you ain't goin'? We *got* to go. We got no place to stay.
You know what I al'ays said: "Tom'll come bustin' outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence." Can't keep no Joad in jail!
*Ain't* a-goin'... ain't a-goin'...
Where you going?
Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
I like the tent better.
Ma...  Ma, I--I can't go to the dance. I jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan' it, with Connie not here--an' me this way.
You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!
That!
How about it, Ma?
She shore don't look prosperous. Want to go somewheres else?
Fust thing I'll get is coffee, cause ever'body been wantin' that, an' then some flour an' bakin' powder an' meat. Better not get no side- meat right off. Save that for later. Maybe Sat'dy. Got to get some soap too. An' milk. Rosasharn's got to have some milk.
Looks like you done it.
It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.
What is it?
She's gettin' prettier, Ma.
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.
Tommy?
Gone--  --over to your Uncle John's. The whole crowd of 'em, two weeks ago. But they can't stay there either, because John's got *his* notice to get off.
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
Listen!  That's them! Them lights! Come on, we got to hide out!
Fact of the matter, Muley, after what them dusters done to the land, the tenant system don't work no more. It don't even break even, much less show a profit. One man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places. You just pay him a wage and take *all* the crop.
How you get all this money?
Just in case. Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it.
But what about this?
But what does *that* prove?
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.
Come on. Ain't nobody gonna say anything.
Please don't.
Can you pick peaches?
You sure you got ever'thing ready?
You do not.
We had pictures put on, that way everybody knows who everybody was!
Bob...
What am I gonna do?
I want to be an actor.
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
Jesus...
Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
I just play my own collection.
Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.
That's it?
That's part of it.
You met people.
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
Say more.
You know where I live?
Like a union?
I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee.
No deal.
Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury.
The more things change, the more they Goddamned well stay the same.
Well?
Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --
He's falling for her. Look at him.
...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
And not show it to me. Ever again.
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
In Detroit. This weekend.
Enough?
They told me you're taking lithium, mom.
Of course you will.
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
Debi's house.
Ten years. What happened!?
He sells BMW's?
So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me.
How's that?
I'm a professional killer.
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
It's, uh... beautiful country. I had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. There are no signs.
I uh... ha, ha... I don't think I ever met a lady quite like yourself and I appreciate all the pains you've gone through to --
Look, I'll talk to Grace and call you later--
That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.
Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.
You lived in Chicago?
I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.
Shit.
The answer's no.
Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket.
Thanks.
Why didn't it work out?
Everything under control?
This is Mr. Booker, Robert.
I won't apologize for this. And I won't hide it. Not for anybody.
Summers are short here, Annie. There isn't much of a fall. Before you know it, the roads are closed... the nights get long.
Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...
I don't know any other way, Annie.
Liz is taking care of him.  The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can --
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.
Honey, come on. Would you like to stay in town for dinner? Maybe see what movie's playing tonight?
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
WHAT?! How can you --  I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.
Why should they?
I'm sorry... about what I said. It's just that -- all those times you and Daddy were trying for another kid, I... I used to pray at night that it would work. And not because of you guys or that I wanted a brother or sister... but... just so I wouldn't have to be...
Who is it?
Let's bring your bags inside.
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.
Yes. We're suing.
Oh, come on! This is such bullshit! The work is getting done, David. Lucky keeps me on top of everything.
I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.
What about Grace?
That bag's almost empty.
I'm sorry.
I should go get some of her things.
Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over...
"... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'...
How was the dinner?
I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...
You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
And you think it's best if I don't come.
Yeah. She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move. But, whenever it's just the two of us, I don't know... Anyway... what's happening with the Delco lawsuit?
So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried.
Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?
Yeah, what?
Nobody's using it. Silly for her to be driving back and forth when she don't know her way around that well...
What choice!!?
How's Peterson's holding up for you?
I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt?
What?
It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks.
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
Maybe we should give him another sedative.
Mixed salad.
Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.
I wouldn't let happen.
Yeah?
Isn't it like, obvious?
Are you afraid of anything?
I can't... not yet...
Sure?
It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done.
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
Do you want to go around by the old road?
You want to go down or stay along the river?
Have you heard from Judith's parents?
Honey, you all right? Did something fall?
Hi. It's a pleasure. I'm very grateful for the way you took in my girls here. I bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere.
Hey, darlin'.
What are you looking at, young man?
Does a horse miss a saddle?
You know, Rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together.
Well, that'll happen.
Cool?
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
Let's keep her.
That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.
What's that?
Oh yeah? What's that?
Shit!
Hold on a second!
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how many but... my head hurts.
Damn!
You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
Yo. Check this out guys, this is insanely great, it's got a 28.8 BPS modem!
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!
What did we learn in school today?
Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.
Loser.  I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you.
I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.  You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.
I found it! I found it!
Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!
Here's your class.
What the hell is going on?
I'm Crash Override.
It's too much machine for you.
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
Name your stakes.
And if I win?
Kate, listen.
This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.
Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it.
What?
How?
There's a new virus in the database.
Colonel who?
Die, dickweeds!
Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh?
Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me. I'm in this computer right? So I'm looking around...
Yo, what's up?
They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know?
Send a Flu-shot.
I'll take you down there.
Can I come over after Jamie's asleep?
Just leave me alone and lets forget it.
No, no, we have to get out of here right now.
Is there another key?
Its metal, god dammit its metal.
Go!
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.
How do we look?
Why not?
Why shouldn't I?
Jamie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I can go out with Brady tomorrow night. Its no big deal.
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
Come on Rachel!
What are you doing out here alone?
Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.
I didn't know you and Brady had anything okay?
You won't look pushy.
Where are you going?
I'll be out on gateway and I doubt I'll be back before the troopers get here.
Something?
How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me.
It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.
Where's that Deputy?
How's it powered?
It's over.
Thank you.
Loomis. Haddonfield.
Sort of.
Sheriff Meeker, we killed him.
It's been totally charted.
Sure.
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
Saving the treats for Bob?
Shit!
You still spooked?
Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it?
Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
Ten minutes.
It's totally insane! We have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game in the afternoon, I get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight. I'll be totally wiped out!
Okay. Later.
Can we watch the monster movies?
I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.
What about the Jack-O-Lantern?
The bogyman!
Are you sure?
Hello.
He was your patient, Doctor. If the precautions weren't sufficient, you should have notified...
...because there are no interesting single men at this party!
Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil.
And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.
Hi.
Yeah.
I know.  It's terrible!
That's disgusting!
Uh...
Well, sometimes, some, uh...
Oh, that was a wonderful show.  I think that's the best show you two ever wrote.
Mm-hm.
I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.
Excuse me, are there any more claims?
And it's just in one ear?
Now, don't get alarmed.  These are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than I can run here.  I mean, it's, it's nothing.
How ya doin', man?
What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.  What's the matter with you?
Hi, Dusty.
Yeah.
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
How about you?
Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee.
No, no.  I-I-I understand completely. No problem.  Y-you're busy.  I-I-I...
No!  No...
Uh, yes!
Fine.  Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met.  It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick.  I mean...you learn so much.  Do you like Caravaggio?
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.
Yes.  This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
Oh, you-you have that one?
Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
Oh!
Elliot!
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
Tch, no!  We were, we were both going in different directions.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
You've been very cold to me tonight.
Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
Lee...
They're fantastic.
It's so late.
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
Why not?
Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?
You matter to me.  Completely.
It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost.
I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is.
So?
I'll either be unconscious or I won't.  If not, I'll deal with it then.  I'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when I'm unconscious.
Hmm?
Elliot lusts after you.
You know, you've been very nervous lately.
I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.
Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
But you, God, you knew that was going to happen sooner or later.  I can't live like this!
Oh, Jesus!
N-n-no, not that.
You don't have a brain tumor.  He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY  No, naturally  they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em.
I don't know.  Cancer, I--
It was on your shirt!
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
No.
So how are you?
I'm okay.
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
What's the matter?  What's the matter with you?  You look pale.  You okay?
Glad you could put in an appearance.
Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
That's really nice!
Mh-hm.
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
What are you talking about?
Hey!
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.
Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
Yeah, can you believe it?
Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
Hey, what's the matter?
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
Can we, can we go?
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
God!
Oh, that's putting it mildly.  We did everything but exchange gunshots.
I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
Oh, I'm fine.
You must be joking.  I've been doing all my own reading since I was forty...you know.
Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that?  H-how did you get over it?  I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine.  Well, you seem fine now.
Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and  that's this.
It's all right.
Hi.  How you doin'?
Thanks.
Oh, my God.  Thank you.
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
Dad...
Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?
Boy...Holly...Holly.
What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna?
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
And?
To <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  What one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...
It wasn't my day.
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
...you...
Yes?
We could skip the Gavotte.
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do."  Aren't you part of them anymore...?  Aren't you part of the FBI? 'No Girl's Allowed,' or <u>what</u>?  Have you transgressed...?
<u>Who</u> are these guys...?
Who would that be.
No, you're wrong about Verger.
Evelda Drumgo.
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
Who, can you think, who would want to harm Dr. Fanelli, did he have any <u>enemies</u>, that...
How was America?
Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.
It's not something he wants to publicize, Ma'am.  It's just something he does.
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
And how would you know that?
No, I think he proffers to spend his happy hours with his playmates.
...here's to child abuse!
..suitcase...locker...
...unmarked hundreds....
Sir:
I don't mind being the token <u>woman</u>, what I'm suggesting, send me out there with a token <u>man</u>... who are these Warriors, our cobbled together Strike Force?  I'm in the room with a fugitive felon...
Yes sir, I saw it. 
Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.
I'm an orphan.
I said how's your baby...?
Of course, Commendatore...
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.
Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard?  Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.
In and out.  Yes.  And Mama... and Mama, is not your real Mama, is she Franklin?
She's not the first foster that you've had.  <u>Is</u> she?
Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
Well, I don't want to starve them too long.  They die.
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
I'd prefer you to say what you feel.
He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
ARE YOU <u>DONE</u>?
...when I... 
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
I don't wanna go out there at <u>all</u>...
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
What was it.  What was it, honey?
...what?
What would you guess, Ardelia?
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
I am on the track of...
Because...?
"Because we don't have any money."
Ask me when we get home.
I want the money.
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
...a <u>liaison</u> position...
...I feel that...
She must be something special After Dark.
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
...<u>barter</u> with her.  To appeal to her, and you feel that...
It is <u>you</u> who have betrayed...
And you've decided to get <u>married</u>.  You've decided a <u>lot</u> of things.  But, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  <u>despair</u>, of <u>failure</u> of... you still have the <u>nightmare</u>, you...
Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.
But.  He was a night <u>watchman</u>.  That's what he was.  N'They brought back, his hat, his <u>badge</u>, an his <u>timeclock</u>.  N'then they took me off.  I <u>saw</u>... I saw.  Clear as day, do you, do they call it a <u>delusion</u>?  His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, bulletholes and all.
Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction.  Several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  I have to ask if you've placed those bids.
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  And because you have large resources.
I'll bet you're glad I waited until the last day to have this conversation.
Okay, okay, just don't everyone talk at once...First of all, little Jason has a learning disability...
Howdy Pouty.
You are to be executed at Dawn anyway.  Might as well commit the crime. Go to her, Wichita...
No, they're not from Wendy.
What are you doing?
You know you just do this for shock value. It's not shocking.
One day they'll find a cure for AIDS. They'll never find one for sex. It's kind of funny, most movies and stories with a bunch of camp counselors has some serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw who systematically butchers everybody one by one.
College was entertaining, Wichita, but after 40 days and 40 nights of this, I really think we're going to get to know each...
...and it hurts too much to keep these feelings inside me any longer...
Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  You can't be helped, Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished, either. But let's find out...
We had fun. I even got along with Talia-- for about three minutes. I don't know why she hates me so much...
Ann Taylor would have paid a lot more, but I wouldn't trade this experience for the world. Sometimes the first time you understand anything is when you have to explain it to someone younger-- You think I'm a big dork don't you?
Do you really not believe in God?
When were you in Niagara Falls?
I was thinking...if we could mesh my way of thinking with your way                            ] of thinking, we could really do some                        ] great counseling. It's all about                            ] the evolution of the species, we                            ] can improve...                                              ]
Fuck off.
Next to "boring," "Sucks" is the most painfully overused word in the current English language. I thought if I could reverse the meaning of "sucks" so it means something positive, I don't know...It would be vaguely revolutionary. It's kind of my social experiment for the summer. "Suck" is historically a nice word-- sno-cones, your mother's...
Ronnie, I'm still a virgin.
Betty, your daydreams are a lot better than my realities, believe me. I'm afraid though it's time to get your butt kicked.
So, are you a cheerleader?
Gee, thanks.
Hey Veronica, how'd that Teenage Prevention T.V. Suicide thing go?
Let me get it clear, Veronica. You want yourself a sweet homeboy for this T.V. show so you can show everybody what a loose, Martin Luther Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is.
Veronica. And Jesse James. Quelle surprise. Hear about Veronica's affection for regurgitation?
Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. If I have to sing "Kumbaya" one more time...
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye Holden says his ideal job'd be making sure some kids don't fall off a cliff. He doesn't realize if you pay too much attention to the kids, you'll back off the cliff yourself.
Don't worry. We'll work something out.
Guess who?
Veronica, you look like hell.
God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?
That was seriously warped, Veronica.
Veronica. What are you doing tonight?
You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of.
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
There are no stupid questions.
You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.
That was my first game of Strip Croquet, you know. I thank you.
O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely.
And your worst enemy.
What are we going to tell the cops? "Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."
She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
Did to.
You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you.
Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!
This knife is filthy.
If you'll excuse me......
Is it sleeping, dude?
Any contestants worth mentioning?
Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about Joey Blow. When that news reporter gets home he'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern.
Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!
The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness.
This story of yours-maybe the school newspaper will print it when it's finished.
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
Hello!
My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!
My name is Gina!
What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
You have to let me go!
And so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to accept Charles's proposal of marriage!
I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
looks startled at the outburst.
What?
How do you know? Did he tell you?
But that's not true! I've got one.
No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...
Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?
Sorry.
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
Allison I think I did some very, very bad things. I mean very bad.
Give me a break. I checked back into the hospital- amongst other things.
Must be nice.
I have my connections
So you're just packing it up just like that?
Now I want you to tell me what you remember happening- in your own words- exactly the way you told Detective Lange. But this time I want you to make one small adjustment.
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.
Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.
Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?
It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you, I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.
What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?
Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!
Hey buddy!
You mean... when the car went off the bridge?
It was an analogy. Your soul is locked up inside you. You need to free it Trevor. You've blocked it from the healing process. That's what we need to do now. Heal your soul. And to do that I you have to give in utterly and without any hesitation or doubt. Do you know what I mean by giving in? It's about trust. Do you trust me implicitly?
Wait... what the hell is this...
Last week...
The bathroom!  For two days?
You should go in.  You're risking your life again...
And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what I mean.  There <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>.  I probably woulda vomited on him.
Listen, John, you better double my attorney's fee.  She's very inexperienced, but she done a great job for me. And give her your autograph.  She thinks you're some kinda holy man.
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
Whaddaya mean they didn't reduce the bail?  If they didn't reduce it, how'dja spring me?
Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.  You are naive.
Nothin'.
He waited for you three hours!
It's never your fault, Bernie! Never ever!  You screwed up my life, now you're gonna screw up Joey's life, but you're never gonna accept responsibility for anyth--
Listen, it's important, Ev, I gotta see him, I got my reasons, very goddamn important...
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?
I snuck in.
Listen, buddy, I'm really enjoying this relationship we got going here. I been missing out on not knowing you better.  Thing is, I got all this business stuff...
Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...
I... I know that, John...
Now you help me up.  Boy, you seem...  taller.  It must be psychological...  now that I know you saved my life...
What're we talking about?  Reach out for what?
That too.
We're piecing together different accounts and...
How'd it go?
We're gonna feature Gale's cast more.  The trick is gonna be keeping the upper hand on this piece. As long as we have Gale and there's no mystery guy, we're the center of the story.  But if he shows up and somebody else gets him first or exclusive...
He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?
Gale shoulda aired that bit first, she's the one who found this clown LaPlante!  She let Channel Eight get a beat on us.
I didn't say I thought we should have saved him..
LaPlante!  That asshole!  I don't... Hey, is that you, from the tee vee? In person?
You test each one thoroughly?
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
And what about work?  Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now?
Yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky.
And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --
Right.
Well, can I make an appointment?
I was driving by -- I saw all the cars.  Are you all right?
I found a cent!
'"... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '
Hey.  Have a nice time -- it's a good school.
It's the middle of the night, sweetie.
You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?
You've done a really great job with the house.  It's great!
Rita, he's only twelve years old,
Why can't you just drive me to my old school every morning?
I could take a cab on the way home.
Neil -- what --
Honey --
I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
You could have a pool to cool off in.
How were we -- were we cool?
He made, you know, a remark.
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
Yeah, I guess it would be good for us to get away for a while.  Maybe Rudolf got the same idea.  Dogs need a change of scene, too, from time to time.
I <u>remember</u> what day you wore that jacket.  It was <u>Monday</u>.  The day you were all day in <u>meetings</u> again?  And had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>?
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
I get to the restaurant and he's not there. I waited for forty- five minutes.  When I called his office, his secretary said they thought I had cancelled.  I had cancelled!  Then I get back to my office and <u>Aranson</u> is waiting for me and he knows <u>everything</u>.
Boy, you really buckle under a little pressure, don't you?
God, your sister's really hot.
Are we gonna buy this house?
Dad, we can't decide unless Rudolf gets to look too!
Promise?
I'd like that.
Lieutenant Bedsoe?
Hey Lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something I think you should look at.
I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
Detective Bedsoe.
I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
I know that weapon.  It belonged to Juan Romeriz.  He's dead?
The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.
You cannot run from your destiny, Conner.
Sing.
Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.
For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again.
What are we doing here?
To ask her to dance.
Well?
I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing.
Why are you doing this?
You guys are from the British museum, right?
Corpses?
I don't have any answers for you.
You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
Good evening.
That makes you uncomfortable?
Be careful, Conner.
What now?
Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.
We're holding the workers down below.
He's fine.  He swears he never left his post for a moment.  He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside.
Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?
How can that be?
I'm glad you've come home, Conner.
Don't cry, wee one.  It's a better place I go to.
What are you doing?
I could have ended it tonight, but I didn't.
Dear, sweet, Rachel.  Men's lifes are measured by the good they do.
This check is for sixteen thousand dollars.  That's a lot of cash to be carrying around.
The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith.  They've got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer and Thomas.
What'd you find out?
Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.
Stay down!  Stay <u>down</u>, goddamnit!
Bullshit!
Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.
We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot!
We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.
That you, Talley?
Give up.
It ain't been a good day, Chief.
He needs a doctor.
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
We can take it with us.
What the fuck is that?
Cops want to be rich like everyone else. All we have to do is share.  And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars.
You got something to say?
Are you out of your mind?
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
Why don't you guys grab some dinner at the Thai place?  I'll meet you there as soon as I can.
No one's coming.
I'm not gonna leave you!
He can't reach us in here.  We're safe.
Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
What do you want?
That's enough.
Louise?
Did you find Jane and Mandy?
He says he has gasoline set to burn the place.
I want to know what in hell you're doing.
What's my name?
That's on the second floor.  Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?
What do you want me to do?
Did you find the disks?
Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass. Do you understand?
Marlon and Al....
I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.
When this phone rings, you answer.  It will be me.  I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want, you get your family.
I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up <u>bad</u>!
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
What happened?
Gregoire, there are no cockroaches in this hotel, do you understand?
Excuse me?
You want to pay me?
Give me it.
Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?
Paul, you know who this is?
Will you protect us.
Paul, this scotch is exceptional.
I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us.
I will see what I can do.
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
I committed no war crimes.
Time is money, George. We need extra beer today.
Here, have a sandwich.
Lets go, Jock.
I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you.
Are you sure this is the river road?
Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
What do you want?
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.
Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
They should go one truck at a time. When the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow.
Let's have dinner first.
Do something.
No.
They do not have your connections.
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
What is it, Paul.
How can we help him.
My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children.
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
I had you transferred to Kigali.
A little longer, Paul?
I have to stay.
The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled.
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire?
Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.
The staff and guests! How many?
Paul, are you there?
For food and clothes, and all that grows, etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you.
No, I don't want you going on the street.
I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
I don't know.
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
Excuse me?
Where is it??
Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.
I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.
So, what? You're saying we're stuck here the rest of our lives?
-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --
What's in there?
Shit, Pritchett!!!
Pritchett!
Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.
Is she...alright?
Why not?
What the hell good is fixing that gonna get us?
Good point.
This is the best we're gonna do.
Price!!
Don't think it's even an issue.
Where did it go?
You okay?
Then what the hell are we doing here?
Could we have a word?
I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
You know how happy I'd be if that was really true, Evelyn? And how positively goddamn delirious if you weren't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time!
-- what...are...you...going...to --
No...
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
-- even if I give you a million as well?
House 2, Guests 0.
-- then I guess then it had to be you. Sorry.
Vannacutt!!
What is it??
I was upstairs!
Well, I don't.
-- listen to me, goddamnit --
Problem where? Looked good to me.
Price!
Please.....anyone....help me?
It doesn't say.  But that's not what interests me.  There's no death certificate for the daughter.  Anywhere.
It looks delicious...
Did you find her?!
It will heal.
The dagger is used to free those possessed if stabbed directly into the heart, according to ancient beliefs -
Oh my God!  She's in there!
Are we going back to California daddy?
I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.
Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.
Well maybe we don't need to remind her of it.  She has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment.
Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.  The videotape...
A friend?
Oh my God where is she!
Aubrey!
It doesn't matter to me.  What do you mean by that?
I'm fine.
You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we?  You don't have any doubts about me, do you?
Do you think I'm a fool?
Maura, what is this!
Maura!
Are you all right?
I think we should do it.
You must be the new tenants.
I hope everything works out for you, and you find happiness in your new home.
This isn't happening...
No.  But I'm a clairvoyant.  I can sometimes talk to unhappy spirits inhabiting a certain place.
Looks like we have some animal hairs in here.  Maybe some kind of a rodent.
There's something in there.
What, you think I'm kidding?  I guarantee it.  An inch more flank.  Boys upstairs get hot.  Bingo, you're an anchor-woman.
C'mon, Joey.  I'm just trying to help you hit a home run here.
Right.  Like last night's doozie.
The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
Something bad.
Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another.  You're stronger than you think.
Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you.
Uh-huh?
Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?
I put some decaf on.  Er ... make yourself comfortable.
Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.
Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it was lying next to him.  And he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
I'll boil some water.
Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
... but it is good.  You know, over to the left, you can ...
Every day.
No.  Sorry.  Not interested.  Not for my customers.  Have you tried ...
Everything sold as is.  No guarantees. No returns.
Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?
It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.
You gonna buy?
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
... Let it define you.  Whatever it is. Most of the roses die behind the bar. This is the first I've given out for nearly a month.
Yes.
I understand.  Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  What else could you do?
A dark star rising.  I was bound to another's system by a soul I once possessed.  A friend relieved me of that inconvenience.  Now I'm free.  Born again of Blood and Desire.
Yeah right.  How'd you get this number?
Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.
Yeah really.  I'm ...
I miss you too.
Yes. 53
Well, forget about it.  Hawk and I are going to Rio.  We're hurt, we're tired, and a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich.  Right, buddy?...
That was beautiful.
The security's actually not that severe.
That's your definition of "Hard?"
So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us "Watering Hole of the Month."  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper.
This isn't funny.  I'm not into this.  I...
"And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo."
Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.
No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem?
"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"
Don't you just hate kids...
Anna, what are you trying to say...
You got it.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the punchline.  I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower.
God, I wish I could say the same thing.  What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians....
tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.
Catholic girls are scary...
This doesn't taste like cappuccino.
I wanna know...
It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead.
Good job, not pretty, but good.
Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.
We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex.
I knew it!  I told you it was a fake.
For those kind of wages, I could have built the factory in America! They're Vietnamese, can't we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts? I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide!  Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk! The Hawkster!  What do you think of the vehicle?
Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.
Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.
You killed a friend.  Why should I help you go for the gold?
But I'm not the type of guy to hold a grudge.
Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.
No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?
We'll call it the Flying Donut!
Snappy.
...Hello?
I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and I'm gonna find out what for. There's a real story, Smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?!
Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
Cigarette?
...A Muncie girl! Talk about the cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy. I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud.
Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
-- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that!
Is that all, Mr. Barnes?
I'm sure I --
Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
Well, she probably had a deadline...
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.
Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.
What a beautiful thought.
Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.
...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?
Your i --
...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me --
You don't know anything! Fact is they haven't bought it! The stock is cheap, Archer! What're they waiting for?
Terrific.
How long've you been down here?
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
...What's your pleasure, buddy?
I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!
...You don't?
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
But, Buzz --
'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you read this, I will have joined the organization upstairs -- an exciting new beginning. I will retain fond memories of the many years you and I -- '
...Yeah, go ahead.
But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
-- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins!
I'm brushing up on my French with the most charming man, Pierre of Fifth Avenue. Do you know him?
...Who let you in?
Not even behind your back?
Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
Ya don't say.
She's good, Bennie.
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
Thank you, Mrs. Rand.  I think you're every bit as nice as Wes says you are.
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl.  What are you driving at?
She can never be cured?
Where were you trained?
Where do you think you're going?
I wish I hadn't heard --
Does she suffer?  Does she know what she is?
It is not beautiful.
You don't seem very disturbed by it.  I've always thought Voodoo was something to be scared of: the drums sounded in the hills and everybody was frightened.
You have helped me.  I want you to know I'm sorry I brought you here. When I thought of a nurse, I thought of someone hard and impersonal.
You think I love Jessica and want her back. It is like you to think that -- clean, decent thinking.
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
That's past -- that's over and done with...
You want that?
I think I do.  I've often talked a little voodoo to get medicine down a patient's throat.
And what happened then, Mrs. Rand?
Two things had happened, Mrs. Rand. One was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever. The other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill, because she had hurt your sons.
Dr. Maxwell is right, Mother.
If I were as sure as you, Mrs. Rand, we wouldn't be here.  I'll tell you quite bluntly: for the peace of the island and possibly for her own safety, we've come to ask you to send Mrs. Holland away to St. Thomas.
Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
Then again, why should she be? I mean with us, with our...
I'm, uh, going to bed.
I... I think I am...
What?
Dinner in ten minutes.
I'm not surprised.
Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.
You've...
Damn it, Ben --
Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.
I'll drive you --
Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --
Grades?
It's like farming. I am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks, and George Clair has obviously, in the mere two years since he joined the firm, he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro, and I assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course. And the guy talks - incessantly -- throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes - on topics that are the supposed domain of my department --
Maybe it's all for the better, you know? Yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn't said anything... has she acted funny to you, I mean, have you noticed anything?
... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and --
What the hell are you kids doing down here?
Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
I was actually trying to see about getting a little advice, you know --
But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each --
Good shit.
Well, I have to say I don't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl. Doesn't seem entirely safe, leaving your car keys around?
Hi mom.
I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.
I suppose. Why?
Elena. Elena Hood, am I right?
My daughter. I haven't been on a bike for years.  When was the last time you rode a bike?
Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
How can you do that man?
Shit. You're not planning --
Awesome sleet and rain.
Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.
No candy for me?
Come on Paulie, share the wealth. You copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.
Frankie opens them with his teeth.
Well, uh, I don't, it's really --
You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?
No one.
Mikey?
Geometry?
Why are you so good at math but not in English?
Where you going?
You get in trouble?
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
Well.  It looks like someone got to his private parts before us.
It feels warm.
I have to get back.
Do it again.
This murder was in the papers, right?
She your only sibling?
I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records.
Duggar called him?
Not really.
Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell.  Her things are in the house.
What about your shoulder?
He would have liked that.
Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through.
She left the party early.  Friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out.
We're sure it's hers?
What are you doing here?
Eight years.
We'll talk when we get back to Seattle.
That's right.
No way.
Looks like the natives are restless.
Will...I...
I don't know what you're fucking talking about.
I was her best friend.
You and Kay were like sisters?
Oh?
She was only seventeen.
I suppose.
What about him?
Couldn't get it up, Walter?
You're not following procedure.
Your lips, they didn't move.
What are we?
Who made us what we are?
Claudia is dear to me. My... daughter.
No, my beloved, my child.
Where is she? Where's Claudia?
You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
More.
I'm not your daughter.
You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
Why yours alone? Tell me how it was done!!!!
You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
Not you my dear.
What plans?
Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.
You see the old woman? That will never happen to you. You'll never grow old. You will never die.
You... fed on me?
You both did it?
He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He deserved to die.
Louis, look at me.
You never talked to me like that - in all these years.
How do I look?
Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink.
I lothe them! I can't stand the sight of them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I've searched for them the world over and I despise them!
You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
You want death? Is it death you want?
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?
You let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. We'll start with him.
Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
You really want to be with them?
You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.
Take him.
Dear God, what have I done?
You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes.
The trick is not to think about it. See that one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. She's perfect for you. Go ahead.
Read her thoughts.
Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons. Here all one needs is a pair of fangs.
What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?
Lestat - finish this -
Unless I make her one of us...
It's only a siren...
See? I knew you were interesting. You mean this literally, I take it?
How did you do that?
What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?
You said the slave had a crucifix...
Lestat escaped the fire!
But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?
Is this what you want? You ask me for this after all I've told you?
What can I do for you?
You're in 201 and 202.
Wait...Did you say off-season?
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
That could break the machine.
He does work hard.
Their stuff in there...  ...and ours in here.
No way.
Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?
It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.
Karla!
Let him go. I believe him.
What do you mean?
Be careful, Julie.
I don't know...
I got in early. I was excited...  Who was that guy?
No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just...
Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it.
Okay, I'll try. But, listen...  If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time.
Checking the locks again?
We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.
You sure?
It was one year ago...
I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?
Come on. We're gonna be okay.
Why are you doing this to me?
...Why?
Oooh, the mainland --
Oh, look. Another day in paradise with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss Psychotic Episode.
You think that's a good place to hide?
Jeez, that's a full carat --
He leave you?
Cool.
They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.
I took it for granted you gentlemen were refugees as are my other guests.
Well 
The ancient Greeks had just as good an explanation -- that the gods sent the plague to punish mortals for harboring Vrykolaka --
The enemy is in retreat. There will be no more fighting here.  I came here to visit the crypts. My wife was buried here. What happened to the bodies?
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
Where's Thea?
Tell me about them, Thea. They have great wings end long teeth --
My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!
You are fortunate in your father.
Cathy - how does it feel to have a father?
Thea -- you're hiding something. Why do you suddenly speak of your father? You told me once you had never seen him -- didn't know him --
Thea, your choice is a very simple one. Either you want to claim him as your father, or you do not.
Your father knew it too. But he was never sure how much was pretense.
No. No. I won't believe it. He's not dead.
Woman, what are you doing here?
I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure - quite sure.
I don't really know where Thea comes from. The ViceConsul at Adrianople brought her to me..
Your daughter is ill.
What is her illness?
You are a happy man Oliver. You have but one world to live in - the world of today. I have two worlds. I have that old dark world of peasant ignorance and superstition in which I was brought up and a new world which the army gave me  a world of mathematics, gun ranges,logistics, tactics, strategy.
I've seen men die drunk - and I've seen men die of the plague.
Until we know, what choice is there? We have to stay.
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
Theodosia --
Thea, what's wrong?
I don't think so, Thea. He has spoken of your mother. I don't believe he knows you are his daughter.
Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.
Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.
Get that ladder up here.
All right, put up your hands. No fast moves. Come on out here, both of you.
What the Sam Hill you yelling for, George?
Know you? Are you kiddin'? I've been looking all over town trying to find you. I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe . . . Hey, your mouth's bleeding; are you sure you're all right?
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
You what? To save me?
I told you  I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.
Oh, tut, tut, tut.
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here?  Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . .
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
You know where he lives?
Where's Mary?
Where? I don't see a thing.
Hey, who's that?
Who is it?
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
Now, you've probably already guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls.
. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
Hey, Violet!  Hey, listen  that's Violet Bick!
Hey, Ernie!
Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff. You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore. Now hurry up.
Look, bud, what's the idea? I live in a shack in Potter's Field and my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid . . . And I ain't never seen you before in my life.
George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?
Daddy!
We just stopped in town to take a look at the new factory, and then we're going to drive on down to Florida.
Oh, now, don't rub it in.
Big  see! I don't want one for one night. I want something for a thousand and one nights, with plenty of room for labels from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand . . . a great big one.
Hmmm . . .
Sure  Sam Wainwright.
Okay  all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh?
That does it! Out you two pixies go, through the door or out the window!
Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you.
Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school?
Well, no younger than I was.
Yes . . . Yes . . . You're right, son.
Mary . . . Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
Hey, George . . .
Where are you going?
Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'?
Some other time, George.
Hello.
Just a minute  just a minute. Now, hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right when you say my father was no business man. I know that. Why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante Building and Loan, I'll never know. But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was . . . Why, in the twenty-five years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself. Isn't that right, Uncle Billy? He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me. But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter. And what's wrong with that? Why . . . Here, you're all businessmen here. Doesn't it make them better citizens? Doesn't it make them better customers? You . . . you said . . . What'd you say just a minute ago? . . . They had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home. Wait! Wait for what? Until their children grow up and leave them? Until they're so old and broken-down that they . . . Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars? Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about . . . they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my father didn't think so. People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. Well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be!
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
I have a big deal coming up that's going to make us all rich. George, you remember that night in Martini's bar when you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans?
With coconuts?
Do I look as funny as you do?
Too young or too old?
Your . . . your caboose, my lady.
Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.
They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.
About what?
When did you get back?
Where'd you get that dress?
No, I don't want to be rude.
Oh . . . yeah, yeah. That's all right.
Have fun.
Hi.
Where're you going?
Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
Put those things in the car and I'll get your tie and studs together.
I guess you forgot something.
Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m.
Why'd they decide to move?
Where're we going?
But the island!
I don't know.
How're we going to do that floating on this garbage...?
Sean!   Catch the rope!
We're hung up here.  Snagged.
Tina!
What is it?  What's there?
Chief?
I know just where to go.
I can't let you take her out.
I'm going out there.
About 10 degrees off your star- board bow, take a heading leeward of Sand Island, and lay her north by northeast....
What else is there to do?
I'm going.
Bartending?  I'm 17.
Don't go out if it's rough or any- thing, huh?  We've had a lot of trouble.
I got something for you to do tomorrow.
Sailing?  Forget it.  You're beached. Grounded.  No more boats.
I passed out, but I'm okay.
Let's see -- you got a minute?
Fantastic lady.  Don't know what I'd do without her.
Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.
It came up during the meeting.
What are you all, blind?  It's a shark.  Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.
The shark that did this.  It was a shark, wasn't it?
Do you?
What makes you think there might be?
This is a mammal, not a fish.
Where the hell were you?
Mrs. Silvera?
Thank you.  I'll tell him.
Oh, hi -- How was dinner?
The goddamn smell is always the same. 
Sean's asleep.
I'll give notice.
Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.
What is it?  What's the matter?
We're alone.
We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
Thank God you guys were all together. I got something for you.  Proof!
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
Did you say Cable Junction?
Can I go swimming?
Hi Dad.
Hang on!
Is that me?
My cousin will be here tomorrow.
Tina Wilcox.
That's what I want -- a gaff rig.
Maybe it's gone.
But first, a little juice....
Mmmmmm.
It comes here from Cable Junction.
We'll be over by the lighthouse.
I'd like to go out to the light- house with you.
You're going out.
Take me.
Yeah.
Wave to my son.
Go on, you're tired.
Go on, Doctor.
It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
Absolutely.  Good idea.
It's Miller time!
Never know down there.  Helps to have a friend, sometimes.
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.
Damn it.  I can't understand!  I gotta go, hon.
You called, Doctor?
How come?
Not enough loving.
Where's the rubber band?
... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?
After what happened to us?
Here.
You amaze me.  I'm more scared than you.
Finally.
Mmmm... you smell good.
Yes.  It's faster.
Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way.  You're not going to walk all the way around?
Calvin wants me to move the White for tomorrow.
Honey, what is it?
Come on.
Yes, you can.
What do you mean, we don't?
That's right.
Michael, you don't have to go down there.
Are you okay?
I told you, something's upset them.
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
I will.
You look like an orange worm.
How's sleeping beauty?
Could be a new dance...  Walking the Shark.
Some miss all their shots.
Sean.  Sean, where are you?
Hi, Mike.
I was seeing this guy off.  He flew in from Dallas.  Wants to marry me.  He's okay, but Texans are so possessive.
'Course they're also so rich.
Sure am.
You were great out there!
Let's go, let's go!
The space shuttle has landed!
What're you doing later?
Reach for the limit I always say.
That's impossible.
Look great, don't I?
Yeah, we'll find something for you.  Shoveling shark shit or something.
Give me a 400-foot magazine;  we may be down there for a while.
Thea....
Daddy, why can't I...?
Make a list.
It doesn't take much to remember what day they come....
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
Close the door.
Where have you been...?
The doctor said she should be all right...She's in shock....
No cooking while you're here...No washing dishes...No cleaning....
Henny Youngman....
That hurt....
I see what you're doing....
We don't want any....
A big one....
I never....
Your father was six then.  Just like you....
I almost forgot....
I'll be in to read you a story.
Sit down, Ma....
Hey, come on, you can't believe that voodoo.  Sharks don't commit murder. They don't pick out a person....
All you all right?
I enjoy his company....
That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....
You and Sean used to make....
You looked just like your father... The first time the shark came to Amity....
You hungry?
It got him....
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
Flies the plane....
It was no accident....
I can't....
What are you doing?
What's wrong?
Couple of more passes and I'll buy my own airplane.. Hell, maybe my own airline....
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
I could take some time off....
I have this overwhelming desire to kiss you, Ellen Brody.
It was theirs anyway.  I 11 buy us all a drink....
Jake tells me you're going to have to fly for the rest of your life to pay off what you lost at the crap table....
I want you to leave her alone.  I don't want you involving her in....
Can't this thing go any faster?
Would you talk to her?  She's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my father's death....
You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man....
You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....
What happened to Clarence and...?
We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away.
I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
And it's always worked?
How long?
Bring her to starboard.
I don't remember.  One day he was just here....
I'm coming...How close is it?
You getting a reading on them?
A Moray eel...A Moray eel....
'A Moray eel....'
Shove it....
Your equipment has crapped out again....
I'll do it, Jake.
Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....
That bad, huh?
I'll take care of it.
No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist."
Mr Blattis, of our local news- paper. You sure it's a suicide?
We give it one more hour. Did the photographer do the dogs?
Not for me ..
Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..
What does that mean?
What time is it?
Someone bet me a dollar ..
Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?
We're going.
Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head.
They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.
I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.
Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear right now. So save yourself saying it.
That's a very stupid question, Ross.
Ease off, John ..
Now?
Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..
Why did he ask if it was frozen?
Have you got a print from the hand?
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
Alright, you got it. And I'll be putting an Observer in with you.
Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.
Did he get you the job?
Don't you know nothing about this guy? He <u>reads</u> the newspapers. Col- lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried ..
Yes, Sir.
John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John?
Have you been here long?
What are you reading?
No.
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
I know what you're like ..
Just your age.
You know? How do you know?
Why can't I stay with you?
The man who killed Amber is a psychopath. He was up at the in- stitute to <u>kill you</u> - he don't wanna kill Rose - he was there to <u>kill you</u> - that's the truth - and I didn't wanna tell it to you - but that's the reason I want you to stay at Margie's - coz I can't protect you here ..
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
He doesn't need my help.
.. we got a body part. We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. O.K. Now you know as much as we do ..
Yeah, I guess I do.
What was she like?
What does that mean?
You think you're the only guy ever worked a homicide? I was a big-city cop too. And I bust- ed the clock on fucken Jennifer. I know more about this man than you'll over know - and that's how I know it ain't him - you- 're investigating a soap-opera ..
Shut up, King Jay ..
Where do you fit in, Trimble?
The coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?
Who told you?
"Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
This can't be happening to me.
Tell you what -- I'd prefer loyalty..
Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.
You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry? There is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party.
... this is... uh... too funny...
Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.
Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
-- especially one like this.
I'm working with you because of that memo...
Good.  Good.  Glad is good.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
Sure you're okay to drive this?
And I really don't know your noises yet.
I don't know --
Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
I don't like to give up.
There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.
What about medical?
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
Denver is where he should be.
Apparently, Denver wanted to deal with him instead of you.
Now.  Wait.  You didn't actually sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me you didn't sign.  Because I'm still sort of moved by your "my word is stronger'n oak" thing --
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
Good.  I was just testing ya.  But just you saying that? Makes me love ya.
Rod --
See this jacket I'm wearing?  You like it?  I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on "do not do this" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!
Man, I got a shelf life of ten years, tops!  My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time. I'm out of this sport in five years.  What's my family gonna live on? What you get me.  So I don't want to hear about ya shit, your "nya nya nya."
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
I got there from "coin," dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan.
I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.
Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career?
Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by a single mother.
The kid is amazing.
Why not --
I think so.
Thanks for coming.
I have to ask.
I'll go back to them.
You wanted smaller.
SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be?  You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone.  You'd be my only client on that team...
And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?
What's going on, Jerry?
...once-in-a-lifetime.
You look good.
Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory.
What?
That's him. Thats Eric!
Eric! Are you here?
It's not safe.
Well what?
My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.
We should try fishing again.
You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.
I dont know.
I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.
We could co-write a paper.
Hmm?
He used to know me.
We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
Eric, your parents are both here.
They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.
You're Alan Grant, aren't you?  I read both of your books.
The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.
Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.
Bonitas.
We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.
Well that's good.
Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a God Damn thing.
Sorry.  We were saying?
What?
No, no, no, no, no, no . . .
Are you looking for a problem?
That was a pair bond!  A family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound!
And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible.
Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
Are you all right?!  Anything broken?
Do you think the rex might have the infant with it?
She's gutty.
Lava?
Come on!
You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I went up there to live."
No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact.
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
Hold it down, Nick!
Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
Fences are failing, all over the park!  A few minor systems, he said!
That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
Paleo-DNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!
Sure.  I've got a gas powered jeep.  I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.
There you are.  Out you come.
The what?
So what are you thinking?
Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?
Do you see anything?
Alan?!
Oh my God.  Aw, God.
No. We can't.
Dino droppings?
Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
Hammond hates inspections.  They slow everything down.
If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off.  I already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy.  They want Alan Grant.
Tim.
I threw up.
Straight-A brainiac!
Come on, try some.  Take a bite.
It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it?
Go, go, go, jump!
So you two dig up dinosaurs?
You're married?
What'd I touch?!
Where does he think he's going?
Keep absolutely still - - it's vision's based on movement!
Well, it's - - right up your alley.  Look, why don't you both  come on down for the weekend.  Love to have the opinion of a paleobotoanist as well.  I've got a jet standing by at Choteau. 
- - and you're going to sit there and try to tell me it can push blood up a thirty-foot neck without a four-chambered heart and get around like that?!  Like that!?  This is like a knockout punch for warm-bloodedness.
Tim!  Lex!
What's that?
It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?
You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
We miss you.
What's going to happen to the goat?  He's going to eat the goat?!
I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -
I'm a hacker!
You tell them if they come up to seventy-five, I'll cut them in on the Crystal Lake package.
Chain saws.
I don't think the people who live around here would like that very much...
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.
Other guy?
Janet, are you okay? Are you there?
Quite a circus.
What?
Who?
Ruby... this guy almost took out an entire Tactical Response Team. You can't expect me to just leave you --
Oh?
The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced...
So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?
I think I'm onto something, Joe.
If I'm right, this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood.  That means that Jason might've been Krueger's first victim.
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
How long will the effect last?
Are you all right?
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
-- Merely in the interests of order.
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide.
That would be even worse -- it would be a compromise.
-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
I was restoring some stones here in the upper section one day -- and I found this.
A true friend would do it.
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
Oh, don't they?  I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.
I usually take lunch by the River.
I did not realize it was obligatory.
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
When I have no reason to doubt.
You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
Your office is the Workmen's --
He was found in the River.  Could he swim?
He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
Maybe it's true then what she said.
... Why take me into your confidence?
-- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency.
I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
May I ask where your two warders are?
"Raban" -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.
Wait a minute.  "Raban?"  Where have I heard that name?
It's gone out so quickly?
I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.
They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.
Oskar!
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.
I thought that with your assistance we could have the premiere at the Albert Hall. We'll take out a full page ad in Variety - "The Lord Darrow Benefit screening". We'll invite the King of England - hell, we'll get the whole Royal Family along! It'd be good for them and good for us!
Father It's somewhere south-west of here - we need to inform the museum ...  organize an expedition -
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
I'm sorry ...
There's a light up ahead.
Give it back!
Ann ... Ann!
Look, I've sailed these waters for twenty-seven years ... there's no island like that around here.
I guess that answers your questions. There's no island on these co- ordinates - not even a lousy fog-bank.
Did you see her?
Holy shit! Look at the size of that!
Not me. Thought I'd head out west ... get into some Redwood country.
Haven't seen her - not since we got back.
Are you nervous Jack?
Are you gonna start it up?
Uh uh.
All right. Loneliness.  Well -- separated. From other people. Forgotten.  Well, as if I can be here, I can go through the motions, right? But the truth is, I don't belong.
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
Miss Daniel, be sensible, you find another place till we get things cleaned up.
Why isn't he locked up?
What was better? I made better bait?
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
Why?
Honest?
Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it.
Company outing or picnic or something like that.
He never told me.
What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
-- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
I've checked the records of Jane McKenna's death -- I can't get anything special. But Frank Ligourin had another girl you said, besides McKenna and you.
I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead.
You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
Please.
I saw Mr. Faber.  You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?
Go down in my room.
You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.
I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?
You must be discouraged.
You were hired to look for Tom.
Have you discussed this with them?
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
That's how the other one died, you know. In the water.
Think this is our guy?
Mr. Kramer?
Where is the child?
What do you have here, Billy?
What do you like best about her?
He hits me on the planet Kriptarium, when I steal the buried treasure from the famous peanut butter factory.
Show.
When is mommy coming back?
What about my orange juice?
Uh, huh...
That's not the right soap.  We use the kind in the green and yellow box.
Salisbury steak.
You don't hate it.  We had Salisbury steak last week and you liked it fine.
I want a pizza.
I think I'm going to throw up.
I want my...mm...ommy...I want mmmy...mommy...
Daddy?
Now go to sleep.  It's very late.
Yes?
Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite...
Billy.   This is Dr. Alvarez. She would like to talk to you.
Objection.
Is that really your chair?
No, son.  Daddy and mommy will never get remarried.
Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
Was there apple juice when you were little?
Was there Burger King?
Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father.  Now there is a man who is very wise.  He's called a judge.  And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with.
Because...Well, that's what he does.  He's a very powerful man.
Sustained.
Did you wish to?
Yes...Look, during the last five years we were married, I had...I was getting more and more...unhappy, more and more frustrated.  I needed to talk to somebody.  I needed to find out if it was me, if I was going crazy or what.  But every time I turned to Ted--my ex-husband, he couldn't handle it.  He became very...I don't know, very threatened.  I mean, when- ever I would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack.  Anyway, we became more and more separate ...more and more isolated from one another.  Finally, I had no other choice, I had to leave. And because of my ex-husband's attitude--his unwillingness to deal with my feelings, I had come to have almost no self- esteem...  At the time I left, I sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me--that my son would be better off without me.  It was only when I got to California and started into therapy I began to realize I wasn't a terrible person.  And that just because I needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother.
Objection.
Objection!
Ted was a good worker.  But, ah... ... after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own, things started to change. Look, I know he had problems, I understand that.  I've got problems, everybody's got problems.  But I've got a shop to run, I can't let that kind of thing get in the way...  I guess I felt that Ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office.
Mis-ter Kramer, it's...  ...almost four now.  It's the Friday before Christmas.  Nobody is going to want to--
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you were married seven years. Is that correct?
In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way.
A heavy drinker?
Did he ever fail to provide for you?
I don't recall.
Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.
How long was that?
Were you?
Here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning.  They'll be ready on Saturday.
How's the new job?
He looks like a terrific kid.
Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.
Ted, listen to me...You and I, we had a really crappy marriage--  Look, don't get so defensive, okay?  It was probably as much my fault as it was yours... Anyway when I left I was really screwed up--
I'm sorry...I just mentioned it in passing.  I never thought he'd use it.
Okay, I'm here.  Now why did you--
Hey, what's the rush?  C'mon, walk me a couple of blocks.
What the hell is this?
And?
Okay, Phyllis, what's up?
So...what's so terrible about that?
And?
What?
Three months.  How can you tell?
I lost him?  I lost him?
Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
Yeah.
You ever think about getting married again?
How many onions does it say to use?
Thel, you ever hear from Joanna?
She ever ask about me?
Goodbye, Kundun.
Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
Dalai Lama.
We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
Have you heard the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement?
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
Ngabo did not have the state seal. He could not sign.
General Chiang Chin-wu, the Chinese representative, is en route to Dromo. He is coming to meet you.
Oh, no. Where will he go?
I will be back in a few days.
Who am I?
Do I have money?
How big is Tibet's army?
Will we be in this war?
The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
Quite simple. Yes. Good.
What is the size of our army, now?
I am scared.
I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.
What do you think?
Things change, Kundun.
I want to go down there.
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
You will not come?
We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.
You have grown up very good.
The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. Our only hope is to fight.
This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost.
What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?
And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?
I'll sue you.
You're a beautiful woman.
It seems like we're getting lower.
I might get a shot.
And what would he do come winter?
We'd only just met.
Jesus Christ!!
Just spit him back out.  Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know?
Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
No!
He never said "go".
Well, you can try talking them into that, if--
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim.
I got something on the screen.
You take care.
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?
Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
And how would we neutralize him?
How big do the bears get?
Why are you here?  Really.
Okay.  We're up at six.
He thinks they're what?
Like little children.  You okay?
<u>Ow</u>.  Shit.
I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
Calm down.
Are we crazy?
It was... something meeting you.
Different worlds, Jack.
Are they feeding?
Hank.  The little cannon you brought, get it.  Guard the shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.
Even if we <u>could</u> tranq him-- how would we get him on land.
If you get a safe shot...
Thanks for your help.
The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?
What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.
With what?
Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
What was that?
Hank!
Did you get him?
I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?
This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
You and Kevin.
You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.
I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
You missed Fourth Amendment law. Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. Where were you all afternoon?
Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin. You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried. It's not your fault it ended this way.
Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient...
I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I can hear. Shut that dog up.  Is there a ladder? Is there a rope?
Lecter carved up nine people - that we're sure of - and cooked his favorite bits. We've tried to study him, of course - but he's much too sophisticated for the standard tests. And my, does he hate us! Thinks I'm his nemesis... Crawford's very clever, isn't he? Using you.
What you're doing, Miss Starling, is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview, and refusing to share information with me. For the third time!
Do you need a police escort, Starling? Or do you think you can find the airport by yourself?
Not to my knowledge. Privacy is a great concern to my customers. But, if you say this is an FBI matter...
Okay, Miss Starling?
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?
Blue square for Belvedere, Ohio, where the Bimmel girl was abducted. Blue triangle where her body was found - down here in Missouri. Same marks for the other four girls, in different colors. This new one, today... washed up here.  Elk River, in West Virginia, about six miles below U.S. 79. Real boonies.
Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.
Okay, Starling. Let's have it.
But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to.
If we act too anxious, he'll make us wait. He'll let the Senator keep hoping, day after day, until Catherine finally washes up. That'd be the most fun of all.
I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell?
With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?
I have no doubt of it.
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
Oh, Officer Starling... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?
I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.
Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he? Apparently he likes you. And you like him, too.
Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just like that gospel program. When you leave, they'll turn the volume way up. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.
"Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center." Sounds charming.
I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view.
He kills w-
No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?
What did you do?
But you could. You did.
I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again...
I'm not having a witch hunt here, Mr. Crawford! Our patients are decent, non-violent people with a real problem.
Your "father"?
You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London...
Mr Poe?
What is it?
And my compliments to you...
Where will we go?
My letter...
Will you consider that?
beyond the periphery of men, staring at him.
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
Fort Edward, then?
I ain't your "scout". And I am in no damn militia.
Where do we go from here?
Then what?
Any powder?
What did you say?
You do what you want with your own scalp.  Do not be tellin' us what to do with ours.
I believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish, their law no longer has rightful authority over us. All they have over us is tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer.  No force on earth will keep me here... Anyone caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each man make your own decision... Those who are goin', be back here in an hour.
Got a reason to stay.
Many men here, their homes are in the path.
That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.
Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to Fort Edward two days ago.
Not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort.
First rank! Second rank! Present arms! 
Advance, Sergeant Major!
Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major!
Three, four oxen... much wampum.
Yes.
I must receive proof more conclusive than Mr. Poe's opinion before I weaken our defenses by allowing militia to withdraw.
Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
I am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity... The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon.
Le mot d'ordre?
Dead?  This morning you said he had some skin disorder.
Was there such a thing?
DeJesus!  A readout!
We're getting out of here just in time.
That's why there's a dead one on the ship.  It ran out of blood.
Huh?  I...uh...uh...
Sixpack?
That was a loud one wasn't it?
Shit!  He sent them all.
It hit me!  Where are they?!
Something wrong, Cobb?
Give me a readout, DeJesus.
How's the weather for pickup tomorrow?
Forty-eight hours!
Personal effects...
Who else...Sixpack.
Yes sir...
Bullshit.
Burritos...Enchiladas...
Look.  Water.
How far away is she?
Excuse me, sir...Bowman's sick.  She's downstairs in the infirmary.
The monster appears to be a genetic aberration...
Don't spend all day down there.
My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey?
The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.
Bitch!  Look what you did!
What's wrong, did you miss me?
Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.
I'll kill him!
So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?
Drachmas, I hope. I would feel safer with a chicken drumstick. They could do more harm than good.
Ed can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz.
Twenty-five from me, Tom, Soap and yourself; a hundred grand to the pound. You don't need to count it.
Because it's cheap like a budgie.
Yes?
What's that?
No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
Next time we do a job like this we gonna want more money, or we are going back to post offices and cars.
I don't know what you mean.
All right, all right, so we can say he is good.
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?
So who's the Guv? Who we doing this for?
The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?
Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.
It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
How long has he been in there, son?
What can I do for you?
Who was that?
We gotta get those guns.
It must be this one.
Right, his leg's going now.
Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?
Well, what do you want us to do about it?
No I fucking don't! You can't make a cup of tea, Edward.
I hope this is the right move.
There's nothing in it!
I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.
Tom, this is our case.
Tom, don't mess around, let's go.
Tom?
I'll see ya.
That you, boy?
Go on.
Yes?
Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.
What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.
And that does include the amp?
Jews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom.
Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?
Look. Go on, look.
My van is half full.
What have you come as?
If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money?
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.
What you telling us for? The only thing I care about is whether you get your rest in.
What's left over?'
This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?
How many feet?
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?
Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school she's like desperately in love with Santo Guerra.
Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
Please.
Because it's a job?
You're dismissed, Private.
If the incident happened the way you say it did, there hasn't been an infraction.
Did you know he was going to be there last night?
And you and Private Graves--
We're not running a dating service here.
Private Johnson!
Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
I'm not picking it up.
You still going to all the home games?
You look good--
350 pounds.
You've been in this house for a while?
Spanish in Florida called him Juan Caballo. John Horse.
Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--
Dad, I talked to the track coach--
Tanks, huh?
Fifteen years in El Paso.
Bird flying south-you think he sees that line? Rattlesnake, javelina-- whatever you got--halfway across that line they don't start thinking different. So why should a man?
Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder.
Mikey look at this--
--but I gotta say I think there's something to this cold climate business. I mean, you go to the beach- what do you do? Drink a few beers, wait for a fish to flop up on the sand. Can't build no civilization that way. You got a hard winter coming, though, you got to plan ahead, and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout.
There's not that much down here, Colonel. Big O's is the only place in the county that our African American soldiers are uhm--that they feel comfortable in.
I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
Eladio Cruz.
Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where are you? I'm lost--]
No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see the bank!]
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
"Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, "What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!"
Every other damn thing in the country is called after Martin Luther King, they can't let our side have one measly park?
They just wanted it to be one of theirs--
Your mother was a saint.
Which is why we need to talk to you about the new jail--just so we're all on the same page.
I got an idea what happened.
You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that?
We're building up tourism, Sam--
Your mother's family is Spanish?
The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
Right. When he was killed.
There must have been somebody.
Thank you.
Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails."
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
I'm not open. We were just talking.
Not if you have half a brain in your head.
She finally got in--
Can I get this?
How come?
Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
You built our patio while you  were on the county?
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
He's all yours.
I thought you got through that pretty well.
Nice-looking kid.
I mean what did we know about anything?
How come it feels the same?
It isn't. Not by a long shot. He holds her and they lie silently for a moment--
I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.
We start from scratch--
Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.
I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.
They don't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy this?
If he hadn't found that Deputy job, I believe Buddy might've gone down the other path, got into some serious trouble. Settled him right down. That and your mother. 'Course he had that other one later.
Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.
You going to tell her?
It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other.
How much?
I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich sees me talking to you.  He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole.
Why?
I could have lost my fucking hands.
That's Butterfield...
Maybe they're not tricks.
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
Right.
You don't have a clue what you're into, do you?
Who did this?
I don't want him getting in the way.
I'll tell you.
Anything?
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you?
Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm.
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight?
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
I can be very persuasive.
How did it go today?
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
Oh Christ.
Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
What then?
Nothing's going to happen to you.
... oh... God...
What about me?
Sure.
What were you doing up there?
And this Butterfield guy--
No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
With what?
Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?
Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
Philip Swann?
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
Don't bother.
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that.
How the fuck do you do that?
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
Oh Jeez.
I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
They got here before us.
This is where we killed him.
What is?
You don't think I've got it to give?
You could still help me do that.
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
Oh, hi, Elaine.
Ok.
You really are having a mid-life crisis.
Charlotte, who?
Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs.
Hans was very attentive to you.
Oh.
But, I'm mean.
No one ever tells you that...
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
It's for my daughter.
Four.
Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.
Well, I guess she's more around your age...  You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.
Well... have a good flight.
Do you like massage?
Oh, come on.
Hello?
Great.
How do you say "hospital" in Japanese?
You wanna come?
I don't know what to do.
Hair stuff?
...doing like twenty million interviews a day... It's soo good to see you. How long are you here for?
Uh..thanks.
Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
Peter, where are you?
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.
What?  That's horrible!
You're glad somebody tried to kill me?
Nonsense, it's all of our home.  So how's work treating you?
Quiet.  Real quiet...
He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.  I am a fan.
So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
I don't mean to belittle you, but we've been through this before.  Satan is not what you think he is.  Satan is not some creature.
Is he going to be okay?
I've had it.  Townsend's dead.  The police are calling and now I see you having a scene in front of the children. I'm sorry, Maya, you've been with us for many years, but effective immediately, I'm rescinding your right to live at the church.
You'll do it?
How're you doing?  Looking lovely as always.
He spoke to you?
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
...the ark sank, the sun set, the ark sank again.
We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
Yes... and you are?
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."
A narcissist doesn't admit it.  It's the extreme of self-denial.
So...what did you think of the tape.
Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?
When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like...  "The time of transformation is near..."
Nothing yet.
Peter, let go of the chair!
Plenty of time.
Good seeing you again.
He can see you Thursday.
Yeah.
Thanks for handling this.
She told me she killed them.
nothing.
Engaged.
Whatever.
There you go.
No I don't.
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
So you're still breast-feeding?
I can take it.
Sorry.
I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me.
So how long is this trip?
I don't know sometimes.
Like you don't give her a hard time.
So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?
I don't know how to walk in heels.
They ever love you back?
Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's time to start thinking about other things besides basketball.
What's up with that?
Thanks, Sidra.
Thanks.
So what are these Spanish guys like?
So...does it hurt?
My Dad plays for the "Clippers."  He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too.  Same number and everything.
Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
See you made it.
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?
Guess not.
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
Kiss my booty.
Hey.
Who was that?
Who's nobody?
Hey.
Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.
Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry.
Never had to.
How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.
You don't think so?
You're what?
When did you decide all this?
Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
Who's this guy I always see her around?
And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
You're serious.
You're out of your mind.
So?
No.
Not great.
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
How was your game?
Still the man.
Where's your dad?
Guess I should have been telling your father.
What people?
Well, tell them to mind their damn business.  You're smart enough to get a degree.
Still is, so let yourself out.
After five years.
What surery?
Hi, hello, great.  This is Seduce and Destroy?
Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.
...what the fuck is this...?
Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
Please put your clothes on, please --
Honey.
Yeah, but I don't know --
Yeah.
No.
You mind if I check things back here?
I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --
Is this boyfriend bothering you?
Just Jim.
Bye, bye, Claudia.
Billingsley's?
So you've done it --
To not do that.  To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
-- no, no, it's fine. Fine.
It's fine.
I lost my gun after I left you today and I'm the laughing stock of a lot of people.  I wanted to tell you that. I wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and I feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie about things and I'll tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I'm not a good cop...and I'm looked down at...and I know that....and I'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me.
Hello.  You're back again, huh?
Where's Richard and Julia?
Can you hold it?
I have to go to the bathroom, Cynthia.
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GET HIS MONEY AND GO -- DID YOU GET HIS MONEY? DID YOU GET IT?  DID YOU GET HIS MONEY, DAD?
C'mon, Dad.  We gotta just GET HIS MONEY AND GO, LET'S GO. Let's get the money --
Tell me what you know, I'll tell you what I know --
Ok. Listen. You: c'mere.
You wanna disrespect an officer of the law?

Just throw some money around. Money, money, money.

You see?
...please...
Give me your keys, Don.
I need to sit down.
Get a girlfriend.
She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.
Time lines, y'know?  I remember things but not so -- right there -- y'know?
Other fuckin' assholes like me.
...cocksucker....
Jack.
I think you have the wrong number.
No.
-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --
This isn't meant --
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
And what did your parents do?
And your father?
Psychology major?
Where does that name come from?
It's not your given name, right?
And "Frank?"
Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
Uh. huh.
I've heard your tapes on the phone.
When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
I AM CALM.
What does it look like?
I preffer to stand.
Been drinkin' today?
--- What was that?
No. No. Stay down, Marcie, sit back down on that couch --
This is the LAPD, if anyone is in the closet I want you to come out and show yourself to me, slowly and with your hands up --
Are you ok?
Rose is on the phone and here's the cards for today --
I'm sorry.
How you doing?
You're my handsome man.
The question isn't wether or not you cheated on me, the question is how many times have you cheated on me?
Was there anyone that I know?
Just once.
It's over.  I talked to her this morning.
I don't.
Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy?
I think that you know.
Hello?
She's asleep.
You're Jimmy Gator, right?
No, I'm just a friend.  What are you doing here, I mean...you know Claudia?
Want me to wake her up?
Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.
Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
I can't.
Shut the fuck up.
No, Linda, you don't understan --
You don't do that, you don't call him, you don't know to get involved in the bussiness of his, of his of <u>my</u> family. this is the <u>family</u>, <u>me</u> and <u>him</u> do you understand?  You understand? NO ONE ELSE. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE.  That man, his son does not exist.  HE IS DEAD.  HE IS DEAD and WHO TOLD YOU TO DO THAT?
Yeah.
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
Bullshit.  Bullshit. You know the answer to every goddamn question and I knew the answer to those questions and I'm not half as smart as you are so What Happened?
You have to be nicer to me, Dad.
..sorry...
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
M'lady...?
No, M'lady.
M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death...
Anne...!  I know... I know that to love you is treason against France. But not to love you... is treason against my heart.
Mother -- ?
It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead!
Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him and the man who told me.
Wh-- Wha--
What do you propose to do?
What are they doing?
You can do it.
But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time, but --
Aramis, this will never --
But --
Bloody hell...
A simple theological discussion.
I cannot betray Louis.  I will defend him with my life.
Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --
I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.
Where are we?
Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!
D'Artagnan, unready?
Do I look all right?
That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!
Michelle cannot possibly accept!
Die?  What...?
I will also speak with the King, for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused.
Athos!  I know life means nothing to you at this moment, but I will not let you kill yourself.
If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen.
He lies.  He is here to trap us.
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?
I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --
The room of the King's favorite mistress?
This place... I once lived in a country house.  I had guardians -- an old man and woman.  And tutors. But no friends.  Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison.
Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
A personal nature?
I was told this impostor was dead!
Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother.
Continue.
What number, on the first page?
You've... memorized...?
Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
Magnificent valor...
Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before --
Ah yes, the riots.  We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?
I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.
... Nothing.
I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven.
Raoul... Oh, Raoul...
We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years.
Our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.
Alright, we know who we're looking for.  Play it cool until the time is right to make a move.  Let's not pull any gangbusters shit or we'll lose him again.
He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
You can cut the shit, asshole--
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
What did the six-toes have to say?
What's this?
Well don't you think that's odd?
It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?
So...  to get the car back, you break into her house.
Are you alright?
I tell you one thing Trudell - you'd make a hell of a cop...
I was just having a little fun -
What?  Wait a minute -
What's going on here?
I had it all on tape...
I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want.  That's where I met him - told him what I had.  The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow.  So I ran...and met you.
What?
You are drunk.  You know, it's been a long time and I'd love to catch up, but I really got to -
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
And?...
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
I've got a better idea...
Donut?
You know this time, there's nobody that's gonna cover your ass. You're over your head this time.
Tubbs, these people mean business.
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.
What would your - boyfriend - think?
You don't seem afraid of much.
What?
No.  The numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. It's a book code.  And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him.
And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?
Is it weird?
Who did he ask for?
Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.
And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.
Get me a plane...
From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.
When are you coming back?
He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors.  I didn't understand the mirrors before.  It's very important.
It's getting late and...
Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock.
Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?
Is that you. D?
My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.
What am I doing here?
According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you?
Do you see?
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
Linda doesn't come in nights.
She'll be in, in the morning...
Do you know something about that?
He's right-handed.
He's very strong physically.
He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.
I don't want to do that,
You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
Hello, hotshot!
Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
Can I have one of your cigarettes?
Then why?
What will you do?
You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin's grandparents. They haven't seen him for a while.  I'll come and get you afterwards...
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
Meet point's up ahead!
Will it keep them out?
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
I figured I'd ask you...
Are you gonna kill him?
How did it happen?
She got all right?
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
Emotional problems, I hear. He was a very promising young officer. Do you ever have any problems, Will?
Of course, you don't.  I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
Do you have the file with you
Do you dream much, Will?
It's not 'interesting'. You thought of it before.
You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you?
I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired it enormously. What a cunning boy you are, Will.
I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us.  Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?
Why does it feel good?
...if he's smart he'll approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear?
Caspiar?  I haven't heard of that.
You show a lot of promise... but... my concern is I don't know where to book you.  You're not a stand-up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself?
Sitcom...?
I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
Andy!
Hi, George!  Good to hear from you!
I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony.
That means it was a success.  I woke up the audience -- like punk rock!  Here, take this.
What was that all about?
So how can I help you...?
I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.
Tony Clifton.
I can't move my arm.
But I've got a sports show. Championship wrestling, at five.
B-but I have them.
B-but... we saw... your neck...
Ten.
Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!
Hi...
Andy, the theater's that way!
And all this will be for real?
Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well I say -- get back in the kitchen!
Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??
Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
You're NOT DYING!
You're not listening to me --
Go to commercial, man!  Get off the stage!
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
Give me the book.
"Philosophically"?
So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
Positive.
"Burlesque"?
Get off my stage!  You're fired!
Can I help you with something?
I'm worried about Andy.  His stress level is affecting his work.
Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
Why is he saying these things?!
JESUS CHRIST!!!!!
We'll need a search running.
They are dead.  In either case --
The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.
I sent two units.  They're bringing her down now.
Weird.
That's the third white van I've seen.
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
Hello, Trinity.
No, it's all right.
You bet your ass.  It keeps him going.  Maybe it keeps all of us going.
Give me your phone.
What is he doing?
Hello?
Who's coming for me?
What the fuck do they want with me?!
No!  It's too far away.
No way, no way, this is crazy.
Ironically, this is not far from the truth.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?
... am I dead?
Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?
When?
This isn't real?
Do you understand, Neo?
No you don't.  Did you see the woman in the red dress?
What did she tell you?
Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea.
How...?!
Yeah.
I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
What the hell is this?!
E.M.P.  An electromagnetic pulse.
Should I be?
Did you go to her?
What did she tell you?
What happened?  What did you see?
Go!
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
No, you're not.
No one has ever done anything like this.
Zion?
Neo, this is loco.  They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building.  Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him.  Three of them!  I want Morpheus back, too, but what you are talking about is suicide.
Why?
Operator.
It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?
Yeah.
May God be with you.
'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
Listen, try a place with some sun. Swimming pools.  Palm trees.  Girls in little French bathing suits.
It's the truth, I swear.
Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.
Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work.  I swear it.
Shut up!
Johnny, I swear to God, if you open your mouth about any of this...
You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?
Oh, cut it out, will ya?
NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?
I should know?  His wife don't even know.  Probably off with one of his little girls...I don't know.  I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn...Why should I kill myself?
Nope...
I don't know that.  That's what I'm telling you.
Oh Michael, look...
Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
Uncle, how are you feeling?
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...
Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
Oh yes, he's pretty good.
Who knows?  It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like.  When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm "cumpari" with them...so I take an interest.  You live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved.
"Francis Macomber."
It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie.  Listen, I'm looking for your cousin.  Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday.  I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is?  I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all...
Lower the fuckin music--I can't hear nothin.
Ah...there's a funny lookin' cab behind us.
How about me?  I don't get a drink John?
Can you spare it?
Yeah.
That was 'Joe'.
Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---
Hi, Daddy, what do you think?
I haven't been the father to you that --
Paillarde of veal.
I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr. Quince.
Yes, sir?
Hello, Beautiful.
Drew, you're out of line.
Thank you for coming.
We're not getting anywhere here. Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --
I didn't say.
Yes.
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
Who are we talking about?
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
I'm all excited --
I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop --  Instead it was --
No.
I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice.
You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around.
What is there to say?  They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.
What are their feelings?
Whose?
That's it?
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.
You're overthinking it --
He said that?
I nuttin' to do wi' dat.
No, I come to see Doctor.
The Board is waiting.
Thanks.
Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter.
Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.
'Big'?
No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
Yes?
Joe --
I came to see you.
And I'll be a visitor.
Why do you love peanut butter so much?
Where are you going?
Almost.
I'm sorry about --
You're here?
I can tell you the when part.  Tonight.
The 'coffee shop' --
Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --
Susan --
What a good idea.
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
Good morning.
Bill --
So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.
Joe --?
There's one to every rule.
I want to live.
What's it like?
Yes, I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
Are you going to eat your lunch
And more.
Okay.
Yes, I saw you see me.
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
Those were my words, Bill.
Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
I told you to shut up.
Happy Birthday, Bill.
Am I dreaming this?  Are you a dream?
Yes.
When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
I think you know --
Please.  Talk to me --
Get what?
All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.
I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
Drew's aboard?
What is it, Daddy --?
Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
What a night.
I'm still here.  Would you like to dance with me, Susan?
What was that?
Nothing lasts.
I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
How'd you know?
39.
79.
30.
47.
My wife.
So you're holding my calls?
What makes you think he's my friend?
Shit. Wrong room.
Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.
Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me.
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
Jimmy?
Do you remember me?
Yeah.
It's isolated.
I wasn't helping you for money.
Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
His name was Jimmy.
Who?
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
Did you?
They're not looking for him.
Beer, please.
A BEER, please.
There's a dress code?
You tell me.
You've read it a hundred times.
Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out!
Shut your mouth!
Guess I've told you about my condition.
It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
Natalie? Natalie who?
We've got to get him out of here.
Who the fuck are you?
Why?
How'd you know I was in here?
Why?
It is now.
Bullshit.							*
No.  I was in Namibia...
Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
About the Stevens family, I'm sorry.  I know you were close to them.
With Sonny.  110%.
They'll kill Gina.
Yeah?
Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...
You need to consider a few issues.
I got the item.
My end?
We want it back.
Where's that?
The Keys?
Were you born in Havana?
Tell <u>me</u> everything.
Blanca...a rubio like you.  I see her in a dress...an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding...everybody is with couples.  Husbands and wives.  They all pose.  My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting.  ...she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room.  By herself.  In a party dress.  And she looked like she knew she would die alone...  She spoke many languages.  We were in Luanda when she died.  I went to her friends in Mali.  They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos.  He had banking there...I was seventeen and very much into the clubs.  And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance.  Your mother?
Like...?
'Cause you don't lose loads?
Hola, chica.
Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can.
Would you find me...?
You afraid of violence?
How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours?
Packaging?
And there's Dmitri...
White gangs...?  It doesn't track.
The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people, not your people.  No tweakers, dopers, first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us, they ain't doing crime with us.
Where we meeting 'em...?
No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
What is going on...?!
Never heard of him.
Control your men.
I gave up nothing on you guys. Don't worry.  I kept you and Rico out of it.  Only the Feds.  They're on their own...it's all their deal, anyway, so fuck 'em.
Only African he ever "relocated" was a $2,000-an-hour Nigerian model for Gucci, and he got wounded when she took an NBA draft choice to the Super Bowl instead of him...
You mean with the flowers...?
...the lease, the phones, the cars...layers of false ident. Would take the FBI weeks.  How long did it take them?  Three hours? Four?  This means, "We can reach out and touch somebody."  Like Bad Teleflora.
And...?
I think Jos suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate.  And people, who are good at what they do?  They have egos, too...
Conveyance?
So lay it out, my brother...
Then what were we talking to you for?
What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
The Statue of Liberty.
You ain't coming to work?
I can tell, can't you?
You think I'm lying!
Maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens?
That's pretty Freudian, Joe.
Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!
For money.
Tomorrow when some piece like that's scratching your back in a Fifth Avenue townhouse, where'll your pal Rizzo be? Nedicks.
What for?
Joe -- do me one favor -- this is my place, am I wrong? You know, in my own place my name ain't Ratso. I mean it so happens my name is Enrico Salvatore Rizzo.
Miami Beach is the only place for a real hustler. Florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world. They lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes.
You ain't got a chance in hell. You need threads and glitter, baby. A front, hey?
Well, this thought just struck me. It wasn't too long ago I was washing dishes way the hell somewhere in Texas.
What'll happen. I mean what they do to, you know, do with you -- if you can't -- ah, Christ!
Well, just exactly what the hell you think you're gonna do? Die on me?
You get your first palm tree in South Carolina.
If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?
Sounds like they knew you.
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
Ever stationed at Kennedy? Those Florida chicks...
Get lost.
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
Tunnel?
To what?
How do you like it?  Istanbul?
Why'd you do it, Billy?
How far?
You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all.
Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
Just what?
...are you with the Consulate?
What's your father do?
Girlfriend?
She didn't know anything about...I wouldn't have wanted her to.
And you?
No... It looks like your going to have a new court.
The Prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in Ankara reviewed it.
What time is it?
Oh we... we...
'Dem dat hides can finds says I'... I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking looks at it late at night, talking to it.
But you fuck with me. You fuck with me all the time. You make crummy tea.  You rip us off on the hash.
Hey, Ziat, hurry up with the tea will ay!
What lawyer?
Go left.  Go left again till you hit the fork... Then right again. You got that?
Wait a minute-
It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?
He didn't do it!
He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...
A shame.  You looked great tonight.
We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of...
Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...
You give someone a fucking uniform and... Did you hear how he talked to us?
Great crowd.
Oh, no, you were-
Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
It's no use! They know we're in here!
No...
You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here.
It bit you.
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
Excuse me, that's not exactly the kind of information I was after. You see, he's been missing for quite some time now, and...
God told me, since I was his number- one fan, that I should make up new stories as if I was Paul Sheldon. So, went to town. And I bought a typewriter. And paper to type on. The same kind Paul Sheldon used. And I turned the guest bedroom into a writing studio. Would you like to see it?
Well...  ...maybe it takes time to get the hang of it.
Sure.
Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.
Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how I'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights I'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin--  and I'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer.
You're very kind...
What's it about?
Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting?
I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?
But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said "I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way."
I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?
Thank you for thinking of me.  Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?
Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.
I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again.
You can--you have the "gotta"--
Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?
Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
Annie, I think we should have a toast.
Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?
When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian.  I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me.
Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
Paul, this will be our legacy.
Stop--stop right here.
Could be the weight of the snow.
You really think Sheldon's out there?
Just leave it, all right?
Yes.
Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.
Hey, Pete.
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
Has she been buying any odd things lately?
Newspapers?
The word I'm getting is the Times review is gonna be a love letter.
Afraid he's got no choice.  I believe I broke his jaw.
See anything you like?
To win?
God damn it, Nyah!  Why did you do it?  Why did you save that bastard?
Where?
What was the top bid?
What you got there, mate?
We're due to take off.
How're we doin', then?
What can we do' mate?
Would you mind if I'm on top?
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
When they've got your recruiting technique?  Not a thing.
That's not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.
Well, then, what I am I doing here?  I assume I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..
Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together.'
But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.
Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there.
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?
Easy, easy, easy, shhh!
Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?
- you who don't have a conscience.
No.  Should I?
An idea, yeah.
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.
In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
And then what?
Very.
Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.
You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
- good.  Then if you manage to get hold of Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got -  - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera on earth.
I do.
Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.
..I'm fine..and you?
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure..
Now how to get in there.
Luther, I'm looking at security.
So what did he say?
To friends.
Satisfied?
I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this.
Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan.  What's wrong with you?
Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport in five minutes.
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
Who sent you?!  Who sent you?
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
I just need you to be safe.
I'm so sorry.  Krieger was my call.  I've never worked with him.  I'm sorry, Ethan.
Okay...
Two cars.  Where are you?
Go ahead.
I dont think so.
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
What are we downloading?
And I get to keep the equipment when we're done.
I'm not letting this list get out in the open.
It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be close.
Who are you and what are you doing here?
Why, may I ask?
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?
Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.
Claire.
IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!
Ive got a shadow.
Where are you?
Jim...?
What's going on?
Such a nice ass.
Thirty-two and change.
Are you ready?
No, I want to see the dessert cart.
I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr. Johnny.
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
I have my eyes open.
Where's Ma?
You're not sleepy?
You look tired.
Yeah.
The guy died.
It's temporary.
Mona?
What are you doing here?
You're my father.
And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.
Why you looking around so much?
Yes!
Yeah, this is Ronny.
Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!
That's it.
I like it well done.
This is good. Uhh...
Fast.
How many men since then?
Yes.
Stop it!
Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
To the bed.
I'm marrying your brother!
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
But that's cause he don't know!
Hi.
That was just so... awful!
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
What's the matter?
I'm afraid of who I am.
No, I'll tell him.
Bye, Aunt Rita.
Is there anything you want to tell us, honey?
You never have dessert.
What's the matter?
Will you marry me?
Are you proposing marriage to me?
Yes, on the floor.
I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
Yeah.
There's one thing about this wedding I want you to do. Call this number. It's a business number. Ask for Ronny. Invite him to the wedding.
Have you told her we're getting married?
I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying.
In time, you will see that this is the best thing.
Grandma was still alive. Chiro was still home going to school. Now he's married and gone to Florida. If you and Johnny moved in, had a baby...
Hi.
Thanks. What's the matter with you?
What! How do you know?
What about the moon?
Hi, Loretta.
I know.
He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
Loretta...
Have you come to make peace with me?
Yes?
May I presume to ask you a question?
Sorry. That was rude.
Go ahead.
I'm a little cold.
He's a plumber.
Look.
It's Cosmo's moon.
So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.
Burn them.
No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.
There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.
King of the WHO?
The same!
Oh!
Yes ...
Well, what's that then?
You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.
Look!
All right, we'll call it a draw.
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?
And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
Ni!
They're nervous, sire.
What?
That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.
What?
Where?
Behind the rabbit?
... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs.
You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
Yes, Lord.
Well?
The nose?
Make a bridge out of her.
Nothing... There's your ninepence.
That's easy!
I promised I'd be at the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today.
Thanks very much.
Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!
Really, I feel fine, sir.
You killed eight wedding guests in all!
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....
Who are you?
Leaving the room ... yes.
Er ... if ... we ... er ...
Right.
And make sure he doesn't leave.
Make sure he doesn't leave.
Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
Well, look er, I ...
Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
Well ...
Camelot ...
Quick!
They're all saying the word ...
Bravely ran away, away.
I speak as I find, Archie.
She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does.  You want to be careful.
Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.
What's this?
What's your name?
Checked and locked, sir.
Good man.  And is she all right?
Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
What did you say?
Do you know who you address, sir?
Mama...
You'll be sent a message.
Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
No.
I thought I made myself perfectly clear.  You do not leave your room until Her Majesty requests it.
Nobody has any rights over me.
Princes and Lords are but the breath of kings, An honest man's the noblest work of God.  You must miss such magnificent views.
For Her Majesty.
Her mind is set.  She won't change now.
She'll think I betrayed her.
You are well?
And the pony?
Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.
Then why do you persist in doing it?
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.
Those, over there, there.
I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
-- When I took you out riding, come rain or shine, because I knew it was right for you, when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace, when I saw you safe from home to home and you didn't even know I was there...!  All I've ever thought about is you!
Your Majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance.  As for your people, look no further than the sales of your Highland Journals to see in what affection the nation holds their Queen.  You sell even more copies than Mr Dickens.
Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was right.  This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk.  Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close.
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
What's her excuse this time?
The Queen wishes to publish an account of him.
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am.
Unwell?
Read it.
There is one other matter.
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
Why is he not here?
Then why are you not with him?
Could you play ARCADE with that?
We're having some problems with ARCADE...
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
Maybe he's not dead.
Has anyone seen Greg?
So where is he?
So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.
No, in person.  Now.
Happy?
So how did it know my name, then?
We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone...
Well?
Where to now?
This is like a movie or something.  I mean, am I paranoid or what?
Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life.
SLIP-STREAM.
Virgin sacrifices?
Jesus Christ!
You don't get it, do you?
Okay.  It's West.
So that's what we almost died for?
Christ...no time...
Then we'll go home?
I love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you?
"Escape"?
So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies?
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?
Beautiful night.
So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.
Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me?
No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?
Yes...what is it?
How...  how'd they know I was here?
Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
I think so. I was just taking a shower.
Betty Elms?
No, no, I'm fine.
Betty.
I can call them... I can call my dad.
Well ... we'll leave her a note.
Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about?
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
No.... I don't...
It's not my voice ... but I know her.
"You're still here?"
"Before I kill you."
Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here?
Don't stop!
No... but...
I don't think...
No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.
To my audition.
What's  the matter now?
You feel it?
The one of 'em still alive?
Palmdale.
Hardly.
Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
So many tubes to get in, only one is the way out.
You must come in first place to move on !
Is that it ?
You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
There's enough force to push you twenty feet in the air. It won't kill you, but it will hurt.
Come on, it works.
First Bank ? But how ?
McCay knows ?
Hey ! Hey ! I'm talking to you !
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
Do you have something better to talk about ?
I do a very thorough background check. I go through police files, personel files, anything.
There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?
There's more to it than trying to see if you'd steal from the company or if you'd lie or cheat.
It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
If we can get to through the next room, we'll be at a junction for a power grid.
Are you Matthew Parker ?
Give me one good reason why I don't plug you right here, right now ? 
The room has sound sensors. If you wake it up, it breathes fire.
Hey, try swimming. It works.
Is it over ?
Stop the hydraulics.
Hand me the 3/8ths.
Excuse me, sir ?
Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good....
Perhaps it was. I was in boarding school for so many years, it's hard to remember. Do you have the tape of the latest exploits from my favorite hobby ?
Zach, how old are you, son ?
And how much do we pay you annually ?
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
No. I am not a homosexual.
Have you ever considered running your own "Park" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.
Aren't you going to switch exits on him again ?
Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !
Really ? On a date ?
This is too easy, I mean I had a speech prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees to grovel.
Thank you, won't you come in ?
I just want to have something that's mine, you know ? It's like living off of their money is fun and all. There are certain materialistic needs that I have that can only be satisfied with that extra little scratch.
Are you okay ?
I'm talking to you asshole !
Are you okay ? Any holes ? I mean aside from the one's that nature gave you ?
Sweet Jesus I never dreamed I'd be glad to see Central Park at night.
No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
Hey good lookin' ! What'cha got cookin' ?
We start with the top and work our way down. We start with the high salaries and then just let the little people go. No need to make the blue collars go crazy.
Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.
You had to remind me?
Look, sergeant I know I said some things last time that I shouldn't have said at all but...
I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
So charge him with something...who's gonna know?
It's too bad about your mom. At least she went peacefully, I've seen a lot of people go out the hard way.
She was the uhh...first girl ever suspended for smoking.
Visualize a spare?
Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
Seriously.
There's still a big spot on the floor.
Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
She was talented, but honey I wish I could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and I had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, I proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.
Hi honey.
Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up honey.
Maybe he's wet?
His name's Harry Sultenfuss.
And she saved it.
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
Maggie wanted to have a baby...and...umm...I didn't.
That's okay.
What are you staring at?
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
Vada, he was giving you an easy out so you wouldn't have to write about your mother.
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
You know I've been re-reading Virginia Woolf, I think she'd be a natural for you, she led a fascinating life.
There's water in your bathroom.
My parents had a brief, but intensely fulfilling relationship. She's remained a woman of mystery to this day.
I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude.
I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
Get married?
You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.
You ratted on my mother??
Care for a smoke?
I think it's cool.
I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors.
Come and get it.
Uh oh...
Hey look!
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
No?
What's that?
No problem.
But...are you engaged or something?
I had to be, I only have five days. So just point me in the right direction and....
Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door.
He was caressing.
God? No I didn't think you'd want to invoke God Rose, because he saw even more than I did. ROSE Look Phil, if you want the rights of a husband, you're gonna have to ask me something but if not, you're gonna have to get accustomed to the rights of what you are.
I think this place is just fine.
You really think I look sexy in this smock?
You're Nick's mother?
Go to your room.  And you...I don't suppose your father gave you permission to pierce your ears, did he?
Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there.
Bye Aunt Rose.
...It's all in the hands really. You know you have nice hands, you operate?
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me.
They're enormous, I know.
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
What's this? December 8th, 1958?
Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
Did it hurt a lot?
Beidermeyer?
No it doesn't but... I...I wish it did.
Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.
Uhh, it's nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to join us?
Danny?
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
I've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine.
The boss is watching us...
Can't you see it?
Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??
I need the job.
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
Harry, I really think she.....
Hi.
You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry.
What are you wearing?
Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.
Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.
HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.
Hi Vada.
Maybe I should go over and yell at him.
Why not?
He's okay isn't he?
He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
I found this.
Really?
That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
Sure.
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.
Who's that?
No....
Cause she's dying.
No.
He's allergic to everything.
Maybe black means you're happy?
I would.
I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.
Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.
I'm hemorrhaging.
How old are you?
It's okay sweetheart.
I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!
Naah, I don't wanna.
If I do it, can we go?
Your lip bleeding?
Is that your Dad?
Do you remember her?
What do you think it's like?
Heaven.
Sorry.
Can we go yet?
Hey Vada, guess what we got?
Woah!!
Why are you running away?
I do, she's real funny.
You can come to my house for dinner?
You better not either.
Long trip.  Pretty nice of you to come.
Whenever George tells someone how steadfast I am, he always makes me sound boring.
I've lost interest.
You think...
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
Jesus.  You're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m...
Ben Gay.
I give.
Tell him you know this is the worst, dumbest, cruelest moment to do this to him.  But there it is, and he has to choose.
He sucks soup through his front teeth.
But he sure can kiss.
And loving him means loving all of this.
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
I'm not joking.  I had to face up to all my competitive drives, and believe me, I've got 'em.
And the answer was so simple.
Jesus, we're trapped!
It's not just clubs.  This guy always knows the best everything. The best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best Horowitz record, was he always like the...
About Michael's job.
I just think you're wrong, is all.
I mean, he loves his job.
He'll see right through it.
Uh, Kimmy...?
Who?  The jerk who's running your life?
I never want to go through this again.
Wallace egregious residence, Mandy speaking.
If he gives you grief, I'll have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show.
Julianne, reading my son-in-law's mail, is not something...
It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.
I think he's been fired.
And you think he's kept this to himself.
Well, you're a little early...
I've been calling for days!
Well, sure.
No matter how many times I leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down.
Every day.  She makes the bed.
Last zoo we were in was... Beijing, yeah?  Sure.  The rhinos were fucking.
You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.
Big weddings are so strange.
Where did we first hear th...
I'm up against a deadline.
Michael? What ha...
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
The Big Hurt, huh?
I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before...
He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust...
... I'm partial to the tight end.
Maybe it's happy there.
He said you told him.  It'd be safer with you.
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
Am I disturbing you?
What did you say your name was?
It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.
I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. I'm John Triplette... a friend of Del Reese... I was at the airport. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm a great fan of hers. If there's anything you need, just give me a call. I'm at the Sheraton South.
I got trapped and you know it, so let's have some rules.
You want anything?  A drink?
How much?
Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. I need a room
Uh huh.
You know anything about the stations here?
Well, I could use one, especially if I'm pregnant.
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
Who's that?
You in music?
Well, I got to Nashville. That's pretty far.
Fungus?
Well, can you tell me why?
Yes.
I'd really like to see you.
Who is thin?
Hello.
Oh.
You're really terrific, you know what I mean --LINNEA rolls over and faces him.
Just got out. Had me thirteen lawyers. Missed the electric chair twice. .. Been out three months. Are you heavy?
I can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit.
Hello. John Triplette.
An album.
Dent it a little. Boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.
Come on back to bed.
Oh --
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
No -- That's exercises. My coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. Every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. That's the place where I sing.
It's not bad.
Don't you think they'd just love another song instead?
What was the color of Tim's belt?
Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?
What kind of pies do you have?
Mickey!
Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them?
Who isn't?
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
...one night I was asleep, and a noise wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit, somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a gun, so I go into the living room with a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned out to be nothing. God made the noise. Who knows?
How is it?
Not to anybody. She sings.
Mickey, how do you feel about cross- examining Grace Mulberry?
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
Tell me about the purity.
Where's it parked?
We ain't got all fuckin' day!
Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta---
Yes.
Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
Through the power of the simple word---
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
The entire wing?
You can't be serious?
Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your book. I'm impressed. Good work on Curtis Fox.
What's the travelling arrangements?
What the hell happened to you?
Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.
How's it working, Scotty?
But how can you say that?
But you see, that's okay, Wayne.
By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here.
Two guys?
Three.
How 'bout that furniture plant?
Give her a beer.
Boy - you hear me?!
Who're you tellin' to get, boy?! You watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
I said: Cut it out!
What's the matter, boy? Never smile?
James Lee, you come in here and meet your daddy.
Well, she never gave me none. Look, you better find him a place pretty quick.
Yeah. Look, I'll be sendin' you the money from now on.
Don't say much, do you?
Thanks.
Guess so.
His profession?
Hard to get up in the morning, huh?
You know, man, that guy was trying to be friendly.
Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
You working?
Oh yeah?
In Birmingham.
So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?
How d'you mean?
At first it was real strange. Hell, Japan is a long ways from Alabama. Really got under my skin, though. Almost didn't come back.
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
Goin' to see my kid.
Yeah. Well, I do.
How old is your boy?
What's he like?
What happened, Duff?
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
What about them?
Don't look so scared.
Don't, Duff.
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
Hell, if they don't blow up his place, they'll get him some other way. Don't make no difference no-how.
Duff, I love you.
Where' you goin'?
Like a home, for one thing.
Wouldn't have known you.
Want me to hold the light for you?
Seems a little loose!
Come back some other time, will you?
Come on, Pop.
Going back, huh?
They'll run you out.
I know he wasn't much of a father.
Well, it looks like we'll be getting our new school.
Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now.
So I been told.
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
Man, you won't like that back seat.
Well, if it ain't Duff!
I'll be a monkey's kid sister! What d'you want to do a thing like that for?
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
I'll talk to the Mayor.
He's your son.
Your Raoul?
If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.
I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.
And then?
Did you trace it?
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
Yeah, well it's working.
Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream.
You've got your orders.
Tell me the words.
Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
She's ready to go.
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.
Never heard of him.
It's mutating... spreading like a disease.
He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.
Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...
I know who you are.
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.
How soon is soon enough?
I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me.
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
...Feels like you.
When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
Shit...
What?
So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
It is?
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
Remember, that poet that we liked  the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets.
Oh, man! Who told?
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
Forget it.
Cuuuute!
And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
Wannabes. Kirsten transitioned last year.
I think it's pronounced gauche.
Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.
Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
You've done five of my ideas.
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
Yes, urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go.
This is where the stories are. You are going to become friends with these people. You are going to party with them. You are going to hang out with them on weekends. When they go to prom, you are going to be in their same damn limo!
What if I say no?
That's your story!
Hey there.
You having fun?
Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.
I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.
Are you crazy?! You can't do this.
You're twenty-three years old!
Really?  Rob-, that girl is sixteen.
No- not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could you do that to me?  I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age.
Hi, everyone.  I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.
Whoa. Deja Vu.
I love the way she writes.
Hey, Josie, hold on.  You've been hiding something from me.
Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
You have to say that. You're my teacher.
That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
Yes.
Aloha! Welcome!
We followed your instructions.
Shock.
Yes.
Yes.
Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
Taste it.
<i>                      This is a thing called a present. The whole thing starts with a box...</i>
We're here!  You sent for us!
You'd better be quiet, Sandy.
You got your room straightened out yet?
I don't know.  COuldn't get the right price, I suppose.
Wanna join your little friend?
How much longer you figure he'll keep us out here?
So, what about you and that Poletti girl?
You two got a thing going, or what?
So, you live around here.
You hit that ball pretty good, Walsh.
You remember your dreams, Grady?
You're fucked in the head.
I believe you.  You had some scary dreams, okay?
What?
your timing was perfect - I was getting the third degree in there.
Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?
No, that's okay.  I was just...unpacking.
"Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall asleep!"
Here.
Disappointed?
you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  You had another nightmare, didn't you?
You're not being fair to me.  I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.
I'm afraid to go to sleep, I'm afraid to stay awake - I'm ruining your party. They're gonna put me away for sure.
Oh, Christ, you're hurt...
Who, Jesse?
Oh...uh, no, just some milk, Mom.
So, school going alright?
Hi, guys.
Just some answers.  There are other kids involved, its not just Kristen.  All good kids, smark kids.
If you get caught, I never saw you. Deal?
I know who's trying to kill you.
Joey needs us.  I can feel him.
Are you okay?
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
The whole wing's devoted ot this program.  That's your office.
Max, where's Kristen?
It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.
You're late.
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
That's right.
Just until we get things under control.
I can't believe I just did that.
What are we going to do?
Nancy...
Oh Christ.  Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room for the night.  They sedated her.
Who is he?
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
Okay, straight talk only in here.
That's precisely what they need.  Some uninterrupted REM sleep to release all this negative energy.
If he continues having these outbursts, I'll have to have him isolated permanently.
That's enough, Kincaid.
Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.
I'm in.
Hi.
That was such a great evening.
Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
Oh hi.  Forget something?
Probably best not tell anyone about this.
Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We, ahm I work in a bookshop.
You'll have to prove it.  This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it.  State your claim.
Gardens.  All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little villages.
To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
I have thought about you.
'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
You've got big feet.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
Today has ben a good day.  Which under the circumstances is... unexpected.
Wow.
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
Can I stay a bit longer?
Oh my God.  And they got a photo of you dressed like that?
How are you doing?
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.
Excuse me?
But... wait... there are things to say.
Well... how have you been?
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film.
Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
He's bringing a girl?
Does the girl have a name?
Where are you going?
Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
Bloody hell, this is fun.
If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices.
Is this your first film?
Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
What happened?
Have we got something for you. Something which will make you love me so much you'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life.
What do you think?  Good move?
Ahm... room service.
Mr. Thacker?
Cappuccino as ordered.
Right -- want another one?
Max.  This is Anna.
Well?
I think you have forgotten...  what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
Hello.
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?
I'll talk to you in the morning.
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
No -- they're... for my grandmother. She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
M-m-m-ma'am?
All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time.
Pardon me, ma'am, can I ask you somethin'?
Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
I'm not finished yet.
Yeah, it'll satisfy me.
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts.
Welcome back.
What's your name, buddy?
So long, kid.
'K-Kay, M-Mack!
Whatsamatter, kid, what's botherin' you...?
Marry who?
In ya go...
Ahhh, Billy...
Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
She won't give me any more cigarettes!
Ha! Did ya see that!  Hey, Cheswick!
They must be up there!
What?
He's a big flounder. Could weigh two, three hundred. You got to lift him in with a winch.
Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe anyway?
Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?
So why are you talking to him?
Ya owe me twenty-five bucks.
What's your plan, Mack?
Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!
I'm the coach!
Don't you have any clubs?
Miss Ratched. Given all the conditions of that sublime relationship, coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that I held to be sacred, mentally, physically and emotionally, the only thing that I can speculate on, at this late date, is how I will justify the very existence of my life, with or without my dear wife.
Hit me!
Right!
Whadaya doin', there's no one there!
I saw thum! I saw thum!
Gary Blinker's fulla shit!
My, my... Ah, who are you?
Doc, what can I tell ya?
Candy. Candy, over here.  Hey, Doc, time out.
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay
You think it's funny, huh?
Ten bucks.
Yeah, take us back to the dumbwaiter, Mac.
Got a cigarette?
I thought I told you boys to go to bed!
That angel of mercy, he ain't a she, is he?
Ah believe ya, brother. Ah believe ya!
Yes, sir, I sure am gonna enjoy my stay here.
Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.
Don't know if I can hold it that long, Sam.
How 'bout twenty?
The lights were flashing on and off, Mister Turkle.
What are these men doing up wandering around?
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
Is he in an asylum?
Now, Miss. What do you want with twenty zombies when you got a twenty gun salute looking you right in the face.
Your grandmother?
My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?
But...  just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves.
We found each other, didn't we?
You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
Hello?  Is anybody there?
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
Where are you going?
Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
So?
Fine.  Okay.  Forget me.  Leave me out of it.  But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.
Mickey Spillane.
He's out by the pool right now.
Oh, thanks.  Well, have a good time.
What?...
Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.
Yeah.  Well, was the least I could do.
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...
Any night.
Faith, this is my mother.
So, you say you've been to Italy before?
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?
I don't believe in statistics.
So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
I wish you didn't have to go so early.
No.
What's he do?
Have you seen him with someone?
It's still the new year...
I have vacation time coming to me.
I can't believe we did this.  Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
Thank you so much.
I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.
What are you doing?
You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
What's that supposed to mean?...
So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
What did you say to her?
He's heeeeeerrre...
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
Well, nobody can say we didn't try.
That was really sweet...
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Yeah.  Sociopaths.  They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
So...
Well... I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess.
And you are?...
My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  Can you tell us what she's saying?
This is the last one before the wedding, right?
Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.
I thought she'd get a kick out of it.
Larry, you've got to tell her.
Yeah--
And then I saw her.  And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
Well, where are they?
When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.
Why shouldn't we? If we c'n get it we're entitled to it.
This girl and the Father got their hooks in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up anymore.
You said they was only going to talk to him.
Mmhmmm.
Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped
Take the boss loading, kid. For God's sake. I don't want to hurt you.
Father Barry.
They're waiting for him to walk in.
It isn't brains. It's how you use them.
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
What?
Listen, you like beer?
Now what are you doing?
Terry!
Why, Terry, who said it was?
And if you don't?
I I'd like to, Edie, but  there's nothin' I can do. Edie feels subdued, ashamed at breaking down. She rises, and in a low voice says
What are you crying for?
Edie!
Edie... Edie... ..
Yeah, yeah, it's up to me, it's up to me he says it's up to me.
I know what you want me to do!
That  word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.
Charley.
Terry, no, no... .
Edie.
Am I on my feet...?
Pop, don't think I'm not feeling grateful for all you've done to get me an education and shelter me from this.  But now my eyes are open. I see things I know are so wrong how can I go back and keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people aren't living? I'm staying, Pop. And I'm going to keep on trying to find out who's guilty for Joey. I'd walk home with a dozen Terry Malloys if I thought they could help me. I tell you I'm staying, Pop. Pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers.
But you're the one I want to tell what you said over Nolan about keepin' silent when you know the score I'm guilty you hear me? I'm guilty... .
I don't get it!
But you've got to listen to me.
About Edie?
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
Conscience... .  I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
Now listen, if you know who the pistols are, if you see them on the dock every day, are you going to keep still until they cut you down one by one?  Are you? Are you? How about you, Nolan?
You all right, Nolan?
Nice fellows.
I'll go down the line, Kayo, believe me.
You're Terry Malloy, aren't you?
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
I think you could have.
Condolences. How you fixed for cabbage this mornin'?
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.
How do you like them jokers? Taking me for a pigeon.
Didn't you recognize him, dopey. That's Old Man Doyle.
You was our first Supreme Commander, Terry. Keep out of sight and I'll tell him you're out.
Count this.
From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing over here now. I was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an'... .
You know what I mean. Leave her alone.
Tippi-tippi-tim, tippi-tim, Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan...  Gotta dime for a crippled-up docker?
You see, Kayo, the good Lord watches over us after all.
That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.
Not dead?  In a cemetery?
Can't we get out of here?
I've got the ropes loose now. I've got my hands free.  Be careful--Don't change your expression too much.  They must not catch on.
I don't know, yet.  We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to do--I hope I'll know what to do.
But they are not yet one of us.
She pleases me.  Permit her to live in the World of the Snakes. 
She is to be <b>mine!</b>  It is so spoken!
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
Live ones where only the dead should be?
He wants us.
What do you suppose for?
I could make her another Cleopatra...
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
Yes.
You were <i>both</i> in the trunk?  Together?
The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?
But you spoke to him on the phone.
I'll say one thing for Jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much. He was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what I mean.
Jack came out of a bank he just robbed in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen car to start.  Battery was dead.  He looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers him a thousand dollars for a jump. Turns out, Buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing.  Buddy says, I'll take the thousand, but we're leaving in my car, not that piece of shit you come in.  They musta robbed fifty banks together.
Wait in the hall!  I have to get dressed!
Go away, or I'll call the police.
You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up?  You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"?
You're just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you.
They pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want, nobody'll know you.
Just that she got away.
What?!
So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
Let's go to Detroit.
"Fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying."  Seems this woman's live-in boyfriend, seventy years old, complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelve-gauge.  Police found noodles in the woman's hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him.  They'd been together ten years.
Outside of that.
It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?
Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
You find out?
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
There's still time, take me up on my offer.
They found the safe.
I'm going back inside.
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
Isn't that my report you're holding onto?
Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?
Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.
Daniel.  Listen --
Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
You want, I tole you you can come. You all right, Foley.  I like you.
You see what they doing, those posts out there?  Putting up another fence, five metres on the other side of the one that's there.  We wait until Super Bowl Sunday, they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine, ten days.  So we going soon as it's dark.  You want -- I mean it -- you can still come.
Ironic, isn't it?
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
Karen, I told you not to--
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
Where's your gun, your pistol?
Who, Buddy?  Yeah.  He's a good guy. Back when we jailed together, he'd call his sister every week without fail.  She's a born-again Christian, does bookkeeping for a televangelist. Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins, tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob.
That's funny.
I know the difference.  You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there.  So basically you've spent half your life in prison.
You don't act like it.
We still talk, though.
You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do.
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
I mean, romantically.
Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
Don't leave me.
I like your hair.  And that suit.
Oh, God...
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
If you don't, one of those guys will.
He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed his name.  Whoa-- little help here!
So.  What's your point?
Oh, hey, Studs?  We thought you were somebody else.
Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?
Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?
I know what you're talking about.
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
Good God... they're shooting Midge!
I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
Snoopy.  Glenn Michaels.
Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.
You there?
Watch the road, boy.  I like this Town Car.  We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass.
So you still haven't said, how you wanna do it?
Thing I'm worried about is you.
Yeah.  If you can step up and actually do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just talking the talk.
Right now, son.
That was some shit, huh?
What'd you fight, middleweight?
You're not my type.
Moselle Miller?
You fit another Chanel suit in here?
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
He's about to.
No thanks.
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.
He waved to you?
You wave back?
The woman also said he stole her husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol, and some of his clothes.
Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself.
Foley's got it.
Nervous?
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
Earl!  You said the planes were ready but -- but what?
How could you do this?
Didn't you say you told her not to come?
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
She said I was so much like you.  I said, No, I'm not.  I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You made me who I am.
It's tight.
You hear my okay?
I'm out of ammo!
And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened.
No baseball diamonds, Red.
There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.
Listen you guys.  I'm the first plane -- then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you. I'll have the shortest run.  If I don't make it, you don't go.
What do you get for winning?
Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.
Maybe not.  But I need you to know.  I love you.  And I will come back.  I'll find a way.  And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real.
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.
What if the Japanese did invade?
So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.
Quite a bit more rain than usual this year. I hope it doesn't spoil the rhubarb.
Do you believe in all of that?
It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.
Let's go.
What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?
I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.
Do you have to wear that hat?
r was worried about you  You didn't even call. You're always on my case if I don't call..
But I want you and Scott to understand.  Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
I don't get it.
He is kind of cute, isn't he?
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out.  And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
Charlie, let's make love.
I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love  Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
But what has to be different?
What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
What're you doing here?
Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better.  Could you give me a ride to school?
Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.
Oh, Charlie.
I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.
I thought you were...for a while.
Terry, slow down.
You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died.
If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.
It was Beth's idea.
Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.
I was impressed with what you said in English class today.
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation.
But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time.
It's Charlie!
I thought I knew everything about him.
I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
Thank God for that.
The hat business is in trouble.
Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think?
You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?
Does everybody have to hear?
Mom!
My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.
What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?
Would you get that, dear?
Maddy's party.
Where have you been?
Isn't that awfully forward?
You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you.
Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest.
I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing.
Dancing with you.
Congratulations on the math contest, Richard.
I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.
No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you...
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and lifestyles.
Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful?
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three.  We'll start with something easy. What is your name?
What will they be made of?
No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad.  Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it.
What's the matter?
I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.
I was building a doggy door.
What happened to you?
You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you...
I think so.
What's his name?
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
What was that all about? You think he's trying to scare us?
You ever think about running away?
How did it go with your father last night?
Mom...
If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand Americans will be out of work. Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull.
Do you really think so, Andy?
This time. What about next time?
Excuse me, Charles. With all due respect... this is... preposterous! It doesn't make any sense, it sounds as if we're talking about someone else. Pardon the lack of humility, but I've had the distinct impression I was kind of... one of the rising stars around here. And I feel that wasn't just my imagination. And I also think I deserve to know what's really going on here, Charles.
Thanks, you guys.
Aren't you giving an exam?
Don't apologize for me.
Drew!
It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.
We've been talking it over, Andy. Your future that is... We feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with you.
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
Okay... They want you out. It's against the law to fire you for having AIDS, so they make you look like a fuck up. Which leads us to the mysterious, lost file.
Find a lawyer?
So Kenton connected the... lesion, <u>and</u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, Maria... and blew the whistle on you. Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, their rising star... Their behavior is... inconsistent.
Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive...
Beckett?
What?
I know a good probate lawyer.
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
Can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror?
What can I do?
What kind of movies do they show there?
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
Hello?
Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt they were too... "ethnic" is the word she used. She said he would like it if I wore something smaller, less garish, and... more "American."
And, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and grandchildren will live like savages.
We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
Were you pleased with his work?
Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
Sometimes it seems like society is <u>run</u> by these kinds of people.
What's the matter with you? Do I look gay to you?
Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties?
Not when I was in the Navy.
Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?
He was doing a great job.
I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...
Oh, Lord....
Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before....  If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull.
I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
I promised them we'd go back with more light. And that's exactly what we're gonna do..
Just come with me!
'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
Here. Make it easy on you.
You'd die for them?
How many bottles?
What, switch what?
We just keep him locked up forever?
Didn't bite.
Sorry. Thought I heard something.
So why isn't it all bloody?
I <u>know</u> what happened -- he went off on the guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and now he's trying to --
Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
...need those cells from the crash ship. Shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings --
You said we were going to trust him now. You said there was a deal.
You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like --
Oh, lady. If you're in your right mind, I pray you go insane.
Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?
Just shut up, okay?
Well? Is it just the pump?
When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --
I don't suppose....
Imam. Slow down.
Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
And pointless.
I had the impression...from the model... that the two planets were moving as one. That there would be...a lasting darkness.
...then we saw this.
A toast to whatever he just said.
<u>Fuck me</u>. You said "clear."
Such as.
What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.
Aw, this can't be happening to me....
Ain't all of us gonna make it.
Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?
<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.
So much for your nightfall.
To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.
Got your sensors?
Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.
Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.
He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.
Tell the court, Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.
Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
He's trying to form words.
All right --
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
Can we take a dip?
I want her.
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
Not everything. They left a hostage.  How do you feel, Lucius?
Lucius.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
One is in a museum!
'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
Sustained.
However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.
You lied. Where is your tribe?
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
Certainly not.	You're a mutant.
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
What is your proposal?
Twelve hundred years ago.
Sure.	In a cage.
We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
What is this?
It's him...Landon.
Listen-
How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?
Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?
But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?
Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.
WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING!
You're dead, you're fucking dead Elias!
...You keep pouring out that suppressing fire, Barnes. I don't wanna be caught out there with my ass hanging out you hear me?
So what's the problem?
Sarge?
Uh... Bob. Like to speak to you. Take a minute.
Hey Big Harold, gimme your peaches for the fruitcake man.
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...
Taylor! Francis!
Barnes got it in for you, don't he?
You okay man? Neck botherin' you?
You been smoking too much shit babe. Gotta control that. Takes a man down... I remember when you first come out to the bush, you was straight as a...
Hey that's great King, that's great... you take it on home for me, you tell 'em King... got your address right? You know where you can reach men, man. Anytime!
Shit! Morehouse and Sal are short. Fu Sheng's going on R&R, you don't want to send their asses out on an ambush. You got the fresh meat Elias.
Whatcha doing in the underworld Taylor?
And Baaaaaaa! back on you.
I didn't like it.
Indefinitely?
No thanks?
Dine and dance tonight? I've got fifty bucks to throw away.
Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
You can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. I'm only killing time.
It might be worth a Martini to you.
I didn't say anything.
Neatly said...but to the wrong man. The trouble with pretty girls is that they can't imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls. I get tired of it.
How did you meet him?
Nice of him.
There's a lot of night left to live through.
Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?
Us?
Why?
You'll be safe here.  I won't be long.  Help yourself to anything you want. The galley's through there.  You can make coffee if you like.
It did, but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.
If you're doing all this just for me.
Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?
Not this one.  And not Mitchell.
Mitchell was dead enough.
This is it, Betty.  They'll find us again, fog or no fog.
Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.
Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
I'll find out, you know. Perhaps not today--perhaps not tomorrow. But in the end, I'll find out.
I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why can't you give me your confidence?
You won't tell me who you are? You won't even give me a chance to help you?
If I understand what you meant by that.
You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clichs, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?
What are you going to do--toss your job into Puget Sound?  Because I make you think of magnolias?  I thought policeman was something like a soldier.  That his duty came first.  However much he might happen hate it.
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
Mr. Reed, please, for Mr.  Brandon.  Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now.  Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr.  Brandon.
Nice friendly approach you've got. Goble. I could hardly walk when I got out of bed this morning.
What are your rates?
Bluff. You've waited too long.
I go home and paint the kitchen.
And without much discrimination.
Could be.
In case you want to have us followed.
I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing, money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
You'd be breaking the law.
I think we'd better discuss this in my office, Mr. Mitchell.
You nasty, sardonic--
One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
I need a receipt.  Sign your name across the flap.
I knew him. He was easy to dislike, poor chap.
Pearl-handled .25 Automatic, uh?  No, it's a Belgian gun... 6.6 mm.
Where's the shell?
They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
This is the shell.  What about the gun?
No suicide.
You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
And if you didn't believe me?
You'll have to take my word for it.  We don't make slides until we have perfect prints for comparison.
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine.  Where's the girl now?
Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
I believe you won decorations during the war.
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
What'll we do about it, Margo?
Be nasty.
She is beautiful. And young.  No thank you.
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.
To Ann.
Hello.  Anyone for a walk?  Tom isn't, I can tell you.
Thank you.
Committed to memory.  Forever.
Yes...You're not a socialist then?
Are you going to have coffee?
It's everything we wanted.  A very good read.  A terrific piece of work.  So, here's to you and Suez.
What did you think of that Wadja film?
Everyone describes the same process. At first it is exciting.  You're at the centre of the world.  As soon as anything happens, you're the first to know about it.  And there are deadlines a dozen times a day, even more, and that's intimidating and exciting.  Then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off.  Your a clerk in a rather dowdy Office.  There's none of the glamour of television, or the penetration of serious journalism.  You're a processor of semi-official news.  Some people leave at this stage.  Then, if you hang on, and especially if you're promoted, you discover a new kind of pleasure.  You're pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts, by the way you ca judge length.  Ending a broadcast on the dot, having everything run smoothly, selecting a running order that makes sense, knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do.  Professionalism.
I think we're ready now, thank you.  And how was Norfolk?  Did you get on with my mother?
Look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow?
Might?
Shall we have a drink or something?
Uh-huh.  Tell me what you think of this first.
You're so hard.  All right then. I was chatting to some people from the diary page, and the name of Barrington came up.  I expressed an interest...
She's very nice, apparently.  Lives in Norfolk.  And very left-wing. You'll have to watch yourself there.
Delivering gossip and goodwill. It seems we'll both be doing Brighton.  Perhaps you should come too.
Six onion bajees!  Great girl.  Did you shake the mother off?
Big mistake, I think.  You might have learned a lot.
Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
It goes from Henry VIII.  Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II.
Now, are you going to have some more tea?
What would you call it?
Jeremy!  How Fantastic.
We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools.  World history since 1945.  Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.
It was last year.
You gonna pull?
Don't screw around man, pull it!
Talk.
We're wasting time.
Why should I?
Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it?
Yeah?  What?
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why they sent you to LA.  Must be an asshole shortage.
A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it.
Look, Harp.  Don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk.  Let me ride him in.
Forget about it, kid.  They're ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right?  They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public.  Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?
Angelo, pay attention.  There's gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is showing traces of toxins.  PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
Look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight.  Okay?
I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me?
Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay?
What do you want?
I came out here from Ohio a month ago.  Never saw the ocean before.  I didn't think it would effect me so much.  Like I'm drawn to it, or something.  I want to do what you do.  It's the truth.
Those are cold.
Ouch.
Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions.
I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?
Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins.  This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?
No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.
You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!! Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!
Why us?
I'll see you there.
Don't know, only saw one of 'em. Camouflaged. He was there...  ... Those fucking eyes...
We've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. Nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'.
Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
Georgia.
Your uncle will like this.
We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  We would give you a promissory note...
We can reach an understanding on this.
Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?
You looking' for some company?
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
Mind if I turn on some heat?
New York.
Must be dangerous.  Hooking.
Ugly habit, biting your nails.
What's your name, lover.
Get in.  This side.
Better believe it.
Let's talk some more first.
I think he wanted you to tip him.
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
What do you like?
Did you sleep well?
Where'd you go?
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
No?  Why's that?
The Rex.
Was someone rude to you?
Okay.
You always been rich?
Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
Fuck off.
You mean, besides Elvis?  I'm a human being.  Sure.  Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy.  He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago.  They stopped at a gas station.  He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other.  Aw, he was sweet. And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. The chicken hawks were on him all the time.  He hated that. Sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things.  The two of us getting married someday. Having kids.  Stupid stuff.
If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
I've never treated you like a whore.
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
I didn't think so.
Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly.  The young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge.
What's up, where you going?
At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia.  I'll see you in the office.  By the way, about your car...
What!?
What time's diner tonight?
Doing what?
You're being ridiculous.
Did I wake you?
I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and <u>we got him</u>.  You there?
Oh, my god... Edward, no!
All this because of that whore!
I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay?
Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes?  Good stuff on <u>him</u>.
Kit...
Yeah... I know what you mean.
All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away.
Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread?
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
Niece?
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?
In fifteen minutes I can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the Queen.  First, as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand.
Either you're European or badly brought up.
Miss Vivian --
Are you looking for something in particular?
I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
What is with you?
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Yes?
Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
Do you want to know what he did? Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did?  He handed the whole thing back to Kross! On a silver platter.  For no reason!  What was he thinking, I mean, what was going through his goddam head?  Why?  What was all that benevolent crap?  What are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation?  I'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities.
The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
Every ship but the four you sent.
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
He knows I do not love him.
On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.
I asked him what was so important for him. "True love," he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are.
... as ... you ... wish...
But how can you be sure?
I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?
Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, "All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." Three years he said that. "Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened.
Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?
Why should that make such a difference?
It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
Probably he means no harm.
He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
I don't think more than ten.
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
-- Fezzik, please --
You've been mostly dead all day.
Inigo.
Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
They're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part?
You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
It was ten days till the wedding. The King still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse.
Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?
What? What?
She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested.
Rise and report.
Double it. My Princess must be safe.
For the last time -- SURRENDER!
-- and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.
There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. They were both masters.
Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.
She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
No --
We're really in a terrible rush.
He's dead. He can't talk.
Thank you for everything.
Sorry.
Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
You are wonderful!
He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
You're that smart?
You're just stalling now.
A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
Bye-bye, boys.
Guess what.
Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!
Wait a minute.  This is a very big decision.  It might effect the course of my entire life.  I'll have to think about it.  I'll do it.
Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is Boomerang.
But sir, I'm not condem ...
Good, what is it?
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?
According to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
Yes, it's quite possible.
Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
What scheme?
Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no scheme.  I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  It's just a thought.
Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.
Will you get a hold on yourself.
Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal.
It won't run a week!
Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?
Well, it's... uh... it's nice and long... I mean, it's... uh... uh... where do you keep your wallet?
Don't help me.
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath?
Vaaaat???
But he has long hair!
Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.
Always.
Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum. Got dag pa dig.  Bialystock and Blum.
Good.  Good.  We go Motel.
You, Blum go Motel.
Don't forget the checkee.  Can't produce playees without checkees.
Feeling better?
Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.
Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
Smasheroo.  Smasheroo.
Of Siegfried...
Nietzche...
No, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  We want to produce your play.  I have the contracts right here.
Okay.
Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?
Don't know where she got "Marie," but "Samuels" figures. Her boy friend's name is Sam.  Was she in disguise? Or do you want to check the picture again?
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
Very early. Dawn.
No.
She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way.
What do you mean?
Cash.
I live there. Alone.
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
Let's all talk about Mary.
Did you check in Phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...
You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?
I'm in no mood for trouble!
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
She stole some money.
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
Did he say anything about my sister?
Here?
What should I know?
What thing could we be in together?
I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'...
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle...
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
Stay here.
In a hurry.
No, thank you. It's my problem, too.
I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.
I wonder so many things about her now.  Why she never told me about you...  Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
You can't go up there.
We could laze around here a while longer.
The only girlish thing you have lost.
Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 
Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
Stuffy in here.  Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with "Bates' Motel" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there.... 
You eat like a bird.
It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.
I imagine so.
An Institution? A madhouse?  People always call a madhouse "someplace."  Put her in Someplace!
What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
Thank you, Norman.
In quite a hurry.
No, m'am.
You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?
Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off... it'll make the girl feel better, Albert.
Norman? Sheriff Chambers.  Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we got some worries here. Did you have a man stop out there tonight...  Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway. A private detective, name of...
Just coming up to ring for you.
I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?
They thought she'd be coming to me.
Yes.
You didn't find anything.
No mother.
Imagine--she was alive. What a horror. Could have been buried alive. She must have run away from the morgue.
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
He's inherited a fortune.
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
What made you steal? Are you hungry?
Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
No, no! I won't sign any pa- pers. You can't make me--
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh 
How do you do.
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
Take me down there.
What is it now?
By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.
But it was really my fault.
Meaning what?
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
Let it go.
No kiddin'.
I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
Ralph, come here a minute, will you?
Yeah. I suppose you people will crucify me for something I didn't do.  I didn't! You understand that! ... I didn't do it! She -- tried before -- 
That's what I said.
I see. Was that all she said?
You weren't going with her?
I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
I came back for some of the books. I am trying to straighten out the accounts. I don't hope to impress you, but I may as well tell you: We haven't a farthing!
But I have some friends waiting.
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
What was her name?
Could we go somewhere?
Could be.
Of what?
What did it want?
But who were they?
In what sense were they bad?
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill.
Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.
Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.
Don't mention it.
Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
Buddy, you're just a child.
You better quit that.
I sure hope you don't.  I gotta get outta here, good night.
Here comes Daddy.
Hi, Buddy.  How's my sweetheart who never told on me when I was bad?
Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.
Of course not!
I never saw anything like it. How did she pick him up so fast?
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.
That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
Open that door, damn you!
Brother, when I have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night.  And you weren't reading Huckleberry Finn. I looked and its not in your room. Now what were you doing?
Heh, what a hypocrite.
Wow! Brrrother!
Why is it taking so long?
I can use a drink after the plane ride I had.
How could that be, son?
It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here.
Go ahead, Doctor, I think I am following you.
Please do.
Turn up your hearing aid.
Well, let's hope for the best, darlin'.
I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house.
Lay off of that stuff, son. It upsets your mother.
I wish you wouldn't pick on Rose and tease her like that. Of course her clothes are silly, but she's ignorant, naive, she doesn't know any better.
He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
That sulky boy was here again this afternoon. I was almost scared, he wouldn't go away.
-- I am not responsible for her epizootics and I did not bring about her epizootics. Now listen to me. When I have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes --
I'm sorry, darlin', I hate it as much as you do.
She hasn't actually done anything...
Honey, Rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life. Now I don't think --
You're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is, what are we going to do?
Ah, ha! Hold the phone! No forwarding address, huh?  In the shock of this brilliant move, I forgot something.
Honey!
Well, thank God we are rid of her at last. And the best thing of all is that she's happy. The little nut is happy, she found Mr. Right in the nick of time!
Yes, sir.
All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk... about this thing, let's discuss it.
Goddamn you, girl! You've made me make a fool out of myself, damn your hide, but let me tell you I am standing at the pass of Thermopylae and I won't budge! The very idea, my own home with children in the house, to say nothing of my wife -- oh-h, you had better believe I am standing at Thermopylae, you little nut, you had better believe it! What are you, crazy? A man is supposed to be a fool like this, but a woman is supposed to have some control and sense! Are you a nitwit? What's the matter with you?
What have you got in your hair, girl?
Is this ill right?
Well, Rose, my sleep was a little disturbed last night, and so was Mrs. Hillyer's, and so was the children's. How about you? Was your sleep disturbed, too?
Strange voices, Rose?
Ohhh-hh, ohhh...
Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it.
I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.
I mean a human investment, Rose, we care about you, you matter to us. But we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop. Do you hear me?
There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!
Well, it was a silly question.
Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and I hadn't ought to of done it. But I'm only a human girl and I... I ain't always perfect. I promise I won't let him in the house no more, I promise. Won't you and Mrs. Hillyer forgive me?
God forbid. You're not sick, Rose, forget it. Don't get any notions in your head, you're not sick.
Your baby?
Well, I am in the construction business, Buddy, and without braggin' I have done real good at it.  There are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me.  Right now I'm buildin' a giant motel unit near Alexandria, outside Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm on the construction side.
She didn't marry him, though, later she married another guy and went to Winston-Salem. It didn't last That girl couldn't have no lastin' marriage, she left him and married another dumb sucker and went out west. Little bitch left him, too, and you know what she's married to right now?  A kike. That's right, some kind of kike horse doctor named Schapiro out in Seattle, who's got the nerve to have the same first name I got. Wouldn't you know it, Rose would wind up married to a goddamn kike? She was always out of her friggin' head and I'll tell you why.  Buddy, she was sick in her mind and between her legs, too. She was a nymphomaniac.
You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I.  You'll have to admit she had four husbands.
Well, got to get a plane to Savannah. Great running into you, Buddy. Give my best to your Daddy.
I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.
What's the matter with him?
Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.
Don't worry, Madam, she can't infect your dear little kiddies. She long ago fully recovered, but the disease did irreparable damage. The girl is permanently barren.
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
Well, she finally let me look in her mouth. Is it true she's never been to a dentist?
Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth.
Yes, and it's very bad. It probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia.
What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?
Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.
I don't think we ought to discuss this in front of the children.
Rose, you're very sick. You're burning up. Rose, can you hear me? Rose?
You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!
Hasn't he got enough problems, or didn't you notice that's not cream soda on his breath?
Come on, don't you screw with her, please!  You... you got to want this: armored car job.  CalTrust Bank. They took two million in cash...
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!
Three hundred kilos of White Lady hidden inside a giant bust of Abraham Lincoln.  A parade float.
Kittle...
How's your precious little school-marm today?
I can work this.
This is too fast.  This is <U>way</U> too fast!
They... they shot me.
Happy Independence Day.
Why do I always have to sit in back?
Where we going?
Don't talk like that.  There's plenty of women around for jerks like you.
Billy, I love you I really do... but I've got to tell you, every day, in every way, you give new meaning to the word "stupidity."
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.
You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest Joe?
Couldn't have said it better myself.
I just think you should show some respect.  I mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom...
Yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  They couldn't go doing everything at once.
I'm gonna get beside him.
You... SUCK!  You almost got us all killed!
I can't believe I'm hearing this,
You need a doctor.
You get him?
How'd we do?
Hey-Ho... !  Maybe we're not alone in this thing after all.
You're... you're not doing what I think you're doing... ?
You suck at lying, Archie.
This much powder you don't throw in the trunk with a blanket over it. It's got to be smuggled.
The gang's all here!
This shit was Ming.
Where's your pet gorilla and the female Uncle Tom?
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.
The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.
I can't do it, Ben.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
Yes, my Master.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
I...
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.
What are you telling them?
What did he say?
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
Over there! Two more of them!
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
Then you know why I have to face him.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
You cannot hide forever, Luke.
Well, I'm sorry.
Yes or no will do.
Why you - what have you done with Janet?
You tricked me.  I wouldn't have - I've never - never.
Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.
He might be.  I don't know.
Yes.
Oh Janet
What was that bang?
Yes, the rain has been very heavy.
Good God.
You're OK by me.
You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?
Promise you won't tell Brad.
What a guy
"Sweet Transvestite"
On the day I went away.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime. That ain't no crime.
I think you had better both come inside.
...Aren't you skating?
I would say you're very shy by nature.
Some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me.
Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
...Guess.
D'you really wanna call?
Why?
It's only temporary.
They're all the same.
Yo, I'm not comfortable either.
...T-thank you.
How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV?
Don't you open them anymore?
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
...And he called the reporters --
...Are you going to say anything to him?
What was that you said about a pet shop?
What did you say about a pet shop?
Is everything all right?
...Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me, I'm not ready for this.
Do me a favor -- His lungs, punch 'em out.
Oh, Rocky!
Nothin'! I want nothin' from you!!!
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
Don't do that again!
I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty.
...That boy damn near broke my arm.
Man, I rearranged his face with that right -- The people love what's happenin' tonight.
My side.
Yo' bleedin' inside, man -- Get that doctor.
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
Ten minutes for ten dollars.
Nine minutes!
Seven minutes!
Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen -- The ringside audience is spotted with blood. This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall --
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?
Ya sure?
Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.
Mr. Balboa --
What?
Did you hear what I said?
Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh?
Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work...  Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?
How old?
More like thirty.
The legs must be goin'.
Rice is a bum.
Hey, ever think about retirin'?
Think about it.
What's happened is freak luck.
What cha say, Benny -- Meet 'The Rock.' This is our cutman, Benny Stein.
God bless ya, Rock.
How I look out there, Mick?
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
Yo, Paulie.
Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
Help what?
Y'know, d'ya think you an' my sister -- Ah, doin' good together?
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
Yo, Rock. I made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man -- Thatta dog?
Is it true the most you've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars?
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.
Do you think the rabbit did it?
So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?
Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
What was <u>that</u>?
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
What's that comin' from the bar?
He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
Men?  They look more like weasles to me.
Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court.
Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
How did you get onto Doom?
Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
Maybe.  Why?
Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
If I don't make it back here by ten...
Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
That's not blood.  That's ink.  That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day.  Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.
No, kid, you're a real hero.
By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
No better?
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.
Is the day so young?
Out--
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! Serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead-- [Benvolio Snickers] Dost thou not laugh?
Farewell, my cuz.
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
I'll not endure him.
Hold Daughter!
I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua.
Good marrow, father!
There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.
What, daughter are you busy? Need you my help?
I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!
What?
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
So thrive my soul--
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less.
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
Do you have it?
We kept it...
And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever's left to be cleaned.
I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry from the States.
This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?
Not to me, you know that.
Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to me, and if you are you're a dead man!
Good Christ!  Can't you lose these jokers?
You better be careful, Seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix.
Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.
I'm a patriate.
Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself.  And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.
It's quite satifactory.
Alright, Gregor, I'm...
What do you mean?
Here's yours.
Sit, sit...  Would you like one?
What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together.
So, you've got it all figured, do you?
Bullshit!
Then where is it?
Gregor, is that you?
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
So what do we do?
A means to an end, is that it?
Hello, Jean-Pierre.
He's tough, your American friend.
And you respect him.
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
American.
If I was healthy, I could take that away from you.
So what is it you want to know?
The point remains: we could be working for different people.  There's a chance for one of us...  Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others.  I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for.  It can help prevent a great deal of...  ...unpleasantness.
Long enough to shoot back.
What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?
I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
I ride with fat-boy...
Where is this broad?
Is that right?
Cigarette?
Pretty much what you'd expect.
He says this is their block.
Something like that...
That was a nice move you did on our young friend.  Judo?
What's the difference?
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
What's going on?
I borrowed that, too...
It was at that.
Alright, it's done.
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
How could you have done that?
What the fuck happened?
It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto.  Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?
You have to stop doing that!
Why's that?
You slept with her!
What the hell happened here?
Ready to roll, partner?
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
What the hell...
Ten thousand right here.
We don't know that.
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
I don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?!  We're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway...
It's the right thing to do.
I should have known something like this was going to happen!
Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.
I can't do that.
And how do you figure we do that?
Look, Earl.  We gotta go straight. This is all messed up...
How long is it going to take?!
Here it is.
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!
Do you have everything?
We've got to go now, then.
Booth, listen to me...Booth!
We got to get out of here.  Do you understand?  We got to get out of here right now!
You're the one who's nuts! There's no one left to touch us, Booth.  We're home free!  We just plant a little of the money on Dwayne, and it's all ours.
And you're solid on that?
I'm all ears.
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
I don't like getting grilled by that DEA bitch, I don't like taking that kind of heat!
I was beginning to think you weren't going to show.  That can't be all of it.
Come on, Booth.  Don't let him do this!!!
Whoa, Earl!
Could it have been in the Mercedes?
Well, we have one lead and that's what I'm looking into next.
There's an ATM on Speedwell Avenue.
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong.
A satellite dish?
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
Yeah, I've seen him.
I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.
Be more specific.  A month, a week...
And what's that?
What is this?  Don't be stupid man...
What do you think about all this?
Well nothing audible to us.  Maybe the lab can pick something up.
Mr. Curtis called us this afternoon. The bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop.  Came through a store called After Midnight.  There's only four employees, none of them can tell us who passed them.
Hello.
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and Im a busy man.
About what?
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
What's this?
Nothing.  Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went?
Whatever...
I'll settle for a third of that.
What do you mean?  You gambled it?
There was this raffle going on at the station, some charity or church was running it, I forget, so I figure what the hell put in my five bucks...
We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.
But nowhere near three million dollars worth.  I would say maybe twenty thousand.
Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane.
That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.
No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
Two-hundred thousand!
How'd you know?
So tell me what you know.
San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?
Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.
I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
Oh, you American?
Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong?
Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I want the truth.  Is there any way I can date your daughter?  Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...
I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.
You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two.
This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover.
And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!
Where are you going?
What, leave you alone so he can cap you?
You're not very good at this, are you?
Five years ago, my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.
It sounds impossible --
Who?
Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
No.  It was my singing.
She's just standing around -- not doing much.
Is it hot in here?
I don't understand?
Pick it up!
She saved our lives.
Fine.
Yes.  We have heaven.
What's a Chinese heaven?
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
Steamed dumplings?
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
Hello, Benjamin.
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
We're slowing down.  This must be it.
Let's go.
You go after Ricky.  I got this.
We made it, man.
Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I can't take this.
What is this?
First class.
Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone.  You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation.
Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.
You're just like your father, Lee.  All these years hiding behind his badge.  I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change.  When you think about it, I didn't really kill him.  I just put him out of his misery.
I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a man who used to train with you.  He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal.
Chin, you have been ordered by the Ministry of Public Security to assist the FBI and Secret Service with our investigation, to provide us with whatever we need.  If you have information, it belongs to us.
You know what a phone booth is?!
Lee!  It's him!
Shut up!
He was just doing his job.
You talk very fast.
You have one of these?
That silly-ass look on your face.
Where were we?
What about them?
You make the plate?
The license!  You get it?!
I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened.
When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?
You talk too fast.
You like it?
You want more?
Are you OK?
Want some?
No, please, I don't --
I'm sorry, Lee.
What are you doing here?
No, it is China, my country, my history.  If any of it gets damaged...
It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo.  My country asked for the best.  I told them that was you.  Now I will show you around my hood.
You're killin' me here.
Last night's as much my fault as yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --
Well.. I wouldn't want to be in the way.
You got a lot of guts calling me.
Any demands yet?
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
You a cop or something?
This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment.  Make him think you don't trust him.
You know something? Every time I see this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a double latte grande...  With two shots of non-fat milk.
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
You sonuvabitch.
And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
When were you going to tell me you were not going with us?
At the wedding?  You invite him?  Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?
What do you expect me to say to this?
Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad.
How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
God... Of course.  I'm sorry -- I mean, I'm...  Brian -- I've got to go.  The man's a lunatic, but I know exactly where he's going next.
We do it to our dog.
Tell me, why does Maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding?  She's already done this.
"Nothing but net."
I love his eyes.  I just believe they're listening to you.
Is that what I did to you?  Is that what happened?  Did I just not see you?
Maggie!
No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?
Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.
Of course we are.  Of course.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
Get this man a Kamikaze.
You could have told me you were fiance number three.
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
About her upcoming wedding and all.
I am just such a reporter.  And you are?
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
I hope you have a different angle. It's pretty much all been covered.
How romantic.
Grandma made me the cutest outfit.  I can't wait to show it to you.
You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.
You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.
I think so.
It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.
I'll have the same.
Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.  This is "King of Blue"!  This is the original recording.  Hard to find in good condition.  Where did you find this?
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party.
It's fun!  It's high.
No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.
About a minute...?
Yes, you!
I'm okay with that.
You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career.  So, what are you doing here?
Does it matter?
You were not.
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.
Grandma!
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.
I'm really rooting for this one.
A harmless joke.
Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.
Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
The short one with black hair is your cousin Irene --
And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --
If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
When you get back, I'll be gone --
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.
I told you.  Nothing --
It's not true, but it feels true.
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- 
Can too.
Did you talk to him?
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
Are his folks nice?
It's silly, really.  I mean, I'd seen him at the office, obviously I'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and I got his lettuce and tomato on white.
Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?
It's you.
Which means --
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
Why not?
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.
You'll find out.
Write her.
This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --
Not.
What?
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica.
Like do you believe in heaven?
I'm starting to forget her.
Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.
What's wrong with Annie?
No.
When I found you?
Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
Do you like baseball?
You saw her in the airport and then here?
We can't finish the job.  She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --
Is he there?
I read an article about this ...
I mean it. I know your work record. You were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that? You had a real future with this company, but you let those Reds stir you up. And now they'll sell you down the river. Why don't you wake up, Ray?  That's your name, isn't it, Ray?
Are you going to let us pass -- or do I have to call the Sheriff?
Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law, you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.
Got any more ideas?
Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
Question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
Why are they singing, Mama?
Where you going?
First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.
I did not mean to weep again. Why should I weep for joy?
Was it expensive, the beer?
What's the matter?
A fighter, huh?
It's not fair ... I should be there with them. After all, I'm the one who got the women the vote.
Yes, I do. There's Ruth Barnes.
Must've been some experience for you, huh?
I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
Did you have to sign a pledge? Not to go back to the line?
We've got to have a talk, you and me.
Where are you going?
Ramn -- you can't.
But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad.
You mean you're ready to give up?
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
Why didn't you support her? You're the worst of the lot.
That's all right -- it's no secret. My name's Hartwell. I'm from the company's Eastern office.
No. New York.
No ...
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
But you don't pull a strike when the bosses want it -- so they can smash your union. You wait till you're ready, so you can win.
And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...
No, I don't mind.  That's how come I told you about it.
What can I do for you?
What?
Ride 'em cowboy)
Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
Yeah.
Could be worse.  Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
What?
Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers?  I hate the son-of-a-bitch.
Miles Davis. "All Blues."
It gets me through the day.
He knows where I work.
From day one.  I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.
Colette, go.
I knew that if these were the guys I was looking for, I'd have to set up a deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able to walk away from it.
How you holding up?
Where to?
Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.
Finland is a country.
Jimmy, where do you find these people?
You wanna score some go-fast?
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
You're going to have to explain that one.
You ever see Queen Elizabeth sleep?
What does J.F.K. stand for?
Was he the president?
Danny?
What's this?
But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
Okay
I don't know... a little. I wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning.
Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there?
You don't understand.
Can we talk price?
You want to do this some other time?
I'm sorry?
Don't address me.  I didn't make the accusation.
Now get talkin'
Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
What the hell is this?
Danny, I'm touched.
You think I'm a Judas?
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
I was getting to it.
What the hell are you doing here?
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
I met the guy at a party.  He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
That's because he doesn't have one.
Took a pig-slicker to the heart.
Whatever you say, man.  Look ... can we talk about this?
Jimmy?
He's the only one I told.
What's on the other end of this thing?
You know, I'm starting to think I'd rather take my chances with Domingo than go through any more of this shit.
Nervous?
You, madam, are a heartless wench.
Tom, let's spend the night here.
Tom, quit fucking around.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
What is that? Rum and coke?
Good luck, John.
So, where are you from?
As a matter of fact, I am.
I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.
In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.
I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family.
Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel with dual-groove, parallel rifling, elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer.
Jackson?
Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch.
So, that's Ryan.
Yes, sir.
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
No kiddin'?
Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...
We left them eighty-eights.
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
Not yet.
How about that jeep?
But you could have gotten killed and I...
Good luck, Captain.
What'd you say, Captain?
Captain, what about our deal?
You?  Leading a squad?
I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.
A couple of weeks.  It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for loading.
How about...?
And how do you bluff yourself?
You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive.
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
Strides through the chaos, avoiding the passing vehicles.  He sees his men and walks toward them.  Reiben hurries up to Miller, pleading.
Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for?  Cheese.  The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France.  There is no bright side.
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
No, sir.
Scans the Germans with his binoculars.
Looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, Captain.
Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically.  IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous.  But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir.
Goddamn it!
Yes, sir.
Who cares?
I usually like surprises.
But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men.
I don't know, I kind of like Wade's idea about the cruise ship.  I've never been to Tahiti.
Demolition, right?
You think he really believed it?
What's the profile?
Jesus.  What, I live in a palace, right?  I have guests here.
Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake.  I have people here.
The, uh, Cynthia Branson estate was worth how much?  Because her family...
Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.
Gee, it's easy.
Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
I don't feel anything.
I told him to be himself.
You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
I wrote sixty-three songs this year.  They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.
I didn't think anyone would get it.
What are you doing?
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
I won?
God, I'll have to go on a plane.
Don't do this to me. You're too good at making me nervous.
Well, let me start it.  I'm flying down to Los Angeles on business, and I decide to take her on her first aeroplane.
You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.
It doesn't feel right to me.  I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.
What happened to you?
Honey, it's not what you think.
Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
Hello.
Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out.  Do you wanna go out?
Well...
What are these?
So we can finally talk?
Have a good sleep.
No, I'm serious.
Then call me tomorrow.
After work?
You have to meet Bess.
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
Are you comfortable?
I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
What?  This is a good level, isn't it?
I think that we should spend some time apart.
Okay, what did we just decide?
It sounded like you did.
Did you tell anybody?
What do you want?
Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.
What?
How's it going?
You're freaking out here man.
YEAH!
PAIN!
The guy with the Datsun?
Yeah, she is.  Good luck.
How ya doing?  Is she around?
Yeah Lloyd.  What are your plans for the future?
Seriously, Lloyd.
I know
She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
Diane Court.
Oh, I was just going to...
I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
Give me my firebird keys!
Later for you, Luke.
Well, let's find him.
What's your name?
It's not a charade, all this?
What are you, Moses?  What is this? Where's the money in this?  What's the scam?
If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  But how?
Where are the guards?
Ghetto Police.  I'm a policeman now, can you believe it?
Like this?
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
That'd be fine.
I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  We're doing well?
You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure.  You have to think of it in his situation.  He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people - he's got a lot of things to worry about.  And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people.  Never the good, always the bad.  Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this.  He'd be all right.  There'd be just the good aspects of him.  Which is a wonderful crook.  A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...
I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
Four hundred, four fifty -
There's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines.  I don't think that's a good idea.
I'll talk to you later.
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
What's he done that's so bad - take money? That's a crime?  Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war?  We're here to make money, all of us.
He's stealing from you, Oskar.
I can do it, Captain.
Don't. Think Bailey.
Shit.
Cici. Who's this?
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
I thought you were going to the mixer?
Cotton.
I don't think that's a good idea.
I did that.
It helped me realize one thing.
Its perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. Im the victim.
Look, I'm sorry about the face.
Do I know you? You look familiar.
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
What are you going to do?
I could use some therapy.
Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.
Lemme take you home.
This is exactly what I don't want.
My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
Yeah, were trying to send a message to Hollywood. Im really getting tired of all the happy endings. Its just not reality. In the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.
She's got guards with her.
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
Youre the one who got away.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.
And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.
Who is this?
I don't play games.
What do you want from me?
Sidney. Hello. How are you?
Yes, goddammit!
I have rehearsal.
The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting away, running...
The young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again.
I've been waiting for you, baby.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
Perfect. I'll be outta Micro-bio and we can grab a bite.
..this week's TKE kegger...
What do you care? Let 'em have their fun. So, what's up?
Do you want to die?
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
You ass.
What do you want?
If he's innocent he'll have an alibi.
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
Really? You're such a talented actor.
What kind of a game?
It's CICI! Cici's the name of the character she plays in the movie!
What?!
Yeah.
Listen, I'm busy. Nobody has access to those files except studio execs. Can you please go away now?
What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?
That's Sidney Prescott's mother.
I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.
Is that a threat, Detective?
Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.
Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.
What?
Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
What about me?
Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.
What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out.
Your life?
You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
Listen you sick bastard, what the fuck do you want?
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
Possibly.
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.
I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
What'd he say?
Oh shit.  Hello? Director's office.
You're not happy with your part.
Who's this?
But you know my favorite name?
Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with these re-writes. It's like every five minutes there's a new script. God, and you just know this all because of STAB 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting.
What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
No.
Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott.
If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.
WHERE?
Yeah?
Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can finish this.
Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
Duh... that's quick.
Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise -- Stu, I believe it's your turn.
Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
Nope.
It's on the table.
I thought she was dead.
FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!
My dad's in the other room.
It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.
Jesus, SHIT!
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
I thought you were...
Jesus... fuck, that hurt.
I think you have the wrong number.
Hello.
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
Why do you want to know my name?
That's not what you said.
I'm two seconds from calling the police.
I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone.
Where are you?
...please...
Michael... Michael Myers.
...leave me alone... please...
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check out a possible lead. Thought you might like to join me.
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
Where is she?
Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
I heard screaming.
Stu was with me last night.
Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie.
For about two seconds.
Jesus, this place is packed.
She's saving herself for you.
What's Leatherface doing here?
Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.
You're crazy -- both of you.
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
Or a man's mentality.
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
What do you think about when you're having sex?
How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
TATUM!
There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.
Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?
Because there's no way a girl could have killed them.
Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened?
I don't have anyone else to give this to, Somerset, you know that.  And nobody's going to swap with you.
How's that?
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
You've left unfinished business before.
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?
Did you read in the paper today, about the man who was walking his dog?  he was attacked, and his wallet and his watch were taken.  And then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes.  It happened four blocks from here.
Thank you.  Tell them, thank you.
What the hell's going on?
I can't wait for you to see.  I can't wait...  It's really going to be something.
Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.
Just keep leading the way.
Somerset...
There's a bucket here.
It's a package deal.  You get the phone with the office.
It's my wife.
Did you read them?
No fingerprints?
You're sure your men didn't move this?
And?
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
Victor's landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month.  He says, quote, "I never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment three-o-one, and nobody ever complained about him.  He's the best tenant I've ever had.
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
How do you know all about this?
This is a waste of time.
Well, there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room, and near as I can tell, each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages.
The irony is, after a day of the type of work he did, he'd come home and read me these morbid crime stories.  Murders in the Rue Morgue.  Le Fanu's Green Tea.  My mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours.
Well... what the fuck, man?
Slut.
Throw your gun down now!
It's nice to meet you.  My husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.
Don't worry.  I don't wear it at the dinner table.
How long have you lived here?
Perfect example.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
You askin' me to clear out now?
Lucy's going on seventeen now...
Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?
Another one, eh?
What in...?
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
If there's anything I can do, sir...
But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?
Ay-eh...They was here...
Leggo my arm...You look mangier 'n ever.
And maybe you lie...
I beg your pardon?
Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...
Martin...I want you to know some- thin'...
Futterman?
What I heard back there was that a band o' hostile Nawyeckas came through this way less'n two weeks ago...
You ask her!
Think she means for us to follow?
Least, <U>THEY</U> won't feed any Comanches this winter...Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country.
Why didn't he make his move back there?
How? She's even forgot her own language!
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.
She's not a little girl any more.
'Dear Miss Laury'...He spells it with a Y instead of an I...E...Wouldn't you think he'd know...
The <U>late</U> Mister Futterman?
Every young man should at least once...Go on, Laurie! Read!
They never find that girl.
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...
Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...
I have to cut his windpipe...
Ellen, move aside...
I miss Tommi so much.
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other?  Honesty - trust!
Where have you been all day?
Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.
You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.
Oh, Ellen!  I've been wondering when you'd come.  Why don't you step in.
I really hate to bother him, but...
That's alright.  Don't misunderstand my husband.  It's only that he's already had enough problems with this case. And who would believe him if he told the truth?
Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.
And that is?
Mrs. Straub!
Oh, Mrs. Straub.  May I introduce you to my wife?
Stop scaring people.  Let's go. We need to be on our way.
Damn, this thing is heavy. Where do you want to have it?
We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of Verona
You did not like the speech?
I know your face. Are you an actor?
Tomorrow.
We have no Juliet!
There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?
Are you writing?
A woman of property?
What's the title?
So what do we do?
How?
Is it going well?
God be praised!  Locked?
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
I feel a scene coming on.
Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good!
We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.
Nobody. The author.
Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
Ethel.
Good luck with yours, Kit.
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?"
But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
Well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.
Your Majesty.
What do you love so much?
And--?
You left it in my bed. Come to look for it again.
Will!
Master Shakespeare
"The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek.
She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
Better fortune, boy.
My lady!
Anon, good nurse. Anon.  Master Shakespeare?!
Oh but why "alas?"
Oh my lady, my love!
Can you love a fool?
Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.
Moonlight!
Oh, let Henslowe wait.
Oh, Will!
"Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
I know how to fight!
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
I have spoken with your father.
No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
I am very sorry, sir, I have not seen Act Two.
I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player?
Oh!--it's--it's--oh, it's a house of ill- repute!
"Poet?"
Here we come at last, my lord!
An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win.
What do you think?
Alex, I don't have the time --
So who's going to do it?
Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do --
What's the problem?
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking bin-bag', I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the full there.
What's all this for, more security?
Not eating what?
Who?
It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen.
They know.
What?
Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
I don't know them.
Well, is it?
Just one thing.
Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
Cameron.
When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?
And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are the sunshine of my life'?
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things.
Who was it?
Have you seen Hugo?
I don't thinkI can.
Look over there. It's Cameron.
Will you calm down.
Boy, am I glad to see you.
What?
Of course, but I think you'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed --
It makes us feel a whole lot better.
Don't you ever stop?
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
Two?
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
Loks like you had a break-in up here as well.
Yes.
What?
But I bet you didn't say you were going to split on him.
Hello.
It's nice.
I write about it?
Both, sir.
You can tell by the intonation.
Anyway, you remember Harold?
I don't know, I think...
I thought you were in a good mood.
-- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear --
Lester.
-- is that right?
Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?
Thanks a lot.
Yeah, I think so.
She did?
You're late, George.
Nummers.
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.
I can see that.
What about?
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
She what?
Like what?
Well, is she your girlfriend?
You here to see my mother?
Did you hear me?
Well, are you? Are you queer?
That you're just like your mother.
And you need money?
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
Yes, Buffums.
You promised you'd do the show.
You don't seem very sure.
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
What's wrong?
No.
Why not?
Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud. At least he should give me a Ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something...
You know what I'm talking about.
Now, baby... if I told you about her... then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore... could you?
Baby...
Sit down.
-- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green...
-- what guy?
-- don't you want to --
-- gee...
-- where'd you go?
Why?
Well then what are you trying to do-
Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for God's sake, answer me.
-- Right after I sprayed her?
I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone.
Yeah?...
What with?
-- White ladies?
That boy always does great. He's a corporal or a squad leader or something, just wrote me from some place called Kwang Due?
-- took a bus.
Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas.
Call me!
There were some shots.
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
You're great.
But in the same house, you know, one house.
You've never even been around one.
Yeah.
Go where?
When can I talk to you?
Never mind. Where've you been?
Well that's something.
That was him.
-- and take this with you.
What do you wanna know for?
What difference does it make?
-- yes.
Please!... that's not like you.
Stop it.
George...
No.
But the important thing is you're successful at it.
Well, George, you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me, but I invest for myself and a lot of particular people.
Tonight?
You look like you've had quite a work-out.
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?
All night.
I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment!
Want a drink?
What about Jackie?
You really think so?
Oh, by the way, I think you oughta know -- Lorna thinks she's got the clap.

I was too old.
Yes.
Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
You're lying about one thing, Lester.
Shut the door, shut the door!
They get hair all over the place.
Here.
-- you phony asshole --
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
Well, he is.
You're really a love -- you sure?
I thought you said things were great with George.
Five times a day?
How much?
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
Sort of.
-- why?
-- listen, I wonder if you kids could give me a ride? I'm kind of stranded here.
You seem disappointed.
Look, is there somewhere else you'd rather go? Maybe we can change our location.
Are you married?
No of course not.
Good.  I want you to have a good time.
Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?
Who says you ain't supposed to?
Who's Tony?
I don't know.
Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast.
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Well all right.  But really don't make a sound.
Danny?
Red Rum.
Mommy...
Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay?
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think you have anything to worry about.  I'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with Danny.
Tony.
What sort of injury did he have?
No.
How?
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
Good evening.  Forest Service.
Glad to meet you, Winifred.
Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the prettiest.
Don't let it get you down Mrs. Torrance - it's big but it still ain't nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you'll never have to touch.
What'll it be?
It's good to see you.
Perfect for a child.
What do you want me to do about it?
I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had.  It's the most horrible dream I ever had.
You mean just leave the hotel?
I just want to go back to my room.
Stay away...!
Stay away from me!  Please...
Stop it!
Stay... stay away!
Stay away from me.
Give me the bat.
Have any trouble finding us?
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.
The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.
Can I tell you kids something?
Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
There's something else scary.
I've been hearing noises in there.
You got a pilot's license, Marty?
One of the reasons I love you, Marty, is that you're almost as crazy as I am. Please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? Just bright colors. Can you tell the difference?
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did.  He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all.
Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again!
No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.
And don't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come!
But how?
SING!
Well, what about the sex stuff?  What if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow.  Like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it.  Oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay.
How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
Oh, girls.
Oh my! 
He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...
Hurry, Sister!
MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
Mary Clarence, are you with us?
We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.
A cigarette?
So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's?
No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
What?
I don't want to mess anyone up...
A convent?  They put me in a convent? What's the problem?  Wasn't there any more room in Hell?
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
No!  No!  I can't do this!
And the vow of chastity.
Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.
As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
Really catching on.
You may stay.  But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
I was thinking Las Vegas.  Get some butts in those seats.
You sent for me?
But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
What are you doing here?
Then I guess you're stuck.  Life sentence.  No parole.
And if I don't?
Ten flights?
Okay, here's what I want.  I know about this stuff.  A five-star hotel.  With room service.
I really can't talk about it now.  The place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show to do.
I am?
Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.
What're you doing?
It's done?
Right.
I'm telling you, she's not a nun!  Get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes.
I can't see anything in here!
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.
We've got to save her!
Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves our new style.
We can't sing without her!  What should we do?
You mean -- they kidnapped her?
Well, I don't care who she is.  We can't sing without her!
It's so beautiful...
I lied.
But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
She's a nun, Vince.
And who are you to talk?  You were nothing.  You couldn't even sing.  I must have been out of my mind.
She's... she's a nun.
Who took the meat?
Hail, Constable.  How are you?
An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
We must be a curious sight to him.
Keep still, Constable.  You were half-drowned when they found you.
No clotting or gathering of pus.  No healing at all.
It is sacrilege!
I will not allow it.  I will not!
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
Taken.  Taken by the Headless Horseman.  Taken back to hell.
Damn... damn... damn...
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
I manage fine alone.
What is the common thread between these victims?
It's spectacular.
No, I couldn't...
Thank you.
If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way.
Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?
Only the heirs were killed.  Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate.
Did your father take a loan?
I was getting worried.  Who was it?
There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.
What books?
Why... why are you like this?
Climb up!
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?
Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
My God... what has happened?
Returning to the Western Woods?
Where?
It appears well.  It has already clotted.
You cannot kill what is already dead.
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
I don't reckon.
Yeah, they's good all right.
Thank ye.
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
Don't look much like he could. You say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness.
He won't steal. I'm tellin' you he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps to himself.
How 'bout you, Jerry.
Can I help you?
Did you decide, sir?
About a half a mile I think it is.
I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
You know what, by God?
Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would.
He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
We'll go to church and get you baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go on back to bed.
Now here's the deal. Now that I'm gonna throw my entire life away doin' what I want to come live here with y'all, we have to get a few things straight. See, Frank, me and you mama wouldn't have any problems if it wadn't for you. We'd never have a bad word between us. But since you do exist, if I'm gonna be here as the head of the household, we'll have to live by my rules. And my rules are you don't speak unless you're spoken to. Stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does. You're a weird little shit. I don't get you. So wake up. Face what they call reality. We're gonna be a family now. And it's my family. I'll be payin' the bills so you got me. But I ain't your daddy. You just treat me like I am. I'm the boss, okay. And the other thing is your friend Karl has to go. We can't have a normal family with him livin' in the garage and comin' in the bedroom at four in the mornin' with hammers and shit. See?
You like that Vaughan?
Are you sure you can drive? You've really had a lot of alcohol.
On the bass, give it up for Terence "One Ball" Atkins.  On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group.  On drums "The Johnson."  And last and most importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a big hand for these guys. They're workin' their asses off here.  Okay I'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight. To my lovely female companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl - what's your last name Karl?
Don't hit that boy no more.
But maybe just for awhile --
How come?
Are you well?
Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl?
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
How do you know?
How did your mama die?
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine.  Karl, did you really kill somebody?
Will you stay here with us for a long time?
Hey Karl, you off work?
I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a while.
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.
I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it?
And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny.  You know why I want you to play ball with me?
So it died when it come out?
A boy or girl?
That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.
Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for a Mister Turner tomorrow and a closin' up shop early.
I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.
It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you?
It was fun, anyhow.
Can we play ever' Saturday?
Yeah, I guess.
Hey, Karl. How'd you know to come out here?
Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.
Maybe you can make more sense out of them than I can. I made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on Christmas.
Yes sir.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.
Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
That grass out in the yard's all growed up. I figured I might cut it fer ye.
Karl, what in the world are you doing here?
Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.
Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody?
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.
No, I mean your past. About why you were in here.  I'll take you first thing in the mornin'. You have anyplace you can stay tonight at all? I just can't let you stay here. It's the rules. If something happened well, I'd be liable.
She's talkin' about me, Karl. That's my first name.
Karl, you up?
Yeah.
I'll be.
Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
Two fellers was on a bridge a takin' a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water. One of 'em came from Arkansas, I believe.
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.
Yeah.
Yes sir.
Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way.  There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?
Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook.
I don't know why you're so weirded out, this is not San Quentin, it's just a nuthouse. Most of these people don't even know where they are, they're not gonna hurt you.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage.  Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?
I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn't thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade science.
You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. He couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. But, his father made sure that his mother knew what the Bible said. And she made sure Karl knew. You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right?
Where will he go?
It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.
No! At least I don't think I am!
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
And what are you, his chaperone?
So your mother grew up in Shanghai?
And the bookstore? Have you been working there long?
Not an easy book.
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
Looks like someone forgot a camera.
It's yours?
It's kind of overwhelming.
Two, right?
Anything good?
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
I'm all ears.
She probably died.
What do you mean?
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.
What's this?
You don't take anything seriously, do you?
Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
A job?  I definitely wouldn't turn down a job.
What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.
So I can get my job back.
How'd you do out there, Jimmy?
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
I figured he had a right to know.
His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.
Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.
Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.
Benefits?
I'm afraid we'll be working on a strictly freelance basis.
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.
I don't like this. I don't like it one bit.
Aren't you going to say anything?
Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.
You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
The material world is an illusion. It doesn't matter if they're there or not. The world is in my head.
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
Time to wake up.  Hey, kid, time to wake up.  Rashid!  Up and out. I have to work in here. The slumber party is over.
The world is going to end pretty soon if you don't learn fast.  Look, why not make yourself useful? I'm just about out of smokes.  Go around the corner to the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me two tins of Schimmelpenninck Medias. 
Two or three nights.
I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?
I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.
Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?
His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?
Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole. Just like yours.
Fries?
Lettuce and tomato?
$1200 an acre, that's what I paid Ole, won't take a dime less.  You got no choice on that.
But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.
None.
With no bone or scalp or hair present.  Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
Why?  If they could never take title.
It is.
Now, Mister Gi...
Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?
Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
Happy for him.  And relieved.
We discussed that.  And decided not to.
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t...
You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael.  Not once, not ever.  There's no half- way.  As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go.
Your father fought at Belleau Wood, it took him years to get over it.  Nightmares, tears, b...
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
...so when the sheriff returned, you showed him the injury to the deceased's head.
Objection.  Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.
You're a hard man to trust, sir. You sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f...
Well, the freighter.  The twine. The blood.  The knife.  The cup. The watch.  The second battery. The phantom lantern.  The fishing gaff.  The cracked gunnel.  The skull wound.  The blond hair.  That's <u>eleven</u> things...
I should have told everything right away.  I know that now, and I regret it.
You mean, early morning the 16th?
They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery.
I did.  Boy.
It's on the twine, too.  But it's not r...
Tell us why that lantern would be so significant.
We don't let go, you s...
See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.
You gaff with the <u>hook</u> end. Blood's on the butt.  Where your hand goes.
White or black?
You found three batteries, you say.  A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?
No spare.
How <u>is</u> your mother-in-law?
Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around?  Or would both look the same.
Can I say something, here?
Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
Improved...how?
...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
Are these your bags?
Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
Which of you dolls is Daphne?
Upsy-daisy.
No --- how does it go?
Pardon me, Mr. Bienstock - can I have my flask back?
You girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials?
Same faces - same instruments -  - and here's your Valentine's card.
Say, Joe - tonight's the night, isn't it?
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
With me?
You mean it's a girls' band?
It's a hundred miles, Joe - it's snowing - how are we going to get there?
We didn't see anything -  - did we?
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.
Hello, everybody.  I'm the bass fiddle. Just call me Daphne.
When I was a kid, I used to have a dream - I was locked up in this pastry shop overnight - with all kinds of goodies around - jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts -
But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
They don't care - just as long as you wear skirts.  It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.
How can we?  We're broke.
Yeah - let her soak.  Come on.
I'm a push-over for whom?  What is it? Who's on the phone?
Oh, he does!
Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
WHAT?
Jerry!  You can't be serious!
Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
Like when?
Oh.
That's some nerve!
Sugar?
It's all fixed!  Osgood is meeting us on the pier -
Are my seams straight?
Oh - Sugar!
It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -
Why you poor thing - you're trembling all over.
Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
Here you are, Sugar.
Oh, I have some suntan lotion.
What do you think you're doing?
Oh, please do come.  Don't disappoint us. It'll be such fun.  And bring your yacht.
Josephine -
No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
Oh, come on - you can do better than that.
I thought I heard voices - and I just had to talk to somebody.  I don't feel like going to sleep.
Did he get fresh?
I always did.
We could dye our hair.
Yes, I'm holding on.
Yes, indeed.  It's cost my family quite a bit of money.
No - it's showgirls.  I've been married seven or eight times.
Mama is keeping score.  Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
You must be quite a girl.
You're leading again.
This is my friend Josephine - she's going to be a bridesmaid.
Why not?
We'll adopt some.
I don't mean to be forward - but ain't I had the pleasure of meeting you two broads before?
Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?
The wrong shape?  You looking for hunchbacks or something?
No, we couldn't!
We got it second-hand.
Tell what?
If Bienstock catches you again - What's the matter with you, anyway?
You don't say?
Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
Happy days.
Why not?
Well, there they are - more millionaires than you can shake a stick at.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Are you staying at the hotel?
Your view of what?
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
Yeah.  Real hot.
I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
Oh?
Well, I guess I'd better go -
And you will come to hear us tonight?
Well, he's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers.
Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?
Been waiting long?
My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?
What is it?
Look at all that silverware.
Harmless - how?
I don't want to bore you.
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
I got a funny sensation in my toes - like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
Good night.
Oh, no.  I'm off that stuff - for good.
That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.
Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
Oh - that kind of a merger.  Is she young? Pretty?
Oh.  The navigator just came in - we're ready to cast off.
Good evening, sir.
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
PLEASE!
What'll it be, sir?
Well, Spats Colombo - if I were saw one.
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
Perfect. All ginny.
Do you want to come in for a minute? We could talk about--
We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend.  I was fourteen.
Hey.
Wow. You look beautiful.
Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  And Amy wasnt just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.
Just because some slags been paid for, doesnt mean youve got to...you know.
Theres something about him thats just a bit odd.
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
Hey, man.
Seeing you again....
That was a long time ago.
What color are my shoes?
Dont patronize me. Theyve clearly been at this a while.
Mission accomplished.
Well, he looks miserable. What were you talking about?
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macram.
Six thousand, right?
Your friend guaranteed my anonymity.
So...what was I...oh, yeah. Do you honestly think that I want to be single and miserable? That I want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart.
Yes.
Are you asking me if Im gay for pay?
I love that youre asking questions, but do you really want to get into all of this?
Dont stop asking questions, okay?
Dont they have a limit at those machines?
What would you do if you weren't an escort?
Yeah. You?
Youre right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.
I should go.
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You havent visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
Oh, no. He told you.
You pawned it.
Did your mother know you were going to see your father?
Here it is, right here.
Here's one by a man that's very much alive.
Well, how did you like the class, David?
... So me and Sounder, ran right by the men that was the prisoners, and crawled under the fence! That's when I cut my hand on the glass. It hurt like mad! But I kept runnin', and then I didn't feel no more hurtin' till I stopped runnin'!  Why was that, Miss Johnson?
He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.  Come on, tell me...
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
:...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...
:...THE CHANCE TO SOAR IN THE DIM BLUE AIR ABOVE SMOKE IS TO THEIR...
But, Charlie --
I see you found what you was lookin' for.
If anybody's to blame, it's me -- I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.
He beat you, too, Daddy, and you had a big ol' shootin' rifle.
Readin' must be somethin' powerful, huh, son?
Mama is outside with Josie Mae and Earl.
And me too, son! You shore done got to be such a big little man!
Daddy, when is we goin' huntin'?
Wheeew! This is some hard work, but it beats goin' to jail.
You just came back home, Daddy. I don't wanna leave right now -- I wanna stay home and be with you.
You know somethin', Daddy?
What's your daddy's name?
Mister, can you visit anybody here?
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
He eats all right -- his throat ain't scarred.
He will... Come on, git down and act like a possum.
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
Can't sleep?
Good night, Mama...
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
So when I left, she gave me these books.
It's about the Three Musketeers.
You know where my father is, don't you, Miss Boatwright?
But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
Well, let me have it.
Mama, why did they take Daddy away?
Mama, what was we laughin' for?
Rebecca, you jest the one I wanta see.
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--
There, you see?
Howya do, Rebecca. I sorta been expectin' you this mornin'.
I wish I could, Rebecca, but I can't let you.
It's the rules and I gotta follow 'em. No visitin' 'cept holidays and Sunday -- and no womenfolk anytime.
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble.
What... are you?
Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to get Wendy to like me.
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
Patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip...
Don't worry about that. Now, I want you to say 'Doggy.'
Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'
-no Cheesy Poofs.
What?
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
Dude, this is seriously lame. I didn't know we were gonna get all dirty and stuff.
Ze alarms! Zey went off!
Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that good anyway.
How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking?
Dude, how can you hate the environment?
Who the hell made up that law?!
Hey Cartman.
Come on, just get to the message board!
Mph rmpmh rm.
Mph rm rmph!!
I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny!
Goodnight, honey.
I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh?
Eric?! Eric, what is it?!
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think?
Thank God, that sucked ass.
Wendy, Mkay, if you want to start getting political, I'll throw your skinny little butt right back into rehab. Mkay?
WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!
MMMMMPHPHPHPHP!!!!!
Kyle, you take your little brother out to play with you!
Terrance and Phillip, you are under arrest for working in America without the proper documents! WE GOT YOU!
Guess.
So... We must free more Canadian prizoners?
That's gonna take a long time!
What's a butfor?
It's okay, I am done for.
OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!
Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
It's only a matter of time before my mom has HIM burned too!
I don't know. But it has gone far enough! I'm sick of it!  <b>Something must be done! Change has got to come around! They're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of chains and ties and glue! We have to fight before they've taken every one! Something must be done!</b>
Okay... I just need to find a few private message boards...
Shiteater-
We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
I'm needing lunch.
I am the dark master!
SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!
Yes... And in doing so, you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming.
But I-
Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I just got a letter!
You'd fuck your uncle!
Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.
Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!
You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!
Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off!!
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
Who's my cream puff?
Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!
What did you do today Satan?
Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!
Well I just want you to be impressed with what I <u>do</u>. I want you to respect my MIND.
What if I just left?
No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't just renege on a deal. That's lying.
Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?!  You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
Ow, you're hurting me!
Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut!
We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
Hi Wendy.
Got it.
Will you two please stop it!  I don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!
Oh yeah...
So...
No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.
Weren't you down in the dining room?
On channel 10?
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
So, are you on for the next one?
You want to go back to shuttle work?
You gotta think of your old age.
I think I can handle it.
If anyone can hear me please respond!
The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there?
It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel!
I don't know what you're talking about!
Barnes?
Well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation?
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.
It's getting hard to breathe...
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
Really?
What are we going to do?
Damn it.  If only we could get to those suits... Dawn then thinks of something -
And suppose you couldn't hold out?
He certainly is polite.
Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.
Do you want some advice?
Oh my God.  What happened?
A little dab'll do ya. Now you know how to get there, right?
And what are you going to do?!
Dawn.  Come in.
Uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now I'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.
I would, but no one can perform the ceremony.  I guess it doesn't matter.
In that case, I accept.
Where's Taylor?
I'm homesick.
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
I haven't quite made up my mind yet.
What the hell is that?
Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
Now Mac, can you tell me the status of this deck?
Mac, what about the suit compartments on this level?  Can they be accessed?
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
After we ID, we bury the body. Case and casket closed.
Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Think he bought it?
The Faz sure took care a her.  Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to suppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him. Sid and Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid.
Yeah, and make it extra muddy, I didn't sleep a zee last night. Sheila fills a cup. Buzz lifts it to his mouth, his hands trembling.
And look at that; both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz.
Theo.
Watch out for that one. She's got a great average, but she's looking for a prince. And, believe me, she's 
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
It could just as easily have been me in that box.
What about bowling?
You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
My poor baby!
Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
Who's there!
What did you do to Buzz?
Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other.
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
Dad, this is ridiculous. Just open it.
You're just like you mother! Always jealous!
Leave him alone!
Get that outta your mouth!
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
Do I want you?
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?
I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.
What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
Come on Theo, what about plan C?
Do you talk with your mom?
How much would you charge me for the lips?
Come on, bargain with me.
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
Then it's true, isn't it? About...
It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it?
I can't tell you, Theo.
These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.
You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?
Say something, Theo. Give me something. A doll's legs catch fire. Theo stares into Sheila's eyes.
Very professional.
Lips still for sale?
Lane's closed big fellah, league night.
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
Who identified the body?
The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears.
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
Nice work, Captain sir.
Thirty yards.
What have you been told so far?
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.
Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.
Harry's missing.
Sir, if the subs haven't left by now...
Norman, get out of there now! Norman?
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
Not now, Beth.  Please.  I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking.  Where's Edmunds?
Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
What <u>about</u> a crowbar?
How can he be missing?
Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
We have a library?
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
In Edmunds' things.
You said something to him, didn't you?
Forget the sub.
Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --
Four days?
The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?
Page 87.
"Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids...
He translated it wrong.
When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.
Nothing about drowsiness.
Riordan?
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
What's that?
What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
What is it, Norman?
What's wrong, Norman?
Did you?
He can't manifest.
Don't, Beth.
This is what I'm talking about, Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you. This vindictiveness.  This rage.
Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else.  You want to blame Beth.  Because you hate Beth.
He doesn't wait for an answer.
Then what is it?
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.
How are you feeling, Norman?
And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.
It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.
Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?
Norman?
Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it --
Wisconsin's your answer.
It's the squid!  Stop it!
We're never gonna make it.
I can't reach her.
Push her, c'mon.
You know how to work this thing?
Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.
There is one possibility.
All the facts you need are right in front of you.
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.
How are the others?
No other equipment?  Scientific instruments?
I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while.  I treat aircrash survivors.
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.
He wasn't feeling well.
Squint harder.
Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?
Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.
Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel.  Who's in charge then?
Kid, you take the glory and the good intentions and I'll take the reward.
We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.
Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.
Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?
But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?
But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.
The Kiber Crystal.
Blue Five, does that glare bother you?
No reply on any circuits... It's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew.  It's not close enough to identify.
Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.
Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.
I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.
I found it... It's just not there.
Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.
This isn't going to work.
Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...
Get to the ship!
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.
Let him have it.  You're winning anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.
Holy Maker, Threepio.  I forgot...
Mr. Barcalow, save power, don't waste it on workers... Ace, tell Aardvark we're on our way...
Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
You always told me you couldn't do human...
Are you alright ?
Johnny, this is Zander.
It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate.
I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...
How do you feel about him now ?
I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !
Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
Isn't it great to be in love ?
None at all... We won.
Johnny Rico, you're jealous !
He's nothing like you.
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
I love you, Carmen.
I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?
Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?
What's wrong with you ?
Johnny...! I thought you were dead !
Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.
Plasma, ma'am... from the planet.
Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.
Report.
Where'd it come from ?
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
What ?
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
What frequency ?
Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach !
Mr. Rasczak.
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am !
Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
You got something to say about the Mobile Infantery ?
Alright, we're gonna carry you...
Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
Where is Lt. Ilia?
The Creator is that which created V'ger.
Disclose the information.
A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?
'To learn all that is learnable.'
It is a courier, Captain. Grade One priority. Non-belligerency confirmed.
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
Programming ready?
And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...  ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.
Exactly.  And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
Time to impact...?
Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!
Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary...
Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
Reporting as ordered, Captain.
Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy absenting himself from this interview.
Recommend we proceede, Captain.
Have you been able to analyze <U>any</U> of this...?
What should you have known?
The orbiting devices would be controlled from the point, then...?
Not for us?
Spock, we <U>were</U> its answer!
Starfleet has been apprised of our situation, Captain.
Evening, Annie.
Mom's expecting you for dinner tonight.
Go you Huskies?
Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.
Could you tell me when's the next train?
No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.
You get what you pay for.
That: in an act of...
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
Well.  It was a pleasure meeting you.
So that the Old Mill, the Old <u>Mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too...
I don't mean to impose, but...do you think we might...
Hi.
How can you <u>say</u> that?
I...
No, I don't...
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
Uh huh.
"Rise, one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice."
Fix my glasses.
Great.  Who is it...?
Thank you.
Later on.
You can do it.
What's the scene...
Ah.  Ah.  Ah...
...he stuck a fishhook in it. 
Because it's about <u>purity</u>...
Yessuh.  Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years.
Would you like to <u>see</u> it?  I've got the key back at my store...
Best way I know to get ink on your hands.
Good morning.
To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
What are you going to do?
I'll wait for you...I'm proud of you. I'll <u>be</u> waiting.
"The mill grinds the grain, but the grain is not destroyed.  <u>Although</u> it is altered..."
It's all over between us.  I've found someone else.
Maude, this <u>man</u> wrote this <u>play</u>!
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?
They're holding it for ransom.
What's an Associate Producer credit?
Wat...
Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
<u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America.
...why am I here...?
Waterford, Vermont.
Because, because...we don't <u>have</u> to build an Old Mill -- they <u>have</u> an Old Mill -- <u>yeah</u>.  It's on a stream -- that's where you <u>put</u> a mill.
It's Marty on the Coast -
That makes a <u>lot</u> of sense, Claire, that makes a lot of...list...listen, cause the audience isn't <u>coming</u> to see your breasts.  They are coming to see you <u>act</u>. What are you doing this evening...?
What do you drink?
Nice town that you've got here.
What else?
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
You do...?
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
It's a formality.  Any case of damage to city prop...you hit the control box of the new stop light, and...  They'll, uh, these things <u>happen</u>, I hope you're alright, and that you're feeling...
Izzat so?
I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
Get him on the phone.
I want you to hear this.
I love Jewish men.
This is Joe White.
What, what's there to <u>think</u> about?  The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
You can't do what?
<u>Forget</u> the contract.  Claire.  What is it?
I know that...
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
...I know...I know...
And you know what...?
I, uh...  I've always thought so...  Well, you just get an idea, and try to find the best way to express it in pictorial form.  I've written a letter to the studio and to SAG protesting...  Bill: get a copy of that letter...!  I just wanted to tell you that I am <u>past</u> chagrined, I'm <u>mortified</u> at the way you were spoken to...
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
Kiss my ass.
Aren't you supposed to set an example for people...?
Arrest him.
She was in the car with Bob Barrenger last night.  And she was injured coming home from a love tryst, so...
Moral turp...you're on my home court, friend, I have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I got rape, I got collusion...
Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
I...
And what was it you wanted to say?
I had a witness I would.
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
Town's out of lilacs.
...totally false...<u>totally</u> false.  He is the, I would say the most responsible human being I have ever...
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
I can't.
How do you know you saw it?
I was walking down the street...I remember, I was writing a...
Did you bring Bob's weights?
I'm gonna' bring it off.
<u>Stop</u>...
It's just a formality.
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU HEAR ME?
We got the permit.
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
Wally...?
Do something.
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
Well, these things happen.  <u>Purpose</u> of my call, my wife wanted to know what brand of <u>cigarettes</u> Mr. Barrenger smokes, so she could lay some out tonight...we got the list of his dietary <u>requirements</u>...
Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.
...the damn thing...
He's going to <u>get</u> that calf.
"Assembly of Death" did 95 million dollars the first weekend.
Where are we?
Why?
&quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot;
So what's up?  Who's marrying who <u>this</u> time?
...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red and Blue make purple.
<u>Never</u> say 'never' -- it's <u>not</u> fair to say 'always' -- and <u>no</u> name calling. Use your words.
I didn't say that.  Why would I say that?
I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
I'm gonna call him.
Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
Look she's upset --
Wow.  Who's that for?
And don't tell her I told you.
Actually.  I could only help him.
You don't like his friends.
This'll work, huh?
Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.
Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.
You lost Ben?!
I'm gonna beep daddy at work.
You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did you remember my egg carton?  I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today.
Lunch time Sleeping Beauty.  Where's Ben?  Is he in the bathroom?
She still packing for her trip?
You know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me <u>now</u>?  In front of the whole <u>world</u>? Frosty, the Snow Bitch!!
You think this is funny?
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
I <u>did</u> what she said.  I <u>used</u> my words, I <u>told</u> him what I <u>felt</u>, and they...
And you<u>don't</u> tell her.  What you're going to say.
Put down that <u>goddamn</u> camera!
You touched it.
...for Christmas, okay?  Every magician needs a white dove, a <u>real</u> one, they <u>do</u>!
IS THAT YOU?
I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together.  <u>Hate</u>.
Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.
Mommy?
ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD <u>SUFFOCATE</u> IN THERE!!!
So you're okay.
Ben!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now stop climbing!  Ben listen to me...
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
Okay.  These are good.
I've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie.  And I'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar...
The world.  <u>Thinks</u> I'm gone.  But only the magician.  Knows better.
And when did that pass?
May I remind you that Duncan has the <u>client</u> arriving at exac...
People beat it, don't they?  All the time.
Congratulations.  Only forty minutes late.  You're handling this promotion really well Rachel.
You're making a <u>career</u> decision here, I would <u>strongly</u> sugg...
You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!
Planning on getting --
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
Just outside the big top, we're almo...
You know the kids aren't really in danger.  This is about Rachel, and you're right, I'm disappointed in her learning curve, and...
I grew up, a little.  I'm ready for a life that's built around commitm...
What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you?
Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.
Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?
Get out!
I need practice.
However many.  It's not enough.
What about obsessively picking her split ends?
You feeling all right?
My boss.
Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you <u>do</u> get to smoke dope.
And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.
She hasn't mentioned this.
Oh, my God.
I really look like shit.
I'm thinking.  Do I know you well enough to really chew you out?
Actually.  They'll want Annabelle's mother.
You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
You put filth in my child's mouth.
You taught my child that I am some limp dick <u>loser</u>.  Who didn't <u>care</u> about her pain.
See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth.
She likes a Stolie, no ice.
You're lying.
Everything.  You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
Anyway, I thought...while I'm gone...maybe I'll hire in some help.
Look.  I know they hate me.
And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
What a great surpri...
'...I don't know if I can make it.' That's what I said.  But I didn't leave.
We make our lives, one step at a time.  We do the best we can.  The truth about the future?  A promise. Is only a hope.
Out! Leave the table!
Well, I'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for homework. The movie's like almost four hours. And then I'm supposed to write a report on survivors.  You know any survivors, Dad?
There's something I need to talk about with you.
Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor.
Welcome to the show, Scooby.
Nice to have you here.
And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
Consuelo?
Really? How many?
Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
Hmmm.  But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
Who is Jesus?
Oh. How did it happen?
How did they execute him?
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
No, you don't.
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
Marty...
Sure!...
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
So you don't want to hear my new ending?
What do you want?
Marcus...You'll write something better next time!
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch Catherine.
Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
I think Scooby's like a lot of kids. He just hit aa speed bump. Now he's gonna find his way, his path is gonna be cleared, and I think he's gonna continue his education at a good college. And everybody else is gonna be happy.
Get the hell outta here!
Whaddya wanna talk about?
Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...
Ni...
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
Great!
So what's going on?
But...you called.
Doubt it.
Whoopee.
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
We got trouble.  That bodyguard son- of-a-bitch has them running all over the field--just took out three on the north end!
Is he with the girl?
I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
--be prepared.
Let's move it we got company!
I'm going first.  Taking the fire. If we go out together we're all dead!
What about rule one:  never let the person you are protecting out of your sight!
I have a lighter!
How's the arm?
That's it!  Up ahead!
What about Cooper--where is he?
Who's Ryan Cooper?
I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...
Good.
My crew is going to work alongside with your men, don't worry--we're a team!
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
Can I have a glass of water?
I have your word, Mister President?
But, finally, one factor tipped the scales. We received information from a very re- liable source that your country was going to build one.
The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
Yes?
Do you mean to say you'd set it off in your own country?
Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off.  Why should they?
What are you talking about, Major?
Now, snap out of it, fella!
You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
What about the President?
I'm sorry, sir.  General Schmuck is asleep and he isn't taking calls until eight-thirty.
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.
Yes!
Well, that's ridiculous.  If the teleprinter and radio links are out of order, just pick up a phone and pay for a call.
Well, Mister President.
You aren't sure!
Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.
Major, that's all I've been told.  Just got it on the red phone.  The base is to be sealed tight.  And I mean tight.
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
That is correct, Major.
But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
I suppose we might catch them off their guard.
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
Where, sir?
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
Right.
I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
And you'd like to see that?
Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
But he'll hear everything we're saying.  And if he just looks out of that window, he'll see everything we're doing. 
I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.
General Schmuck, are you positive of your figures?
Look, he's there, and you're here.
Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense, when its course and target are known?
General, stick to the point, please.
You've lied to me twice - I'm sorry, but it will be strictly routine.  These men are experts.
Roger, maintain.
What else could it be?
Check.
Missiles!  Sixty miles off, heading in fast.  Steady track, they look like beam riders.
Twenty!  Twelve o' clock.
Well, listen, King.  Could you take her up to about eight hundred?  That'll help you come in at a nice down-angle, and it'll give us a chance for our chutes to open.
So am I.
Where'd they get you?
What's your point, Lothar?
Yes, Major.
What happened?
Lieutenant Zogg, what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission?
Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.
Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???
First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.
I'm okay.  What's up?
Maybe the warning system's out.
I asked you a question, Lothar!
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
I thought I'd go along for the ride.
Sure, King.
Can I have some?
How long were you in there?
You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.
That was really great.
Yeah!
Responsibility, progress.
No I quit.
Yup.
Yeah.
Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
No, I'm here. Where are you?
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.
You said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. What guy?
It's your birthday?
I don't know. Later. I don't know.
You know what we should do? Go to the...
No. Life is too short.
Hey, you know me.
I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...
Oh, and guess who showed up.
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
What she doin' in the van, man?
Bullshit.
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there!  Hey... Not dead! Definitely not dead!
God, Tim lied to your ass, man. That guy's sad, man. Well, uh, I gotta go, but, uh, listen, if I don't come back, I'll send a video of me surfing. Alright, man? Get some rest. Go with the flow.
Fuck her! Come on, let's go.
Yeah.
Hey, come on, man! Limo!
Pony? What's a "pony"? You mean that geek who played the folk music at the senior prom? What's that guy's name? Neil Moynihan?
Hey, man.
Your his publicist?
What do you mean? His girlfriend?
Yes! Free concert!
Hey! Hey.
You stand someplace else, man. You stand someplace else. This is our corner. You don't fucking own it!
It's okay.
You're a drunk and an idiot.
No, but I heard it was great.
So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?
Yeah, we're all above that.
Whoa!
You make videos?
You could do it.
I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do you have a reel?
Yeah!
Thanks, man!
Come on. Inside.
Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
Hi.
Can you tell me what happened?
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
Yeah, yeah, I stay at the Four Seas, it's ease.
I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib.
They let you out?
You lied to me.
Yes.
You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.
I don't know.
Jeff, stay there.
You know, this, what you're doing with your life...
Your sure as hell right about that.
"The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you.
Oh, well, then you better listen to him.
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?
Yes, you asshole.
Jeff. Jeff.
Come with me.
New ground?
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should.
No, I don't.
Come on.
Oh, yeah?
Wait, away?
To his hotel?
You're unbelievable.
You did, huh? Good for you.
Go.
So you think I should?
For a while.
So who are you?
Well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
W-wait a minute, wait a minute.
No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know.
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
So? What's L.A. like?
Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?
Soon.
You know, my mom has this saying.
About where she went. I mean, what bar?
Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to.
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
No, see, Neil, if you're fucking with one of my friends, then you're fucking with me.
What are you going to do? Hm?
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
Yes, that's right. You know what, honey? You should go to New York. You should go. Go show 'em. They need your unique point of view.
Leave him alone, Tim.
Could you give me a ride?
I can't believe your grandparents never come down here.
Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?!
NO-GAH-BUH- NO!  Rule number two - NO NAMES!  NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard!
Can you guys believe this?  We're like celebrities!
Another sex dream?
...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --
Use the bathroom, because the Port-a Potties on the field are gross.
Hello?
Thanks, Cleo.  See you tomorrow.
But, we have to make a smart plan!
So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
I know, but that was before.
I never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch.  Baby, we are living the great American Dream!
I'm sorry.
Nope.  Sounds more like the first.
NO!  Wait...um...  We're the A-squad from Lincoln High? So, uh...
Hey.  Eyes on your own belly!
Don't use big bills!
Yeah?
No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.
Ammo?
... Ja-ck B-ar-t-le-tt... Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
She did, did she?  How is the old girl?
Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone.  Promise!
I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
I mean it.  I'm in.  This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that I've ever had.  If one of us needs something, we all do.
What the hell do you want?
Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou?
Sure, this'll go on all night.
Perhaps the reason I hated Bases Loaded is that I knew your name. I'd always heard you had some talent.
I had a teacher like that once.
It's not your career -- it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal.  I don't want to be a reader all my life.  I want to write.
You sure have.
I mean it.  It's no good to me anyway.  Help yourself.
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
So do I.
Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
Who's Norma?
That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?
What happened?
Hello, Betty.
Her own movie theatre.
All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.
Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.
Hello, young fellow.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
That's what I want to talk to you about.
Or shall I call my servant?
You're a writer, you said.
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
Well?
You know, I'm pretty expensive. I get five hundred a week.
Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
Cut away from me?
I want to talk to you for a minute.
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.
All padding.  Don't let it fool you.
You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.
The other guests?
Hold me tighter.
You think this is all very funny.
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
Go away.
How did it go?
I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive.
No, you're not.  Max! Max!
That's between you and yourself, Norma.
That's a lie!  They still want me!
That's what I told them.
How come?
You send them.  Is that it, Max?
No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
Mr. Gillis, if you please.
We've come for the car.
Relax, fans.  The car isn't here.
You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.
All right, Gillis.  You've got five minutes.  What's your story about?
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars.  Only I'm not going to.
What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other people come second.
But the Power Source, Zaltar.
But what will happen?
It must be the girls. One of the girls.
Bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. OK?
I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?
A Storm Dragon?
Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.
I don't feel like it right now.
Wait...don't leave me in here...
Like it?
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
And now?
Wait. Don't leave me.
And you can see how you feel about me, right?
Hey! Ethan!
They think I have a concussion.
No!
You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
Guess! Go on.
You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?
Do you have any theories about last night?
Yes.
I can't help it if men notice me.
Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in outer space. And we're in inner space.
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
Your hair looks the same.
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
Don't you believe in knocking?
No plans for the weekend, Linda?
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that?
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
Shouldnt've done that.
That horrible woman!
There is a way.
But it's impossible.
Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
Yes, mustn't stop.
Zaltar. Use the wand!
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
Brad?
Hiya, sweet thing.  Little guy's getting' hassled, huh?  Kent, you still here?
I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
You look wonderful.
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this.  It really isn't easy.
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
You...um...you never got married?
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
I just can't stand this.
Me??
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
Peanut butter and jelly.
That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there --  on a Wheat King thresher.  Do you think I could do it? Do you?
The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that.
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
I guess he misses a lot of dinners.
Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White, I don't mean to interrupt but ---
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
-- but you  deserve the vacation, Lois.
Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?
Keep talking to that state trooper so he doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
A television set?
Sonofagun! Look at this here!
Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'?
Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
Please, Mr. Webster, you're a great humanitarian. Ain't you heard what it's like in them jails? You send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and...
I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...
Hey, boss.
Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
He sure wasn't actin' bad and nasty that day in Smallville. Man, he was so full of niceness I was startin' to feel funny about layin' that chunk of...
A computer.
Stone mutha.
Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
No, we're just going down.
Whatcha wanna stop here for?  Not that I ain't glad to be on the ground, y'understand.
Who is she?
He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.  Well, this was only the biggest day of his life. I really don't know how to thank you.
It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:
The picture looks blurry.
Lots of things...
I'll do more than tell you. I'll show you, back at my place. If you'll just do me one little favor first.
I don't kiss.
Computers talk to other computers, right?
She's not his mama either.
Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
Lois, I usually do.
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.
Actually, yes.
Maybe I could try --
I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements.  Sleeping arrangements.
Where were you?
I didn't think I wanted to.
"They?"
. . . Superman?. . . . .
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
But . . ..that's terrible!
This way Lex.
Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet on an East-West trajectory?
Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --
And she -- the one you have chosen -- she feels as much for you?
-- as the keeper of the archives of Krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.
For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as "criminals."
DELETE IN CUTTING
No, Jor-El, the baseball player that came from Porto Rico. Yes Jor-El your Jailer.
It must be tough, having to be Clark Kent.
Perhaps there is some good in you after all, Lex Luthor.
I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor. A lying weasel like you couldn't resist the chance . . .
Which one would you like to join, Luthor? Pick a hole.
What more?
No drinks . No movie. This is the last time I take a charter flight.
Put down Lex Luthor !
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..
He's captured Non!
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
They make my eyes itch.
I've never been in a place like this before.
Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds.
Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?
You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
'Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?'
Superman? Has something happened to him?
It must have been a super effort to get out of bed, Clark.
Would you mind taking a walk with me?
Yes, darling?
I think there's an angle.
I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.
And your heart beats faster just thinking about him.
Are we going to skip the country, Uncle Lex?
. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
The one Superman wrecked up?
Hey! Just remember I made you.
You think he'll find us.
What I need this for?
I hadn't counted on this but . . .  . . . of course - the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat. I am a ...
Destroy Superman!
Look closely at his cell structure. See anything familiar?
I'm not going anywhere.
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?
I know, but  --
You'd better get a new alarm clock. The chief has been hollering for you.
Mom...
Your bookie?
I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.
It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois.
Big night coming up?
What'd you call him?
Is that what they're calling him?
Besides that.
What can I tell you? He's my leader.
This??
Nuts. He made it.
Some people can read 'War and Peace' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story. Other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe.  Y'know.
See?
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
What do you suggest, my dear?
This all has something to do with Superman, doesn't it?
Oh. Why? does he live up here?
But you can't ignore these facts!  It's suicide!  Worse than that, it's genocide.
How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota, and just now orphaned.  Poor thing.
I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton
Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
Oh, dear. That isn't what I --
It's the only logical conclusion. If he remains here, he'll be as dead as...
....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -
Lois, take Kent there and introduce him around
Do as I say. Let go!
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
Well...flashlight?
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
Oh.
Is it true you're impervious to pain?
I...uh...
It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer.
It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it?  Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have  --
Still, foolishly, perhaps, I had a theory that eliminates the Presidential push-button.  I was doing my homework...
Yes, we do know each other.  I'm Alison Jones.
Yes.
I'm just fine, Ally.  What about you?
And what does he do again?
Ally Jones.
Which one?
What...does it turn to?
I...don't think so.
Alison.
I hope she gets better.
My name is...
I understand.
I can help you.
Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help.
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
I don't know.
No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.
How is Nicole?  Is she around?
I don't see how that concerns you, Billy.
Well, it being so depressing and all.  But it's reality.  You can't just turn this off because you happen to think it's a bad idea.
I've tried to stay out of it.  But it turns out that's not so easy, Sam.  You've gone and got yourself this lawyer.  Mitchell Stephens. You and Risa and Wendell and the Ottos.
Have you been waiting long?
Does this mean I can't take a shower?
What are you thinking?
I mean, the way they look.  Their hair and clothing...
That's the way I thought of them sometimes.
A strange little fellow, but you couldn't help liking him.  He was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six.
What do you mean?
I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened.  That's how I remembered it.  But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty.  Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then?
It's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event.
You heard what Abbott said?
That's what he said, is it?
Good morning, Wanda.  Hi, Hartley.
What do you think?
Away from your crazy Mom.
But Dolores said she saw a dog and tried to...
And winter?
Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey?  Want me to fix you something?
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
Is he coming over now?  Right away?
The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty...
What's vermin again?
Nicole?
Yes.
I don't like thinking about the accident.  I don't even remember it happening.  Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and...
You can only feel lucky that you didn't die for so long.  Then you start to feel...unlucky.
They work for the people we're trying to sue.  Their job is to try to minimize damages.  Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs.  No good guys or bad guys.  Just our side and their side.
Dolores.
It was snowing.
Note my objection.  She said, 'As I'm talking.'
That's the local bar?
Is this it?
Here we go.
I'm in a car wash.
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
Oh God, I'm scared.
We do.
I'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this, Mrs. Otto, but the Walkers said you would understand.  I know it's an awful time, but it's important that we talk.
Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.
Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best?
If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement.
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
No.
Yes.
You are?
You're going to blow everyone away.
What's that?
That's too high.  I'll never reach it.
Are you sleeping?
Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse.  I thought I'd take you over.
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.
Where are we running?  What am I missing here?
Excuse me, Steve.  I said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.
I still think he's responsible for the smear.
Went over to Philly yesterday an' seen the folks...it's nice you send them the fifty a month...
I see Bartha gave you cold tongue for supper.  Hey, wait a minute!
You don't know that lunatic yet? Whims - egotistic whims!  Like the gag - when you got him for a friend, you don't need an enemy!  That's what the fight with Bartha was about. "Leo", I says, "Hunsecker froze me out.  So I'm eating humble pie this month - please print me an item."
Well, son, looks like you went out and bought yourself a packet of trouble...
Take it easy, Susie.  He wouldn't be much of a man if he didn't understand my concern.  Would you, son?
I don't take kindly to you and Falco selling me ethics.  Who's the injured party here, you?
Sidney is a liar!
Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
Susie likes to keep her girlish secrets.  But in her heart of hearts I imagine, Dallas, that she fancies you in an uncommon way. Now, what about YOU, son?  Not just tom-catting around...I hope?
No!  NO!  Don't touch me!
I just checked "downtown".  Quiet everywhere tonight.
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
No, lemme finish.  I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB!  That boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head.  And Susan, like you said, she's growing up.  Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!
I'll do it, J.J. - don't get me wrong - in for a penny, in for a pound.  I'll see it through, but stop beating me around the head. Let me make a living!
How?
But it's too late.  I got him back the job...
Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!
Let's forget cats and dogs and other pseudo-literary remarks--- I'll just lay it on the line!  What about that big rumpus in my office today?  You were there, Frank! Where, according to St. Dallas, J.J. was responsible for the Elwell smear!
J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.
Listen with care - this will cost me everything, so you know I'm telling you the truth!
I know...I know you're the strongest cop in town.
What's all the rush?  You said three o'clock.
I thought he would.
I don't think so.
We're old friends, Chickie - quit it!  A big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter!  What did you think would happen in his house?
Do you think you could do something, Sidney?
This sort of thing!
A girl needs a little romancing before she -
What would you think of me if -
Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.
Yes, but as a new subscriber you're under no obligation to take more than three books.  And if you mail the enclosed card within ten days --
Did you send my folks in Philly the check...?
I swear, Sidney, I can't help it - sometimes I wonder what I see in you...
Where's those glossy prints you promised?  Tonight's the latest I can place them -
Why me...?
Feels like a Monday night, don't it...?
Where do you come off to make a remark like that?
And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.
Jimmy!  This is a coincidence.  I am just going -
Steve, my brother isn't as bad as he's painted.  He isn't perfect, but -
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
I have a message for you; I love you.  May I dedicate the next number to you?...And the next, and the next. Every Sunday I'll buy you a new bonnet -
Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you...  Will you forgive me?  Have I lost you, Steve?  Have I...?
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.
You going to work all day?
Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a hangover.  Meet the pilot.
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
Yeah?  Who sent you?
What does that mean?
I'm right here.  I'm fine.  What's the dog's name?
I need a minute here, okay?  You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?
You have to do what I say?!
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!
Everything.
Affirmative.
Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.
Excellent.
Torque wrench please.
Alriight!!  My man!
We don't have much time.
No!
So she's pretty cool, huh?
We're better off by ourselves.
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
Yeah.  Right.  How were you supposed to know? Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons.  Did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man?  Colt, Browning, Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men.  Men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up.  You're so creative.  You don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life.  To feel it growing inside you.  All you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.
I know!
It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?
Can it be destroyed?
You look like handmade shit.
My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
I have detailed files.
It's finally over.
Where do you stand on all this?
What does he mean, too correct?
Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major Arnold. Sir.
I guess you admire musicians.
You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated?
Isn't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor's baton, isn't that true?
Can I ask you a favour, Major?
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
Think you can get me any of that?
Mine's the Eleventh.
Of course.
I can't do this. It's not right.
I want you to understand why you're here. You're automatically banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24. We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission. You understand that?
I made no deal!
Why were they going to arrest you?
I've got to hand it to the British, David. You know what those guys are?  Decent.  Tell me, Herr Dr. Furtwngler, do you know Hans Hinkel?
When I last saw you, I was unprepared. I did not know what to expect. In these past weeks, I have been thinking more carefully and making some notes.  You have to understand who I am and what I am. I am a musician and I believe in music. I am an artist and I believe in art. Art in general, and music, in particular, has for me mystical powers which nurture man's spiritual needs. I must confess, however, to being extremely naive.  I insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics. My entire life was devoted to music because, and this is very important, because I thought that I could, through music, do something practical.
You won't find it because no such telegram exists.
Then you are wrong.
have no idea what ordinary people thought.
Yes, I know who he is.
Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.
Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?
I have illegitimate children.
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
It's Dr. Furtwngler's baton, which I stole.
What?
Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery.
Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwngler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.
You were in insurance before the war.
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
Dr. Furtwngler is a great musician. He actively opposed the Nazis and later on he helped many Jews to escape.
It was Beethoven's Ninth.
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.
Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be?
I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.
Alright, the beige one.
That bum.  So what if he has a Porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's Friday night for crissakes.
Compared to me she is.  How come you're not at the cash anymore?  They catch ya steal- ing?
So, it's from the future, is that right?
There's so much...
I caught one, back there.
We gotta get you to a doctor.
Stop!  I don't want to know. Hold still.  So...it was John that ordered you here?
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.
Bag some Z's?
Not possible.
Don't say that.
It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.
And so you feel nothing.
I don't think I like this.
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go.
Why were the other two women killed?
Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.
Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal--
I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not "stepping down."  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares.
I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
Do you know what to do?
This can't be real...
This is nuts.
See you around.
That's classic.
The maitre d' called you Christine.
I have a confession to make.  Someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you, as a practical joke.
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.
Do you mind if I sit?
I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.
Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.
What are you doing... ?
That's a lie...
I don't know.  A lot.
It could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank.
What the fuck are you... ?
Nicholas...
No!  You take another step, I'll shoot!  They're trying to kill me...
Hi.  Didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
Originally, Connecticut.
Julliard, yeah.
Yes.
Hey there, Nickie.
Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
Really?
It's a profound life experience.
Tell me you'll call.
What are you doing?
What have they been doing to you?
The phone's dead.
Do you know how to change a tire?
Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...
I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry!  How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?
You know... how'd you manage the gun? I mean...
Yes.
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?
How much is it?  A few thousand, at least.  A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it.
We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
Oh... it's a game.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Get rid of them.
Drive in.
I need the police.
Thank you.
Dinner's in the oven.
You did?  How is he?
Is everything alright?
Mr. Van Orton... ?
All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
What's the trouble?
Invitations: the Museum Gala.
Your ex-wife.
What the fuck... ?!
I wasn't expecting you.
Attractive...
Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
I only saw Theo drive up.
I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.
You're not telling us something.
Hey!  I heard screaming...
You used the wrong test.
Malcolm, this is essential work I'm doing.  Just think what my research can do for education. Elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports, where loud noise is random; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read.
No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
I, I just can't...
Eleanor, how was the drive?
And then what happened?
It was a stupid thing to do.
Someone is playing with you.
I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance.  Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell.  A communal story.  Someone starts it.  Then we all add a little more to it. And then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it.  This story shapes what we see and hear.  We interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. I started our story when I gave you the history of Hill House. You've added to it.  That's what this experiment has all been about.  That's what it was about, the experiment's over.  I'm pulling the plug.  This is my fault.
But you told me to look in the paper!  You told me I'd be perfect!
Come on.
This is where we're going?
What happened?
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
What do you do?
You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?
If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.
David?
Theo... Did you?
Why?
I'll take that as a compliment.  In the city, what kind of place do you live in?
Adhara.  I told your father, if you're looking for a name, you can't go wrong with a constellation.
Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
I like the colors.
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
We think someone is here.
How they goin', kid?
Same as last time -- the rest after.
When you find the guy, you'll know.
See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops?
No.  Not at all.  Do we?
What's so fucking funny?
Too easy?
What d'you say, Elaine?
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
Here, are you always this sarky?
Weren't you on a television series?
Ashamed.
She was twenty-one when she came to me.  ... Straight from leaving you.
I might've been away for the weekend.
I should really give him a call.  He's a character, isn't he.  Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world.
Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.
You don't seem bothered.
-- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck.  One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.
Won't he be looking for you about now?
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
Because that wasn't anything to do with me.  And suspicion has been cast in my direction.  Didn't make any sense.  Choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
You sure?
That's too bad.  Ian's got a good thing going over there.
You'll be looking forward to getting back, then.
Which kind?
She's nice lookin'.
Like what.
You know her?
Is Valentine here?
Hello there.
Exercising my visitation rights.
You've made it ... brighter.
What kind of trouble are you in?
It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.
You must know Ian.
Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
...Yes?
Ann--
Ann--
Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
You're an enthusiast.
Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.
Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?
No problem!
...Just a second here, I'll give you a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm gonna call the place Tolliver's, after me, you know, I didn't think you were much interested in, uh--
Well, there it is. Writ large in legal escriture, next step is--
...You're not gonna screw me on this?
...Were you in the service, Ed?
...That's quite a wife you got there.
She's a rare one.
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
What kind of man *are* you?
Come on, get ready. It's important.
...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex.
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.
Should I... should I tell you why?
--don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.
...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
No thanks.
I'm fine.
Yeah. What do I, uh...
Coffee, Ed?
Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here.
Yeah.
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?
...You sure, Eddie?
...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
Mr...?
...You're Ed Crane?
Doesn't bother me.
Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned!
Beauregard!  You scared me half to death.
Looks like the curse is still at work.
Don't know if it'll do any good, Mr. Cuthbert.
Pendergast may be in trouble.  Don't you understand?  He still hasn't come back.  It's been over three hours --
If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence.
Yes.
Behind you.
Fifteen... what's next?
It's fool proof, basically.  I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip.  If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
Ippolito!  Get back here!
Careful.  That mess on the ground is brains.
Yes.  That's my case.  Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated.  Brains extracted.  Limbs torn to shreds.  It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.
I think I should come with you.
Vince?  There's no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. There's an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit.
Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed?
What's that?
We've met.  The Hacksaw Murders.  '89.
That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
Dr. Frock.  Did you hear that?
I'm coming with you.
Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?
Something tried to get into this room!
You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum.
Are there any hidden rooms or staircases?  Places where someone could hide?
You work here?
They were yellow!
There's something out there!  Let's go get it now!  That's why we came down here, isn't it?
Oh no.  I smell it.
I have the species identification on these teeth.  We can extract DNA and start running tests on the extrapolator program.  Call Dr. Frock.  He wanted a demonstration.
For once I'm glad you're rumor central.  What in the world is going on?
Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping. What is this?
Somehow, when all this happened... I knew it would come back to John.  Is he really dead?
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
How did you know that?
That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldn't leave me alone.
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.
What happened?
It's okay, I'm all right.  I remember now... It was an animal.  Something large!  I could smell it.  It was hunting me.  I saw two green eyes in the dark.
Pendergast?  Are you all right?
What happened?
We have to try and draw it off!
That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing.  The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!
I'm sorry to keep you.  How can I help?
It's the busy season.
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.
We've declared a curfew.  Everyone else is at first positions.
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
People forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running.
What's he doing?
Actually, I'm free Sunday.
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.
See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.
You really think it could've dropped off an airliner?
Marlon--
There's no point in trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening - elevators that don't go anywhere, people talking about me on the radio, you know what I mean?
What exactly?
That's the "Big Guy".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.
Well, what do you think?
Where have you been?
I know.
I'll take you home, Angela.  Why don't you leave those with us for a while?
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday.  I thought I'd make my potato salad.  Remind me--
It's hard to go places, isn't it?
About time they started cleaning up the trash Downtown.  We don't want to end up like the rest of the country.
Well, we're FBI agents.
You've been back to Dallas?
You've got something to show me.
We brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we've ever seen.
Who called this meeting?
Do they know?
Who?
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
How's that?
Who sent you?
I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?
I'll know soon enough.
-- You saw this experiment?
Mulder -- it's me --
I'm on the roof.
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
Jesus, Mulder...
Where are you, Mulder?
Scully, get somebody to open this door.
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
...thirteen fifty six...
Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
Are you drunk, Mulder?
This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?
Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
He didn't mention a park.
This looks like new grass to you?
You think they went left?
Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I?
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
Yeah, well they may this one.
Been where?
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
You hear that?
I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation.
We're going to the morgue.
Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.
-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
Are we being watched?
What are you doing?
Aids, the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs.
But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.
Why are you telling me this?
Let me remind you who is the new race. And who is the old.  What could be gained by withholding anything from them; By pretending to ignorance? Our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. To start Colonization early.
Sing a song of sixpence...
He hates me.
Sing a song of sixpence.
The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened?
...a pocketful of rye.
Damn him.
I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner.
...give a kiss to Edward.
Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
This is Stargher we're talking about?
A child can experience abuse worse than Charlie's.  And grow up to be someone who would never, ever hurt another living thing.
He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work.
Agent Cole.
When did he lapse into the coma?
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
Ich weiss nicht.
You were awfully good.
Well, I saw you at the funeral.
Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
He said he remembered me too. Seems to show he wasn't in much pain.
...at all.
What's she talking about?
Anything really wrong with your papers?
The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.
Can I hear you?
Do I...
Holly.
Let's not get into any more trouble.
Sneak out the other way, and go back to your theatre. I'd better not see you again.
I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.
He liked to laugh.
...is there?
That's his headache.
...quarrel?
Right. Sit down Miss Schmidt, we will send your letters and things back to you.
He works in a military hospital.
Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?
That's what we want to find out.
Here we are. You'll be all right here, Miss.
Yes.
Where?
Please keep this passport to yourself, until I make some inquiries, will you, Major?
My name is Calloway.
Back in school. Never so lonesome in my life till he showed up.
Did you ever hear of "The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?"
...to him.
...expense.
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
That is the racket Harry Lime organized.
So would I.
...be responsible for you in the streets.
A girl of spirit.
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
Win what?
What time is it?
Write her out a receipt, Paine. Give her a receipt for these letters too.
...of Santa Fe."
Well, yes. I suppose that is what I meant to say.
Striptease, sir.
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.
Do you expect me to give myself up?
Have you ever seen any of your victims?
You really liked it?
...you.
...your address?
...the best way one can, you know.
Not yet.
Mr. Popescu is here tonight.
Thank you.
Could he have been at all conscious?
Excuse me!
Did you know Mr. Lime well?
You remember me? Upstairs...
I was told that he did not die at once.
Kurtz.
There was a third man - he didn't give evidence.
I have no evidence. I saw nothing. I said nothing. It's not my business.
Harry...
That's all you meant?
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?
Where are you staying?
You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
Big?
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
Hi.
We lost our key.
Exactly. Always happened to someone else.
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
No one follows that midrash.
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.
They only kill them when they love them?
What, do you like it here?
How come you know all this shit?
Forget the Jewish stuff. It doesn't play anymore.  There's only the market, now, and it doesn't care who you are.
Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness?
Who's Linda?
When can I see you?
I'm coming to your room tonight.
Where'd you get this?
V'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. And make no graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because He's not like anything. Not only can't you see Him or hear Him, you can't even think about Him. I mean, what's the difference between that and Him not existing?
Fuck that.
Why should I submit?
Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?
You want a punch in the mouth?
Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
Carla?... It's me, Danny...Danny Balint...? We met at that...[meeting at your house.]
I didn't realize you cared.
More cultural than political.
Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven.
...Insulting people who were in the camps. ...What's the point?
I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
Is it okay if I record this?
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why?
You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
Deracinate... Tear out the roots. A people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. This is how they know themselves. But the Jew doesn't have soil.
What? Excuse me?...  You're kidding, right?
How do you reconcile the two?
Explain it so I can.
I always won.
Tell me about Lina Moebius.
How did you get the fucking number?
Lina Moebius. And you are...?
What is happening?
But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid.
He's going to die.  He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around.  I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble.
Isn't it true?
That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal.
Get out of here....
What is it?
I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brand-new power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up timer.
Not too fast.
When do you want it to go off?
Are you an artist?
Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.
How did you know they were Jews?
Shoot him in the head. Always shoot a Jew in the head.
Who's this?
Leary?
I'm not an intellectual.... I mean, I read, but... Fund-raising isn't what I...
...You're saying that when he first appeared at your house, you had no idea he was Jewish....
What do you mean?
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.
Did you tell him?
My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.
What's happened??
I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to...
Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
Jacques!  Johana!
... Not yet.
Dollars.
In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
Where did you get that?
Is that alcohol?  Are you out of your mind?  Alcohol is strictly forbidden.
Jacques, my friend, how are you?
It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere else.
No.
No, no!
Enzo?
Why?
No, I have to ask you a favor...  You're the only one who'll understand.
Hey!  Will you slow down!  When did you learn how to drive?
Good night.
Here...  Here...
Don't you have a heater?
In the lake?
Thanks for helping with the bag.  It looks great!
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
How can you tell it's a female?
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.
Bonjour Monsieur... Louis. 
This is the hotel San Domenico?
Why don't you ask me?
Assassin!
I changed the lock you son of a bitch!
You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled.
... And if we repaint the walls, we'll need new curtains, you put the painters on you Visa and I'll do the curtains on American Express... for the couch there's Bloomingdales...  or are you still over your limit?
Does that have a hidden meaning?
What are they for?
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
Who... Who is that?
Wait!  Professor...?
Looks like I got a plane to catch.
Hanukkah, Shmanukkah. It isn't even one of the high holidays. What concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty, and has yet to settle down with a nice Jewish girl.  I'll make you a deal. I'll help you with your little Hanukkah problem if you help me with my Mordechai.
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
Oy vey, I'm stuffed.
Want to get a drink?
What!?
Mordechai?
When did you guys have this conversation? When I was in the bathroom? What else did she have to say?
We do!
What are you doing here?
...and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels, and light the menorah with the knowl...
Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...I'm good enough and I won't leave here until I hear you tell me...
Okay, what's the information?
I wasn't too over the top?
Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.
This is for "mama and the kids."
They don't say it to me.
Sure, I like my leopards
What did they say before the bad card came up?
The death card - -
Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?
Doc -- something you said the other day --
Why?
Charlie doesn't think the leopard killed the girl in the cemetery.
We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
Tormented -- ? Why?
What do you do now?
That was unfortunate.
Yes. The lipstick.
That's a fact, isn't it?
You're too good to me.
Makes no difference.  Get him out.
Suppose I slip them a few bucks  for the funeral expenses.
It must be the altitude  you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of bootandsaddle boys --
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
No. No, thanks.  Now we've got to do it ourselves.
Kiki?
We stood here once before.
Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside - where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
Hot...  These roads all round here, closed to the public... Whys that? Military bases?  Huh. I guess theres space enough for war games... Must be good for business.
Good afternoon. De Moraess residence.
Three weeks ago. To borrow money. I wasnt here but he got to my husband, sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made. Carlos handed over 1,000 to get rid of him.
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
I cant tell you that yet. But hes being well looked after.
No. The question now is how long its going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard.
Who is Friedman?
Im impressed. That information could have cost me 20,000.
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. Ill give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
Mr Lombard...
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? Hes a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
Adonis thought your brothers bodyd be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didnt he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldnt have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.
Your brother stumbled upon Adoniss little secret, didnt he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more.  Leon didnt come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kids life. Your flunkey let him in, so his visit couldnt be concealed, hence the exhibition story. There was no exhibition. Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah? Leon does his own prints. Wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his Art.  I should have paid more attention to your words. Perhaps its the way you say them...
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed?
What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
You know something? Ive just seen so much ugliness I dont think Id mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  Id hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if thats the way you want it.
So you did talk about it, huh?
The word for those things is croissants.
You dont know why hes come to Los Angeles?  The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his?
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
Get a pen and dont ask any questions.
Friedmans dead... They killed him...
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house?
How many of you scumbags are here?
Im sorry but Mr Gluck is not answering, sir.  Would you like to leave a message?
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
La collectionoose. Its about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. Its on TV tonight and as Im in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says its about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The directors supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?
Ive got work tonight, Jane.
Shes pretty... See you, huh?
No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be.  Maybe its there with...
Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say youre my secretary, all right?
Id appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you cant, dont worry about it. Ill call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but Im in a hurry. 
Hello, Jane. Its me.
Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?
What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
I didnt mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
My husband and I will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in Israel. Deborah will be here if you need anything before our return.
This car needs petrol.
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
Maybe I dont.
Is this Friedman?
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. Youve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name hes using?
You seem very sure about that.
Your lady friend did.
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
Will you be alone?  The merchandise. Is it just you or...
A private investigator... Youre not Austrian?
Whats a French private investigator doing here?
Thats what he said. I tried to dissuade him... Told him I couldnt take on another child, that hed get into trouble... I mean, people who sell children... But he wasnt listening... I guess he finally found himself a crusade... His family think hes back on drugs, eh?  Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs. Went through his self-destruct phase, you know?  Things to come to terms with. Demons to fight... Some peoples minds are gloriously uncomplicated. Not Leons. He did beat the drug, though. He did.
Theyre German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. Its not guilt, more of a curse...  And then theres something about his parents being involved with Nazi hunters... But I think thats just one of Leons dark delusions...
Who else knows about the boy?
Whats the date?
Huh... I guess you aint quite ready for civilisation yet... Ill give you one more day, a meal, and then youre on your way.
Why did you kill him?
What sums?
When they realise Im missing...
They lost their son. Why?
Ha ha... Yes. With prices reaching an all time low, the name of the game has become have-it- where-its-at... As we all know, transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business...
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
Listen, please accept my apologies for... you know, me pretending to be the... well it wasn't really my idea... well, yes it was my idea but...
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
What did they say?
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
We must sound the retreat!
One day you will.
... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even...  ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!
No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
No...
Go onto the next question.
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
No!  I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?
Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is.  This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
You won't be able to drag anything from her that way.  You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
Don't worry about me -- just stay in here... and don't move!
Who are you?
So... begin by telling us your name -- assuming you're allowed to tell us that much?
How old are you?
When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?
Let me clarify things for you, Jeanne.  On the one hand there is the Church Triumphant, that is to say God, his saints, and the souls that are saved.  And then there is the Church Militant, that is to say our Holy Father the Pope, the cardinals, the prelates of the Church, the clergy, and all good Catholic Christians.  Moreover this Church, when assembled, is guided by the Holy Spirit and therefore cannot be in error.  That is why we ask you to submit to the Church Militant... that is to say, us.
I didn't mean it!  I didn't know what I was signing!  You tricked me...!
20,000?!  But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed.
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
Get them out of here!
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
He's probably right -- let's call a delay...
Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
Is it long and hanging down?
8,000.  We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.
Good.  Where are the English?
Stand by with the battering-rams...
Well...?  Shall we go?
And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
There must be something we can do for her for Chrissakes!
Jeanne... The men are exhausted!
Do you know how to count?
Did your voice tell you to jump?
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
What are you doing out here?
Why?  Are you waiting for someone else?
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
You mean God said, "I need you, Jeanne?"
What signs?
No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say well done.  Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
Yes...
You think you are ready now?
You know I'm always happy to see you, Jeanne, but to keep coming here twice, three times a day...
But you already confessed this morning...
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
And what about your other friends... you don't like playing with them?
Then... why are you here so often?
A beauty. Who is she?
Who are you?
Don't worry, it won't last long.
What did I tell you?
For what? For my tie?
Funny time to say this.
You know what we do? We use psychology.
You sell anything?
Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach?
What did you pay him?
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
You know what? You treat me like dirt!
Out of Warsaw.
And what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? Wander round lugging your suitcases?
You don't want to worry about that. My grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice.  In my opinion, jaundice is not very serious. Drink up.
What's all that gunfire?
What's happening?
I don't know how to thank you.
What about you?
I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.
How are the lessons going? ADA nods enthusiastically. He's getting on all right? ADA nods again Good.
One day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere. But so passionate was their singing that they did not notice, nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch... And at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb! She- never-spoke-another-word.
Well, that is a strong opinion.
I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
T-w~e-l-v~e.
She has spoken to me. I heard her voice. There was no sound, but I beard it here . Her voice was there in my head. I watched her lips, they did not make the words, yet the harder I listened the clearer I heard her, as clear as I hear you, as dear as I hear my own voice.
No, but her words are in my head.  I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.
She wants to see what you can do.
Everyone has to practice.
He says you're not to see her or he'll chop her up!
What?
We can't leave the piano
Is it all right? Aren't you going to play something? ADA pulls up a chair and seats herself at the piano. She rubs her hands and places them lightly on the keys, she turns from habit over her left shoulder where STEWART waits crossed armed. Quickly she removes her hands, stands and gestures FLORA to play. FLORA proudly takes ~p the seat, she pulls her lips in trying to control her happiness to say in front of both her mother and STEWART.
Which way are the rooms?
What are ya gonna do, call the cops?
Listen Duke, we're setting up a wire store.  I need a twenty man boost right away.
You're late.  Where you been?
In one goddamn night?  What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.
...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.
And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in.
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.
Wasn't no problem a mine.
Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.
Mottola.
We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at every track in the country.  You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
I'm sorry about Luther.  He was the best street worker I ever saw.
You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?
Lonnegan after you, too?
Gondorff, you gonna teach me the Big Con or not?
Aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side.
I'll take him anyway.
You just worry about your end, kid.
Everything go all right?
How 'bout Lonnegan?
You think he'll show?
You know how easy it'd be for one of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?
I better do some packin'.  I'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow.
Looks like he's sulking.
I guess I left it in my room.
Never get enough, huh pal?  I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan.
She coulda killed me last night.
My end was only one.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
What time you get off work here?
You got a back door to this place?
Looks like he missed ya.
I, ah...thought you might wanna come out for a while.  Maybe have a drink or somethin'.
Twist?  I told him the tale.  He wants to see ya.
I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
Ain't seen you in months, boy. Thought maybe you took a fall.
You sure you wanna start off that big?  Bet like that could put a real dent in us.
Your boss is quite a card player, Carver.  How does he do it?
So could Shaw.
If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself.
You're dreamin', kid.
You should always look to the back too, kid.
You really picked a winner, kid.
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
We were getting 50 from our guy.
Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
What is this?  I got work to do.
Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  But it's not gonna happen this time.  We're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it.
There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked.  And I think it explains everything.  You see, my father was a sexogenarian.
Cheer up, darling.
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
She's got me worrying, too.
Why did that man want to kill him?
Mind if I look around?
And don't ever try to see me again.
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
All right, then.  I'll tell them.
How did you ever remember me?
You heard about Julia Wolf?
Why... in the heart.
She fell down.
It's been the same one for three months.
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
Yes.
Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
How'd you people happen to pop in?
Not without a warrant.
No proof?
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?
Well, what'd you think?
Get anything?
Just rolled them up and threw them in.
Could this be him?
What're you doing here?
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
Shut up.
When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
He telephoned me today.
I wasn't in.  My secretary took the message.  He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.
About three.
What kind of clothes was he wearing?
Good morning --
I can't remember offhand, Lieutenant.  Maybe I was over at Charlie's shooting pool. Maybe I was here.  She'd remember.
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
That's my business.
That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
Oh, he's sitting up.
Did you get my money?
I wish you'd count them.  There's a thousand dollars there.
How are you?
You don't say --
Oh, Nick... Nick!
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
Where's Gilbert?
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
All right - you didn't.
Why do you say that?
What am I?  The fall guy?
Come on -- relax --  Give them a drink.
I'd better order some food.  That sounds like an interesting case.  Wouldn't you like to take it?
Where did you get that?
No thanks.
I'd like to see you work.
But it's Christmas now.
Nick!  Nick!  There's someone to she you,
You're a fine watch dog.
Who gave it to you?
Aren't you hot in that?
Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
What are you going to do?
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
Well, don't they?
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
Why not?
The suspects!  They won't come.
If that knife is missing, I'll look for it in your back.
You worked here?
Nick Charles here?
I just wanted to tell you...
Where are you going?
Where were you going?
Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is.
He's not so--
Ready?
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.
What happened?
Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted the gold.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you.
What!?  What!?
Don't even.  You're not going to show me that tired map.
Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
Steady it out!
She okay?
SAY IT!
What!?
I don't hear any--
Don't!
Where is it?  Where'd it go?
It looks like you're not doing anything.
He's not going to leave us.
We should head Northeast.
No.
Epps?
Sorry.
I pick that way.
You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
What do you figure it is?
Can't you--
What do we do?
Which way do we go!?
How do we do that?
Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now.  But I'd say you've been very fair.  I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.
I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.
Woods.
We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.
What does that mean?
You will.  You'll get it.
You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
You ever think about dying?
The longer the air force hits the Iraqis, the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage.
We...we could go home with something else.
Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
How long we going to keep this up.
If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.
It's got a bottom.
You down?
Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
I think he wants something to drink.
HUMMMM.....
When?
I don't know.
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started.  I almost let you go on so many times.  It will be worth it, together.  When I was alone, I knew.
What are you doing?
If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me.  You'll report me for drug evasion.
Are you all right?
They're watching us now.
Then why are they holding us here? Why don't they destroy us right away?  Economically, it's not sound at all.  Very much unlike....
You always manage to avoid the issue:  What's wrong with our present condition?  We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble?  You should examine your emotions.  It is senseless...
What's going on....what are you doing?
Who?  Who's leaving?
What's going on?
I won't have another mate like ONA.  You rate very high in sanitation.  I've checked.  In fact, I am surprised that you were ever matched with LUH.  Her ratings are very erratic - you know what I mean.  We'll be happy.
I'll report you.  It's....
...and you're not lost now?
Would you like part of this? ....It's not much.
You don't know that!
....I'm taking SP5, but it doesn't seem strong enough.  I have a hard time concentrating.  Please forgive me, I slipped on....
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
You are engaged in an unauthorized procedure.  Check cybernetic manual F-45.  If you do no have an F-45, you are in violation.  This is a double A restricted precinct. Remain where you are.  Authorities will arrive shortly.
They're not here.
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
Hey, that's the guy-
Coffee, Mike?
Just do it.
I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish?
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
Why do you do it?
I terrible with mechanical things.
Ex-girlfriend?
Driving in circles, waiting for-
More metal... sharp edge...
Whadaya mean?
Drop it.
You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you.
What the hell's going on?
He is!
How're you guys doing?
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
Fuckin A, I think I got two partial prints here!
Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
Mike...
Got it! Ace Match Company, Flint, Michigan.
T.J., what're you doing?
Captain...
Sir...
It's our only option.
What?  I may lose it again? But I haven't found it yet! I'm sorry. Goodbye!  Yes?
Pardon me, m'sieu. Madame Colet would like to see you in the living room.
on staircase; from Gaston's point of view. He stops.
And then what happened, M'sieu Filiba?
And harems ... ?
Good morning, Major.
Nice day, Major.
M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles.
You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
Disappointed?
That's hotel life. In one room a man loses his wallet  and in another room a man loses-- his head. 
The pepper, too?
Monescu!
I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight.  Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late! 
By the way, how is your German?
Don't you <u>realize</u>--
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
You like that statue?
Naturally I did.
You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.
But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.
What shade of powder do you use?
No! Not enough!  In times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
I'll be delighted.
Yes, madame?
But incidentally, let me tell you, <u>I</u> don't like <u>you</u>. I don't like you at all!  I wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin <u>your</u> reputation--like that! 
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
Ah, let me have a little fun.
Thirty-three--
Yes, Gaston?
You look beautiful.
Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
But my dear M'sieu Giron, I'm having a tea party. Must I be bothered with all these papers now?
You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
About what?
Now. Uh--mademoiselle--in the short time you have been M'sieu Laval's secretary, have you noticed any change in him?
Right!
I beg your pardon!
Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
You should be ashamed of yourselves. Two men of your standing, always quarreling.
But you're the more intelligent one.
You should have more self-control. You were in the army.
Your bag?
No--I'm sorry.
Yes, I saw it--but--
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.
Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats?
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.
Rush her.
There's a satellite call for you.
I told you you wanted to take this call.
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --
Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
You're precious to me, Rose.
Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm.  Sorry Fabrizio.
'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!
You know somebody?
The boats are all going.
You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.
The suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going.
So you've not lit the last four boilers then?
How cold?
HELP! HELP!!
Hello again.
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.
A whole ten cents?!
I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.
Now it's worse.
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
Will this work?
It's getting quiet.
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
I'm sorry.
Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond.
My God, Rose, what's gotten into --
It would be a nice change from you.
Hope we're not intruding.
Well--shall we go into dinner?
Oh--a hundred times--
I can think of nothing nicer. It's very kind of you to invite me--
I hope so.
Isn't she lovely?
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
--that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.
What did you want a gun for?
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. 
Could I see you a minute?
And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.
Like her paint job?
There's soft music--
Aw--give a feller a break. My cards are on the table-- I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?
Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.
I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
Isn't she attractive?
Don't be a c-a-t.
Yes?
Don't rub it in.
Sooner it you like.
Mighty decent of you, pal.
Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.
What, again?
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
Well, I'll be--!!!
Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
You don't think--?
Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.
My change.
Shortie!--you know my motto?
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
They won't squawk--they're professionals.
Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.
About sixteen hundred.
You keep it-- 
Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, I've sworn off playing poker.
I thought you were a sucker--
This is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
That's all right. I'll attend to this.
Now we get it down to two words--"next month."
Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?
Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
Hello, Denby!
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank.  Where is your wife?
Come on, get up.  That horse is carrying too much of a load.
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
Am I a member of this club?
Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
Yes.
Well, let's hear the poem--
Very good, Mary--
Is that one of the Who's Who?
Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?
Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--
You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.
I wish I could.
He's all right.
I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.
No!
Isn't it great to be away from it all? Aren't you happy? It seems too good to be true.
I'll explain later--
What d'you think of the singer?
The man dealing faro.  Who is he?
Well I guess you can see, never a Dull moment.  Maybe you should Stay around to see what happens Next.  Who know?  You might find a Future here.
Where'd you get that horse?
Hey, you smell that?  Smells like Something died.
Fair enough.  You know I got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this.
Forget it.
I said forget it, answer's no, I Don't want the job and that's Final.  I'm going to Tombstone and Nothin' short of dyin's gonn Stop me.  Good day.
You don't even know him.
Doc!  How the hell are you?
So tell me, Wyatt.  I'm curious. Do you actually consider youself A married man?  Forsaking all Others?
Satisfied?
Maybe I ought to go out there.
I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much
Wyatt, my God!  You're shot to pieces!
I'm a man without fear, Wyatt.  I Literally don't care if I live or Die.  But even I can't fight human Instinct.  Somebody suddenly Starts shooting at me, I duck. But you... what on earth were You thinking about?
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative.
Drunks.  Crawfished a bet, called Him a liar.  I saw the whole thing.
You really look awful.
Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed.
I don't believe it.  He's clean!
Can't take the heat, get outta The kitchen.
Hello, Wyatt!  Hiya Doc!
Are you out of your mind?  What on Earth'd make us-
No.
But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him.  So help me God, I would.
Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words.
You know, we might just pull this off.
Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life?
Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
I must say this certainly has Been an unexpected little Windfall.
Sorry about your friend.  And I'm sorry about...
You see that bird at the faro Table?  That's Johnny Tyler.  He Barged in here one day, said he Was takin' over the game, started Slappin' customer, wavin' his Gun around, scarin' off all the High-class play.  Only trade comes In here now's just bummers and Drovers, just the dregs.
Come up to the fire, honey.
Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?

Thought you swore you'd never Carry that thing again.
Isn't there anything I can say That'll change your mind?  You're Gonna stay with your new friends?
Run for your lives, boys!  It's That great two-gun dog-catcher From Kansas!
So what about you Cowboys anyway?
I ain't your brother, I ain't None of your damn brothers.  Move!
Next waterhole's Black Draw.  We Could be there by mid-morning.
I don't like it.
Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal.
Yeah?
How you doin', boy?
Dropped him, that was it.  Sorry If I made a worse mess for you.
Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'?
Easy, gents. Private affair...  Wyatt! Doc! Hey!
Well that's your problem.  Hey Virge, see anything of Doc while You were in Prescott?
You know, I was thinkin', maybe We ought to open our own place. That's the real money.  Build it Up, milk it for all it's worth, Then sell it off for a bundle and Breeze out of this burg with more Money than Croesus and ready to Live like kings.  Let's you and me Take a walk around town, Virge, See if we can scout us out a Couple of nice lots.
I appreciate your assistance, M. But this is now a military operation.
Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects...  Especially one with such distinguished friends.
Before I became involved with Paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men...  Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle aged Peter Pans who only brought out the worst in her.
I call this the Rogue's gallery.
I'm sure they will.
...So that's what the weapons grade uranium was for.
- Instant melt-down.
I'd rather die alone.
Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'
Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
I'm sure she is, James. But I'm afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the rest of your lessons this afternoon.
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
Your new car. 
Wait a minute -
Do you feel better now?
Paris -
His newspapers?
Wade, what the hell are you doing here?
What do you want with the Harbor Master?
Natalya?
Have we met?
Do I have to do everything around here?
Wait here.
... How did you get into marine salvage?
What the hell does that do?
.... I hate to ask, but... Did you ever think you'd miss Communism?
Sorry I'm late -
...You're turning into quite the politician, 007.
... And what do you call these?
What's your name?
No.
Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.
A dead head.  Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west.  Muncy! Engines to half!
Obviously, the British government denies all of this -
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
Hong Kong, Mr. Bond!
Take the men. I can finish alone.
What the hell is going on?
Why, you don't want us to bring him over?
When are you boys going to fix that roof?
When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.
I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
Why does he always pick on me?
I have more sense than to give up everything, my family, you and Sunny. It wasn't me, I mean the real me inside my body. I'm glad it's over. It's like a veil has been lifted.
Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be.
Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.
I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time.
My mind plays tricks on me. Is it okay if I take a bath now?
Let us settle this tomorrow.
You know, Babe Brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them.
How is the garden doing?
What, are you having another party?
He's going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water, "I thought the streets were paved with gold." "They are but you won't see them," he said. "Boy, you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness." So he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell. He sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back, picking their teeth. "Man, this is a dream." He asked, "What's you'll doing?" They all hollered back, "Sinning." The devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said, "Please to meet you." He asked, "I thought you'll was supposed to be burning in fire." Someone said, "Man, ain't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins." The man was going go ask the preacher back on earth...
This is my grandson, Sunny. He is my youngest son's child.
I came all the way from Detroit by bus going to Oakland. The bus stopped in Los Angeles. I had to get off and take a rest. I'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight. I'm just too tired to go on.
Man, put your boxes down and stay as long as you like. We have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out.
Man, act like this is your home.
Good evening. It must be all the different time zones I crossed that makes me feel this weary.
Ah, you young folks don't know how it is. How is Gideon today?
That smells like fresh coffee.
As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman.
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?
Those boys never did have good luck.
A woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days.
I couldn't believe it when Suzie called and said you were staying here. How have you been?
None of your business.
All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
I let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that I lost years ago.
You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.
Counting the what? What does that have to do with the price of butter?
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
Can I bring some toys?
Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
Next stop...
Mom, have you seen Woody?
Everybody say, "Bye, house."
Hey!  Wow!
Hello-o-o...
Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
Can!
You actually think you're THE "Buzz Lightyear?" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!  Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear!
THAT is Sid!
Right?  Buddy?
My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Great!
Uh, Buzz?!  We missed the truck!
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
Are you peeking?
Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...
Who is it this time?
Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
You are a liar!
No wait!  You don't understand! Buzz is out there!  We've gotta help him!!
ROOAAAARR!!!
Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?!
I got it, Woody!
There.
Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
I can't hold on much longer!
I like plaits.
Mummy was scared of him, I think. He went to her wedding but he was <i>furious</i>, you can see it in the photograph.
Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
You're only a young thing.
Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible.
Would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while?
He'll murder you when he finds out.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
I thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.
You're well built; how old are you?
Even if that were true, they're not going to come to your house where you're waiting for them.
He's not here.
What is he planning on telling them?
Helena, I'm so sorry --
This place is swept twice a day.  I learned that in Miami in '85.  Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wack-a-mole.  Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here.  And San Diego is so much more relaxing.
Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people.  Only Carl knows who they are.  That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't know Ruiz.  Church and State.
Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if Carl doesn't get out.  I'm not very adept at being on my own.  I've always had a man in my life.  Always.
Helena, please.  This is out of your hands.
So you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise.  Superfund is just one of those words.  People stop paying attention.
Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
How long have you known?
I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar.  It's this General, Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.
Oh, it is?
About the other night, I'm sorry.
Are you going to?
Hi.
Do you work?
You know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day?  He and my mom have cocktail hour every night, from six to seven, set your clock, two bourbons --
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
They're whispering.  I can't hear them, but I know it.  I smell conspiracy.  I feel the lie vibrating out of the home.
I have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people.
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
This attitude's not gonna help him any, is it?
We aren't barbarians.
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
Take this back with you.  Deliver it safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and we have a deal.
You will help me with my other problem.
It's important that we work together. Mexico.  America.  One hand washing the other.
What is the name of your informant?
Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.
The busiest land border crossing in the world.  Over forty-one thousand vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot.  I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
Well, I've not brought them.
Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.
What's your name?
Where's that?
Do you find that this approach usually works, or, let me guess, you've never tried it before. In fact, you don't normally approach girls, am I right? The truth is that you're a quite, sensitive type but if I'm prepared to take a chance I might just get to know the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don't us girls just love that?
What?
And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
I bet Lizzy told him where to put it.
Well, Mr. Renton, I see that you attended the Royal Edinburgh College.
I'm an old boy myself, you know?
Do you recall the school motto?
I'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now.
That's nice.
If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your Giro is fucking finished, right?
But try too hard --
It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
A little too well, if anything, a little too well, that's my only fear, compadre.
Running time?
Screenwriter?
Who wrote it?
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
Do you see the beast? Have you got it in you sights?
Eughh. Sounds horrible.
You know.
Cut it out.
But you don't have the money?
From time to time, even I have uttered the magic words.
No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.
Great.
Sure.
You'll have to send us a postcard.
This had better be good.
How long is it?
A walk.
Homeless people?
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
It could. Yes.
Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.
Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down.
Um... yes. We've been caught in a blizzard!
Sulu, what are you doing?
But the shuttle-
What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.
What is it you seek?
A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.
Goodnight, Spock.
There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.
Klingon vessel now entering quadrant. Bird of Prey. Estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear.
Exactly 15.5 seconds.
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
How do you know?
There Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist.
I am here, Captain.
There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room.
...mark two.
Spock, I thought I was going to die.
Maybe he's not out there, Bones. Maybe he's right here... in the human heart  Spock?
Who are you?
Your vision?
No special conditions?



And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
I know you better than that.
Sherman, set the Wayback Machine for...oh, 1973. Kevin Flynn  is one of the brightest young software engineers at ICOM. He's so bright that he starts going in there at night, and sets up a private memory file, and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing, called...  ...Space Paranoids.
Dillinger?
Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...
My dinner.
Want one?
Your old files -- ?
I want to go to his place.
What for?
Flynn!
Way to go! We're haulin'!
No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show...  What's up?
I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe.
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
Oh, I know all that. Sometimes I wish I was back in that garage...
Yes?
Well I want to communicate --
Alan!
What, just the three of us?
Did we make it?
Boy the view from up here... you know the territory?
Feel what? You okay?
So...how's the world of serious science?
Thank. you, Master Control.
Yes, MCP.
But-what if I can't...?
Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
New guy...
You've grown, big program.
Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.
We have to get off this beam!
I mean, it's not like he's saving the world or anything.  He's a sales rep for Chrissakes. Whenever I can't get to sleep I ask him to tell me about his day. Six seconds and I'm out.  But he acts like he's curing cancer or something.
Helen!  It's your mystery man.
That's not true, honey--
Dana, Mr. Hardy called.  Why weren't you in class today?
You seem fine now.
Dana, are you listening to me?
There are going to be some changes Dana.  You're going to start following some rules.  And I'm going to be there to see that you do.
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
And this is a little above market-				* rate for the horizontal bop, even				* for a total biscuit like her.
They call him "The Sand Spider".				*
It doesn't mean anything.  She buys antiquities for Khaled.
It's all set up...  ghost phones and fax, all the usual stuff. You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel under Renquist.  Okay, reality check.  Go.
Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?
Is this national security stuff boring you?
Guy's a spook!
Give me the page.
She could be telling the truth.
I'd like to remind you that it has been ten years since you were actually in one of these.
God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
This is Persian, if I'm not mistaken.
Call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces.
Do you like my tomb?  The museum				* financing fell out, so I thought				* your clients might be interested.
Especially in this light.  This is the only light they had then,				* so I like to study it this way. I love this place.  I love all ruins.
Hello, Harry.
That's fabulous Harry.
Uh huh.  Okay.
It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--
...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable...  really wild.
Uh huh.
You weren't attracted to him at all?
That's none of your goddamn business!  What kind of questions are these?
He's got nothing to do with this. It's me you want, right?
17 years.
I don't take those assignments.
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  He looked like such a dope.
Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them.
Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
You working on someone right now?
What does she do?
Yeeaoowww!!
Are you sure you weren't followed?
Tell me what happened?
Were they trying to kill you?					*
What do you want me to do?
Who is this woman?
He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.
Did you get the letter?
That was so good I am gonna have another.
... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid before, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished, crowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and my dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus appears, and the bus-driver says, "Get her in here.". He forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was from. And, so there you go.
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
Great movie. Action-packed!
Well, enough about the King. How about you?
I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.
Wow. What a swell place to work.
You know when you sat behind me?
She OD'd, didn't she?
What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?
You're a whore?
Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.
No no no no no no no no no...
Where you goin', honey?
Sweetheart, write down your former address.
Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker. He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate airports.
I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?
I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
I'm hip.
Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?
Naw naw!
Yeah.
Yeah.
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
Where the fuck is that bitch?
Grab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We got everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know.
It's great to hear from you.
I'm a married man.
This is Drexl's coke?
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
What'd'ya tell 'em?
What's this acting class guy's name?
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
Clarence.
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.
I'd fuck Elvis.
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?
We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.
Where's everybody else?
Well, I guess it's about that time.
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
I don't know, Clarence, "Doctor Zhivago" is a pretty big movie.
Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to "Doctor Zhivago" are in arbitration?
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
Where'd you go?
Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.
I think there's a Seven-Up in there.
I really don't know.
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
Keep it.
I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is Vincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man your son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard od us before. Am I correct?
I don't believe you.
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Where'd he come from?
Do you believe him?
Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.
But a fuckin' baggie.
Nicholson and I.
Like gang-busters. Now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta put your boss in jail.
Looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with Cherry Seven-Up.
You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?
I'll keep lover boy here entertained.  You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her suck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's done it before. But I want you as a audience.  Marty, what the fuck are you doin'?
Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.
Do you live here?
Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti.  Do you know Nick Cardella?
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
Wake up, Cole.
Him?  You saw that man?
He's drugged out of his mind!  He's completely zoned out.
It's important to observe everything.
Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?
I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you "James"?
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
Why not?  Most people have some ID.
You're afraid of germs?
"Never cry wolf!"
No, I think it was always you.  It's very strange.
You didn't have a gun before, did you?
I told you what I want.  Lock the door!
The guy was a total fruitcake.
We need gas.
What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?
James!  That's a policeman.  Pretend you don't know me.  If he sees you...
I don't understand what we're doing.
You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
You were in my dream just now.  I didn't recognize you.
James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West!
What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.
Excuse me -- what did you say?
Me?  Are you kiddin?  You're the one! You were a hero, man.  They gave you a pardon!  And whadda you do?  You come back and fuck with your teeth!  Wow!
The phone call, man.  The phone call.
Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.  You know the difference between what's real and what's not.
You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever "developed" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!
One dozen bolt cutters!  Whadda you gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters?
Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about flashlights?  How many flashlights...?
That would explain the bruises, I guess.  The struggle.
Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
Nine thirty
Hey!  You there!
Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
Get me a Dr. Peppa!  I don't want no Pepsi.  Pepsi ain't nothing but flavored water.
Oh, Jesus.
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
The day wasn't so bad.  We all got through it all right.
You afraid of the dark?
You don't fear death?
I'll take a piece of that bet. I say it doesn't come up five times each side.
It's a Movado.
Thirty-bucks?  That's it?
And what are you?  A rocket scientist?
Where to?
We have a bus to Mexico.  Arrives in two hours.  Have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across the border.
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
You own this place?
Somewhere else?  Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here.  How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself?
How much time?
Accident.
Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch!
What the hell . . . oh it's you. Might've figured.  What do you want?
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
What was that all about?
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
Is that right?  Can't say as I blame you for wanting to head out for a bit.  I know I've had my fill of this town.  Sixteen years I've been the law and order here.  So long I forgot why I ever wanted the job in the first place.  Help people, I guess.  Keep the peace.  Problem is there's so much peace around here they don't much need me.  Got a lot of speeders, but they're speeding through miles of nothing so I can't hardly blame them.  Other than that, well, there ain't much to steal.  I reckon that the last big crime we had was, what would you say Mrs. McKenna?  A murder?
I could do that.  'Course we'd have to go back into town.  There'd be a whole crowd of people around when the trunk was opened.  A whole crowd of witnesses.  That wouldn't be too pretty, now would it?
I put up new drapes, Jake.
They look nice.
What's the matter?
Oh my God, Jake, no.  If it is someone they'll go away.  Or call the police.  Don't go out there.
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
I got it.
Least you can leave.
Where you headed?
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
What happens if you lose?
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
Where'd you learn to do that?
Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
I'm guessing no.
Take me with you.
It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I could if I had Jake's money.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
Grace . . . Grace?
There's easily a hundred-thousand in there.  More than that.
Let's do it here.
John!?  What the hell's the matter with you?
John . . .?
I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
Are you kidding?  I'm not going down with you for killing a cop.
<u>We</u> killed Jake.  And it's a big difference.  You kill an old man, that's one thing.  Nobody cares about an old man.  You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never.
John, throw me the keys.
Someone will find me.
Who the hell are you?
I . . I was helping your wife.  I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
Where you headed?
I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
You meant it.
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
I went to your place.  We talked, just like you told me.  We drove out into the desert . . .
No.
You love her, but you hate her?
Yeah, well, me too.
It's not like that.
It's the truth, Jake.
I'm curious about something.  I'm wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom's at.
Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.
Toby!  Toby Tyler, leave him alone!
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
Hey, Mister.  Mister.  I just. . . I just wanted to thank you.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
Mister!
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
That's a shame, John.  A real shame.
Let me get this straight:  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
Do you understand me you little fuck?
There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.
That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.
Just cool down, son.  I ain't accusing you of anything.  Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them fighting the commies.  Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
Oh, Jesus.
More or less.
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
Now, what's this?
Who the hell is this!?
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit.  A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh? Women.
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! <u>You</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.
That's my gun... That fucking Darrell!
Got any requests?
Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
Will he be back soon?
You own this place?
Twenty-after-ten.
Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through."  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
Two-hundred.
Got any cold soda?
I call the sheriff.
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
It's very nice of you to help me.  That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
Thank you, Bobby.
Drove into Superior?  What for?
You've been around.
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
I didn't say it bothered me.
What do you do anyway?
Where'd you learn to do that?
A medicine man?
You never did answer my question.
I'm guessing no.
All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't. I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can.
You'd never understand.
Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world.
It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean <u>all the time</u>.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
The money's right here! Get the key!
What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
You know I thought you'd left me back there.
Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the money, then you're on your own.
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
And I love you too.
<u>Jake</u>...
Morning, officer.
There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
The old lady?
What'd you say to me!
One way, or round trip?
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
Keep your change.  Bus three-twenty-three. Leaves at seven fifty two, tonight.
Beck's.
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated.
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It's <u>you</u>. You <u>Grace</u> or nothing. The whole thing... I want you to be my wife.... What do you way Grace?
Goddamnit Virgil, stop!  Don't!
What's the matter?
Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.
What's that?  ..."concealed" is a definite no no in this town, Ivan. You know anything about Jamilla's grocery store?
Get out of the car, spread them. You can jawbone all you want or you have the right to <u>shut the fuck up</u>! You commie motherfucker. Either way you're goin' to the can.
No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.
Wrap it up.
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
Is that what you wanted to ask me?
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
I remember you.
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
Maybe it wasn't a specific moment, maybe it--
I assumed because of the train.
You forgot the "Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on" step. See usually that comes before the, "It's over" Step. And it always, always comes before the "You can go" Step.  What is over?
What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?
Just give me a minute.
Yes.
Quick.
I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color.
Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name.
He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
When?
You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.
How much did you take off?
That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me.
I'll just shoot him once.
Not really.
You are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. You were in a serious accident.  How's your vision?
Was your family traveling with you?
Did you get up from your seat?
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
Well, go get it then.
What'd he say?
He didn't say nothin', huh?
Oh. How long I been here?
Them other two, they been takin' advances on the payment.
What I heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck.
We got one of them fuckers, Sheriff, out by Cow Creek, we...
This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
Hit your finger, huh?
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
I could run off them whores.
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house.
The... Duck of Death.
Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.
But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...
But... if he doesn't miss?
A sign on him?
He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.
What for?
Don't tell nobody about the reward an' all. Don't need no other gunmen tryin' to collect.
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
Finish him, Ned.
Did you kill him?
What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on?
Shit!
He ain't killed.
Is it him?
Say, Bill...
This here money, take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. Tell 'em half goes to Sally Two Trees if I ain't back in a week. The rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.
Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
HEY, KID.
Now Ned's a hell of a shot with a rifle. Hell, he can hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'.
No.
You... you remember Eagle Hendershot?
Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together.
What is it, son?
Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass.
His pistol must of jammed.
I don't kill nobody without him. 
Depends what he told you.  About Bill, you mean?
Well, suppose he does?
That ain't what I mean.
A boy came across a body on the beach this morning. Thrown clear when the boat burned. Shot once in the head. Two guys from the F.B.I. just identified him.                     +
Now remember, this is another kind of business. They don't earn your respect. You owe it to them. Don't stare them down but don't look away either. Confidence. They are fools not to trust you. That's the attitude.
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -
Don't give up on me now, Dean.
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
Fuck you. I'11 never shit right again. So who did it? Own up.
You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal.
I'm sure you can understand my hesitation.
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.
Roger really. People say I talk too much.
How do you do?
I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things -
They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.
How are they going to do it?
What is it Keaton?
What if I
How are you, Keaton?
Ready?
You set up the line-up.
What did you say?
A little of both.
I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking. He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.
Verbal, you know we're trying to help you.
Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have. Total immunity .
The first thing I learned on the job, know what it was? How to spot a murderer. Let's say you arrest three guys for the same killing. Put them all in jail overnight. The next morning, whoever is sleeping is your man. If you're guilty, you know you're caught, you get some rest - let your guard down, you follow?
Heartwarming. Really, I feel weepy.
You got him wrong.
I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me?
A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.
TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW EVERYTHING .
Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'
No...
This is all bullshit.
You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's.
Mr. Abraham...
Abrams.  Yes.  How are you today?
How good's your intelligence?
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
He was accused of jury tampering.
I know that answer.  If we went to trial would we win?
You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
No, actually, she was referred to me.  She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
Say it.
Answer affirmatively.  Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  Isn't that right?
We went to Code Blue...
Well, many reasons, actually...
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
...to save her and to save the baby.  Is that...
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
How old are you?
Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
Mr. Concannon...?
Objection!  This is ri...expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
It's all right, Mickey.
I am on the staff of...
I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
...apartment.   No, no. Please.  You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
I didn't do too well for you.
You know...sometimes people can surprise you.  Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.'  General textbook on the subject.  Is  that correct?
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no  question of that.  It's just a matter of how big...
Then why don't you testify?
I'm sure it is, Frank:  and let me tell you something.  If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?   See my point?  Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Do we have time this morning to... All right.  Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
Listen to me, fella...
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
Hello, I'm calling from...
This is Miss Costello...?
Pardon?
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists.  The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh?  But to give them a chance at justice.
They might.  Yes.  That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe.  They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe.  I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.   I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve.  And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham.  There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...'
Maybe I can do something right.
Is this a bad time.
What happened...?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
You're pressuring yourself...
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
Are you out of your mind...?
Mick.  Mick.  Mick...
You -- Listen:  you said to me, `if not now, when...'
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up.
Jimmy?  Bushmills.   Lookit, do me a favor.  I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
Okay.  What do you do when you don't have a witness?
`You guys are a bunch of whores...uh...loyalty...you don't care who gets hurt...you don't have any loyalty...'
...yeah...good...
We got a mistrial, you know.  Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
... I know.  I went ...
What does it mean?    I...I mean we, you have other tactics...
Thank you.
Mrs. Simmonds.
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
Another, Frank . . . ?
I want to buy you a drink.
Yes.
Franky can't make it.  He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later.  I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
I didn't mean to be that rough.
No.
Watched her come out of the apartment, someone I didn't know... walking in a different way... holding her head in a way I didn't know; and get into her car, and drive out to...  Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore, the Portals of the Past. Sat there a long time, not moving... and I had to leave, to got to the office. That evening, when I came home, I asked what she'd done all day. She said she'd driven to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake. That's all.
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
Ernie's.
Why did she never tell her daughter?
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
Just let me talk to you.
You.
I've heard that one before, too. I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked.  Huh!
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
What do you want to know?
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before.  Okay.
Mmm.
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
No? Then what?
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
You want me to dress like her?
Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
Well?
Mmmm.
I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?
We're going awfully far.
Why?
Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power...  he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything?
What are you going to do?
Do you remember where you were?
...Old Port Point!  Out at the Presidio! Of course I remember! I often go there!
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...
Do you know where you're going?
Why?
Would you like a drink of water?
Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...
I'm responsible for you now, you know.  The Chinese say that once you have saved someone's life, you are responsible for it forever. And so I'm committed. And I have to know.
Would you know the room?
What else?
There's a name on the gravestone.
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
Where's your husband?
Yes --
Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!
Here with you.
Yes.
My love... because I love you.
There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.
Why?
It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
From that music.
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
Pop Leibel? Sure.
Now then, Johnny-O; pay me.
I've told you enough.
Out. I've got things to do.
I did. Since when do you go about slipping notes under men's doors?
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
She died.
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
How ya doing?
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
Name one.
Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...
The hell I don't.
Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us.
About anybody but yourself. You never have.
If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.
What are you doing?
We have to call the ambulance.
Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!
Just stop.
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
Wait. Wait a minute.
You got us into this mess.
Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
Fuck you Boyd!
What is your problem?
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right?
Where's the candy?
That's one idea.
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
Have you thought about what I said?
What is it?
That's right.
No I don't.
But not tonight.
Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold.
No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.
We need padded chairs.
Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here.
Oh God. This is insane.
Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation.
That's right.
My what?
Whatever you say Kojak.
Nope.
Then what do they have?
There's my point exactly.
Take Mexico.
This is going to stop right now. Right now!
The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know?
We're goosed! Goosed by God!
Are we supposed to?
Did you send in all of the deposit checks?
Caterer?
Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality?
He's weird.
We've got problems here.
Keith do not trivialize this.
Do you love me?
Take care of those chairs.
Hi.  Are you calling from jail?
Where are you?
How late?
"Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me.
This is our honeymoon.
No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
I told Boyd two fucking minutes!
No...
I wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you. You know, just to be with you, father and son, before you run off and do your own husband, daddy thing.  I'm just so Goddamn proud of you...God knows I didn't always play it right with you...
That's just insecurity.
Dear God...I don't know how to pray.
Do you hear buzzing Fish?
Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo".
That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?
I'm thinking about maybe making a move.
Well that ought to be about the end of that.
We don't think so. I mean, we just want the singing when I come out.
We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.
Good times.
Right.
Shut up Micheal.
You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
When I wasn't so miserable I used to sell pigs. Begging your pardon, I was more honest than my holy Mother.
Take me there.
Come down here, you scamp.
How like your aunt you are, even in your walk.
What do you mean?
No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and death.
This evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.
Leave us alone, Ramona.
Leave me now. You can go to bed.
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
Me?
It's very good.
Not in that way; you're always looking for company.
So, Ramona!
Maybe afterwards he'll let me ...
Me, rich? Come on!
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
What do you know about me?
What are you doing here? Get out.
Yes. Why?
Is she coming back?
And remember, the less he eats, the better he runs.
They're varicose veins, miss, but some days I can't take care of them.
How are you today?
How do you do, Miss Viridiana!
I'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead! You mustn't play under this tree.
What's going on, Moncho?
In you go! Moncho, lead the way!  You stay here.
I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him.
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
She has the face of an angel. What a pity you can't see her.
What about you, Manuel?
What happened to me?
It was very wellhidden. There was no way to see it until it was too late.
My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate.
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
Don't worry, they have no idea where you are.
When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head?
I should have told him.
There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.
I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive.
What happens if I can't catch him?
You know how much man power you're talking about?
What did Cox pull him out early for?
Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
You've had a yearandahalf to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
Get that fucking thing away from me!
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
You need a maid.
I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world.
If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR.
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
My God...
How can I ever thankyou for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?
Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality?
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonof-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
Give me your wrist.
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
I forgot what real coffee tastes like...
Relax. I know what you meant.
What did you do to those people?
You know I am.
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
Can I ask you something?
My guess is dead.
The symphony of collision...
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
It's really too bad you have to miss the Grand Finale.
There you go  best seat in the house.
What about it?
Waal, Mr. Moss, I wouldn't....
Alright, well, alright:  geopolitically...
Ames here.  <u>Yessir</u>... 
Y'see, <u>this</u> is what Producing is:  you put me in a <u>Room</u>...
...The Albanian Campaign...
Yeeaahhh...  Ohmigod ... ohmigod... ohmigod...
You're not <u>thinking</u> right, Pal...
Three minutes.  It couldn't have been over three minutes, the Secret Service...
It won't hold.
Twenty thousand dollars.
Tell, tell, tell me again.
Tell me again.
I <u>live</u> for midnight, when I can tear another of those suckers off.  Watcha got for me?
Stanley Moss, Ladeesngennlmen... And she says...
Our adopted land...
...I just missed my plane.
Well, keep your <u>wits</u> about you, and let's see if we can't...
Oh, God...
War's over, Pal. 
Ronnie says we don't need'em for another four days.  ...s'there a problem?
...child at the airport...  breaks through the ranks, runs to "old shoe" -- should we have <u>flower</u> or a <u>bear</u>...?
What about him?
Stanley, you can't do this....
Oh, MiGod.
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
"...where's my pill..."
AS WE LOOK UP, WE SEE THE PRESIDENT BITING HIS LIP, AND CONTINUING WITH THE SPEECH.
OVER A SLEEPING BREAN, STRETCHED OUT ON A POOLCHAIR, GRACE, THE SECRETARY, COMES OUT ON TO THE POOL AREA, HOLDING THE SHOT OF A SMALL, FOREIGN LOOKING CHILD, IN FRONT OF A PILE OF RUBBLE. SHE SHOWS IT TO MOSS.
ON THE GAS STATION OWNER, WHO HAS RETREATED TO HIS COUNTER AND PRODUCES A SHOTGUN, AND STARTS TO LOAD IT.
Would somebody wake me in five minutes?
We're locked into Albania.
Hello...?
We're due at Andrews. 
Ask it.
Is there a press conference today?
How much...?
If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we...
String a few together.  All I need's eleven,
What do you think would hold it off?
Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
Who?
"The Country Is At War." 
What do we have that they want?
Well, you could <u>have</u> one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  We're <u>done</u> in 10 days...
"Back End" ... count on it.
King, King, I got a thing here, a product placement, gonna have a bigger back-end than Hattie McDaniel. Now:
What is it?
What?
What're you gonna do with Morse Code?
In the Folk Music Section.
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Not bad for government work.  Having a good time.
Mmm...
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
Whattaya gonna do when this is all over?
I thought they weren't meeting him at the airport...
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
An anti-psychotic...
What the hell do <u>we</u> care?
No, I'm fine... I got it together....
You see?  What's the lesson here?  <u>Never</u> give up. <u>Never</u> give up.
Show Must Go On.
William Schuman.  Old Shoe.  U.S. Army.  Serial number, 21-31-2841-262.
Hold it a minute, Benny, willya?
Look, look, look, look, Canada, okay...?  Our neighbor to the North, alla sudden, transformed, into That Place, where, like the North Wind, <u>Terror</u> comes...
Headshots.  Girls to play the girl in our footage.  I like the sorrowful one.  Anybody Else....? 
All part of the Service we Render.
Uh...uh... Mounties.  The Mounties Guard The Border. uh... those Mountie Hats.
Do it later...  Okay,  now, "The Little Girl," who is she, what is she doing?  She is....she's ...Okay, okay, it's an Albanian village... She is the victim of, she has been <u>relocated</u>, to, to, for the <u>terrorists</u>, the Government Labs...the, the... a <u>staging</u> area for their Atomic workshop.  They're torturing her family, because they have connections in Canada, which would permit the terrorists access to the American Border.
It's tough to rhyme.
What would be true, then.
This is <u>nothing</u>,  Wait'll you've worked with a movie star, one time, this is nothing, we keep him shot-up and happy -- the Old Days, I used to think I was a <u>pharmacist</u>, the kind of stuff I had to do.  One time...
...gimme some help...
...where's my l'il <u>pill</u>?
...you take that Anacott Steel?
Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to you.  You know what my dream is? One day to be on the other end of that phone...
...got tickets for the Knicks tonight. Go out and cruise some bimbos afterwards, whaddaya say?
Got a little action there, eh buddy?
You know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy. That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum--to change that shitty attitude of yours.
Sell?
I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman.
I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
What brings you out here...
He's got your prick in his back pocket, son, and you're standing naked in the display window of Macy's. He's using you. Only you're too blind to see it.
It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get.
So, where are we going?
Rising profits...strong balance sheets, good earnings per share.
So, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer?
So what's the problem?
My home number's on the back...
Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner.
What about hard work?
I'll be right there, fix them a drink.
Sorry, Mr. Gekko.
Now, wait a minute, Dad...
What the hell do you want?
Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. Look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. Bring Darien...
Hello Bud.
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
So, how did your conference go with Gordon?
I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?
Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud!
I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes...
Hi.
How you doing Buddy?
Mr. Mannheim, got a sure thing.  Anacott Steel.
Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground.
What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne? Celebrate, just like the old times Sunshine.
You told him about us?
You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the "sir" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline...
We know what you're up to, Gekko, and let me tell you this from here,  you suck eggs, mister, over my dead body you ain't gonna break up Bluestar.
I saw the greatest movie with mark last night
He still likes you
Businessman?
Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
But?
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
And uh, your nicotine sir
Will you be wanting your wheels today sir?
I hope you enjoyed your visit.
Well?
I can't believe she went out with that monster last night
This time I really don't see anyone man.
No thank you sir we're fine.
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
You bet.  We all can't be such modern people 
I know that.
That was very good.
Besides, Dad would have freaked.
I started seeing things.
Did you?
What?
Why is he worried?
I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
How?
Of course.  You must be so proud.
For the Dupont Chair.  I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst.
Who?
You're the flower lady.
I've seen you.  From the window.
He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...
What?  What are you afraid of?
No, I don't.
He was so pissed.
She got it.  Turned it down.
You are?
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
Absolutely.
You think he killed her?
Know what I think?
Someone's there.
Place your fingers on the planchette.
Mef?  What's Mef?
What?
I don't know.
Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it.
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
Jody he was lying.
She's awake.
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
It's okay if you're not.
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
You did a great job.  She's a good kid.
Tired?
Did you...
Maybe we should just...
Did she say that?
Why?
Oh.
Yep.
And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..."
Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.
It's a flare.
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
Dressed?
Norman...
What are you doing out here?
Sabotage?
Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
You know I am.
We walked all night...
You dropped a glass.
It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not...
It's too rough.
Your wife...
It was last year.  We were having troubles.
Claire, please don't...
THAT'S NOT TRUE!  You wanted to quit!  And then when you did, you hated me for it... so you gave it all to her.
We have to get out of here.
Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -
With his hands!
I - r saw him as a child.  Lots of times...  But no one else did.
Don't tell Rowan about this.
Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
-Ellie said she died when I was BORN!  She's been alive...? ALL THIS TIME...? Why have I been lied to when -
She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her. Who gave you that right...?!
I don't want the -
He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.
And that is why I pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her...
Go back, MICHAEL... Go Back
Parents say he - uh - fell -
uh - then he - be just -
Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...
Made it...?
A girl...?
And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
You mustn't hurt him. Mustn't - mustn't hurt..
I do not understand...
Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?
Harder...
Harder...
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
You look very deep when you do that.  It's interesting.  We're Complete opposites-  I'd never just sit and wait for insparation.  I'd skip my turn and swap some letters.
Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H.  Yu-hee-yah...? No way, busters use it in a sentence.
Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -
I'm serious.  You don't -
Stop it.
I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute  In L.A., remember...?  He said he'd see you.  He was intrigned.
Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I -
Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans.  Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me.  I'll call you there.
She - she said I - I was a ---
It could've been a tornado - or a - a hurricane.  Maybe -
Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.
You're a ve-ry bad witch, you know that...?
You look a little green.
It's not some fairytale in an old book.    Michael - look at me.  I didn't choose this, Michael.  This is who I am.  I love you.
You alright...?
Is he - is he gonna die...?
Michael - why would he want to hurt Stu...?
When aid you get home last night...?
Something's wrong with you.
Lasher...  Where --- where is ---
On which planet...?
Wow...
A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville.  Oh, sweet decadance.
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
I thought it was 'whistle while you work.
We'd better get to work on the papers.
OH MY GAWD!
When could I look round?
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
This must be one of the old keys -
My names isn't ANGELA...
Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
What did you do with her?
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
How long have you been watching me?
What didn't you like about her?
No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.
I want it to stop - it all to stop...
What?
What's wrong?
ELLEN, would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot
I haven't been using it recently LESLIE
whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
Don't you want me now LESLIE
I'm sorry, I couldn't - when is she due?
Is LESLIE here?
It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you?
As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?
Just put it in my room
Dr STECKLER?
Dead?
ANGEL...
Someday, I'll find out.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
Who the hell was your father?
...A bouncer? Are you serious?
I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
So far away? In Xenia?
Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.
Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS.
I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck.
Never say never.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
You go first.
Well. The prom's coming up.
Hi, Teddy Bear.
I mean, what do you think?
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
Ted, it's your dad.  I have a question for you.  I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words.
Sorry I--
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.
Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.
Teddy, I thought we were having a moment here.
But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
I wondered about them, for so many years. I wondered if I looked like them, acted like them. I wondered why they gave me up.
I'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie has long been one of my idols.
James, what are you doing here?
Are they okay?
I miss them, too.
But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.
A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
I guess.
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
Considering this is your first time on a private jet, on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor,  you are extremely cavalier.
See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
Well? What do you think of her?
I see.
You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?
I mean my father.
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
I don't know. This place seems pretty tame.
A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo."
I want you to trust me.
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.
You think you're working with chimps here?
Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again.
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?
That's part of growing up, honey.
Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin.
Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?
I like you, Ted. You know that. I liked you before you were filthy rich.
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing.
I'm warning you.
The parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy. Which is seldom.
Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?
There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right?
You were the new and improved you.
You ARE home. But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I'll be your point person here on the magazine.
Don't forget to tell them all your qualifications.
I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books.  Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking.
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides.  That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.
Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.
How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?
The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers...
Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons?
How long?
Same as him.  They saw her come.  They saw her go.  They saw him follow.
This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.
Eliminate the competition.
Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.
Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you...
We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
She bit you?
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.
It's those rocks, up there.
You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
You are.
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.
Get off my property.
Is that Sam Lombardo?
My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.
You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...
Don't forget the car wash.
Where's the hose?  We can set up.
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
God, you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here.
I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
Say you love me.
Good thinking.
Forget it.
You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan.
There's nothing for them to get.
I just want my life back...
Where is she?
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.
Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
But she ran away.
Fuck you.  This is bullshit.  I'm outta here.
But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
How...
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
I can't, Sandy.  I've got to run.
Didn't you see her this morning?
Look.  I know you're seeing Barbara Baxter.  So what?
J. S. Bach.
Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.
Aha!
Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.
Never seen a gun fire so fast!
If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?
You might have mentioned you had that.
Can you fill me in here?
There's only seventy-eight.
It was in your book.
Are those just button buttons or...?
Well, we'll stay in touch... you know.
You didn't tell us you had this on!
Anyone?
Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
Look, I'm Captain James West...
Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
French?
We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.
The U.S. is my jurisdiction.
These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.
Now it's a bomb.
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
It's you they're after, Madmarti- gan.  What did you do this time?
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
Willow Ufgood.
You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen.
Sir!  I have to talk to you.
You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
Hey!  Somebody's coming!
Thanks for your help, Peck.
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
Fresh goat's milk.
Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!
Madmartigan, I need your help.
I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
I don't know, Willow.
I could be you rguard!  I could carry your spear!
Kill him!
Willow.  To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!
I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
What's the magician's weapon?
Ouch!!
Tir Asleen.
Time is running out.
I'm not going in there.
We gotta follow them.
She's hungry.
I'm getting her out of there!
This is not going well.
Talk!  Say something!
We've traveled a long way.  We're looking for Fin Raziel.
I've seen pictures.
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
Put my car in the garage and close the door.
Your hole is healed, then?
Tell you what  I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
Is it them?
Are they going to kill you?
Don't let them hurt you.
Have you got your gun on now?
How reliable is this kid?
You know who?
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.
You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer.
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.
How long?
Tell him his tea stinks.
Buttons are Hochmut.
But Stoltzfus said...
Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago.
You know carpentry?
What else can you do?
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.
You're so sure of that?
It's me.
I'm coming.
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
You know where he is.
Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him 
Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee.
I will be the judge of that.
What about Carter?
He'll live.
Get back in there.
Aunt Em!
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
No --
Yes.
Uhh -- yeah --
To see?
If she?
... -- Oz -- has spoken!
Oh --
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
Ahh!  Ah!
No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
...Toto, too?
Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right.  I -- you're -- you're going on a visit.  No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away.
Yes --
Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
That's right.  What's she doing?
That dog's a menace to the community.  I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have...
Oil can.....Oil can....
...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.
Oh --
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
A home --
Oh -- unusual weather we're having, ain't it?
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?
Supposin' you met an elephant?
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
Oh -- Oh, come on.
...don't talk.
Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
Um-hmm.
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
The other side....
I don't like this forest!  It's -- it's dark and creepy!
Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
Yes -- there --
Oh --
Oh -- Oh --
The ruby slippers!  What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll ---
Real courage. That's what we want.
Yeah.
What if it were a brontosaurus?
Would...would it do any good if I roared?
Here --   Come on.
Stop pushing!
Not even a rhinoceros?
From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.
...I -- I -- I hope my strength holds out.
...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
...Tin Man!
Beautiful!  What an echo!
Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
No, you don't.
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
Well --
Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.
Stop that dog!
They wont get far. Every warhead has a locator card.  A Miratom device.  Emits a high-pitched signal on Russian emergency frequencies. We can track the bomb.
The plutonium is missing.  Theyve taken the core!
What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
Do you know what youre doing?
Weve got to get out.
Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It wont just be two weeks out of action.
007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?
The report King bought. Its a manual. Renards men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.
Theyre getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I cant help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty.
Consider me ungrateful.
I havent been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I dont want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  Im not sure he knew that.
How long has he been with you?
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think Im a coward.
Then take me with you.
I dont want to be safe!
If this little show is for my benefit, Ill take you home right now.
Surely you believe in living dangerously.
What are you talking about?
Im coming with you.
You, of course. I need some information.
Really Bond, couldnt you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?
That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!
So.  My way.  No MI-6, no Interpol.  Just you, me and my people.
What?
Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didnt think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.
He was a...good lover?
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.
I'm here, Laurie.
Would you like me to stay?
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
Jon, I do not want to hear it.
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
Jon --
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
She's with me.
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan.
Im not.
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
Damn straight.
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean, if you need some aspirin, or --
The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
What happened?
I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
He's a little farther gone every time.
Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.  Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
Who the hell are you?
It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
Why is that?
Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
How about a pedicure as long as you're down there. What's this? Lo-Jack?
Up yours.
This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".
They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
We're on to the game, ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on, let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'.
What game is that?
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
Next we got a Siberian redneck, Viktor. Into snowmobiles and snowboarding. So naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade.
Like what?
If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
What's that?
What are you doing with the Ivans?
I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
Yorgi and Kirill.
Toadies right behind.
Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s.
Back off, just go away you klutz. Alright, here's the story. The items in these cases belong to me. I designed them, built them, and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up.
This is your standard dart gun.
From the Beastie Boys collection?
French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
I'll leave you two alone to talk.
Dude, what are you doing here?
I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
What's this?
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.
And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.
Including rape, pillage, murder.
I'll tell you one thing though.
Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge.  I'm taking her down.
Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?
I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?
If necessary.
You should always work with a spotter.
Logan, do you see this ring?
You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey.  Three words: Are mutants dangerous?
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
The intention of registration act -
What is it you intend to do to me?
What am I doing here?
I've found her, Westchester Mall.
Don't you knock?
What was your grandfather's name?
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
MMMmm!
So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
Darling!...you will be careful!?
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
Goodbye, darling.
Good night.
How long will this whole thing take?
I didn't do that.
One week at the most!?
I prefer, by far, to be remembered for my own small contributions to science.  Now if we can proceed to your questions.
In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
There.
I thought you wanted to.
The wockers with the knockers.
But what you were doing?
Do you have the name I wrote down?
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
Throw the second switch!
Throw the third switch!
What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.
Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
I'm a failure.
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
Come on, big fellow!
Get the sedative ready!
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
Would you like a sandwich?
Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!
Oh, doctor!
'As the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved to make the Creature of a gigantic stature.' Of course!  That would simplify everything.
Reputation.  Reputation!
What are you going to do?
It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...'
Nor to Elizabeth.
Yes...yes, you have yours.
All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?
Are you ready for me?
His what??
Another fifteen seconds to go.
Foooooood!
Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .
