<s> You're sweet.
<s> Is he oily or dry?
<s> You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
<s> Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
<s> Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
<s> Don't make me do it, man
<s> Who?
<s> I thought you were punishing me.
<s> Sweet love, renew thy force!
<s> We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
<s> Call them.
<s> I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
<s> Give me absolution.
<s> Then why?
<s> Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
<s> He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
<s> You're Polish?
<s> Better than one.
<s> Raw deal.
<s> I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
<s> Credit?
<s> You want the tape?  There it is!
<s> He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
<s> I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
<s> I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
<s> Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
<s> I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
<s> Yeah, I've been busy.
<s> Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
<s> No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
<s> I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
<s> Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
<s> You're done.  End of story.
<s> She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
<s> I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
<s> I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
<s> Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
<s> Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
<s> Luther's on the move...
<s> I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
<s> I'm heading out. How about you?
<s> Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
<s> When? How?
<s> Where is he?
<s> Not bad, not bad.
<s> You noticed...
<s> What is?
<s> Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
<s> I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
<s> I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
<s> I'm so tired...
<s> Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
<s> I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
<s> We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
<s> I love you.
<s> What's wrong?  Are you alright?
<s> Don't...
<s> Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
<s> Nobody saw you bring her in?
<s> I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
<s> Child pornography.
<s> Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> I can't find him.
<s> You could do worse.
<s> It's lonely in there, in my room.
<s> What do you think I'm doing?  Look.  Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back.  He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
<s> No shit.
<s> But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
<s> I have selected you, to return with me - along with several other specimens, for study.  We will examine you and the others, discover desirable features to incorporate in our 'earth-colonizers.'
<s> Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
<s> You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
<s> What is the Northcountry Development Association?
<s> Tell me.
<s> Shit.
<s> Yes.
<s> It ain't done, if that's what you mean.
<s> It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
<s> You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
<s> Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
<s> That's what you think.
<s> Jim... for godsake!
<s> Did we warn them off?
<s> why did they do that?
<s> Copy, Air Force One.
<s> Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
<s> Let me by, Elaine.
<s> Do you have an appointment, sir?
<s> Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
<s> Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
<s> ...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
<s> You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
<s> And still it fits?
<s> Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
<s> No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
<s> There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
<s> Ss'kya'ta'.
<s> Talk to me, Hudson.
<s> That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
<s> Well, thanks, I --
<s> Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
<s> Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
<s> Sorry to disappoint you.
<s> Maybe.  Maybe not.
<s> Look!
<s> Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
<s> Extremely clever.
<s> We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
<s> Oh, yes.
<s> Ah, now! Here she comes.
<s> Yes?
<s> In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.
<s> No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
<s> What is this?
<s> I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?
<s> Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
<s> Yes!
<s> Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
<s> I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
<s> Of course.
<s> Yeah, I do, but go to work.
<s> Pull over.
<s> Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
<s> Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
<s> Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
<s> This is too much. I can't handle this.
<s> We were attacked by a werewolf.
<s> Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
<s> That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day.
<s> Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
<s> It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
<s> Not yet, Mr. Clark.
<s> I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
<s> Why, I needed a
<s> Well, aren't you going to invite me?
<s> I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
<s> Where is he now?
<s> Were you in Cluett's apartment?
<s> I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
<s> Mine too?
<s> I hate to do this, but I've got to have time to dig up some help. I think I know where I can get some real cash. Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick this thing yet.
<s> Well, he was making love to her.
<s> Then where were you?
<s> I'm okay, Matt.
<s> Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it.
<s> What will be?
<s> Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
<s> Boys?
<s> "Hmm" what?
<s> Thanks.
<s> You been with a girl ever?
<s> I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
<s> Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
<s> Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
<s> No, he doesn't.
<s> Yes, naturally.
<s> No, you...didn't?
<s> See you then.
<s> When?
<s> Negative. Cancel it.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
<s> I'm on a diet. But thank you.
<s> Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
<s> Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
<s> You can't just walk in, either.
<s> I went to see the Skywire model in Gary's office. You know. Just to hold it again.
<s> I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.
<s> It's gonna get cold.
<s> 'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
<s> Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
<s> Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
<s> You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
<s> What?
<s> He doesn't know about the Day Care.
<s> Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
<s> I'd rather talk about Number Two.
<s> Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
<s> Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.
<s> Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
<s> Yes.
<s> Silence!
<s> Thank you, Herr Doctor.
<s> You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
<s> You don't say. How real does it feel?
<s> ... preserve...
<s> Valentine, listen to me ...
<s> For a man in my position --
<s> I meant me.
<s> Have you any place in mind?
<s> But how can I do that?
<s> You better not have too much joy.
<s> Gonna get married...
<s> Can't I just go with you guys?
<s> You're so romantic...
<s> This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
<s> I'll take some.
<s> What do you mean, it changes?
<s> This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
<s> Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!
<s> The phone made me do it!
<s> If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
<s> Still drawing a blank.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Maybe I did... I don't remember.
<s> My Lt. might have something to say about that.
<s> Thanks for the speakers.
<s> Thanks for the insight.
<s> So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
<s> I don't have the slightest idea...
<s> I don't have a story.
<s> Pest control.
<s> Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.
<s> "Don?"
<s> Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
<s> I'm a Catholic.
<s> I think of running for help, and falling to my knees in prayer.
<s> You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me.
<s> Exactly!
<s> What's a Negro.
<s> We all stick to this, it's smooth sailing.
<s> Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
<s> Good morning.
<s> On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
<s> To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
<s> You're lying --
<s> Maybe --
<s> Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
<s> The very same.
<s> I plan to grow on you.
<s> And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
<s> You wanted to get the truth.
<s> It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.
<s> Good, just making sure.
<s> Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
<s> That's great.
<s> I brought it.
<s> I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
<s> I have the rest of my life to find out.
<s> Did you?
<s> Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
<s> Of course.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Uh... Yes.
<s> I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me.
<s> You...
<s> What?
<s> Well I don't...
<s> What'chu sayin'?
<s> So he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  You think he's crazy for thinkin' that?
<s> Not a prayer.
<s> What's the problem here?
<s> You can trust me.
<s> Why's that?
<s> It's my last shot.  I have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
<s> No one's keeping him here.
<s> What about E.M.S. recombination?
<s> Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.
<s> Do you recognize any of them?
<s> You mean a woman?
<s> I don't have one.
<s> I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.
<s> Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
<s> My Mom and Dad.
<s> Everybody's divorced.
<s> See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
<s> The front door is open.  Will you be back?
<s> Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
<s> And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
<s> Uh, I think they have.
<s> Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
<s> Would you like a tranquilizer?
<s> Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
<s> I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
<s> Give it back to him.
<s> You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
<s> No, it's not Don.
<s> Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
<s> I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
<s> Oh he forced you, huh?
<s> FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
<s> I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
<s> Look, it can wait till Sunday.
<s> No way. I'm about to blow up.
<s> Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
<s> Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us.
<s> We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
<s> Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
<s> You feel?
<s> Did that hurt?
<s> It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
<s> I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
<s> See you, Bob.
<s> It seemed like a good idea at the time.
<s> I thought your parents were in Italy.
<s> Yes. I did.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I can't do that, Bob.
<s> Yeah?
<s> What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
<s> They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
<s> You killed them.
<s> Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
<s> I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
<s> What's that?
<s> Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
<s> What?
<s> Are we hacking or asking?
<s> You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
<s> He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
<s> You are. And I'll come again.
<s> Every man dies. Not every man really lives.
<s> I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
<s> How long will I be in here?
<s> Shit. I knew you were crazy.
<s> Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
<s> Huh?
<s> Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
<s> Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
<s> Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
<s> Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
<s> That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
<s> You're such a retard!
<s> Well, so long.
<s> And the other alternative?
<s> -- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
<s> I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...
<s> Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
<s> Because you're getting on that plane.
<s> Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
<s> I love you very much, my dear.
<s> And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
<s> Good day.
<s> I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
<s> If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
<s> You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo?
<s> Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
<s> Take your hands off me!
<s> Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in, and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar.
<s> That new roof, that's your doing.
<s> This is my home.  I'm part of the wallpaper.
<s> The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
<s> Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
<s> Daddy, *please*...
<s> I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
<s> Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
<s> The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
<s> You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
<s> I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.
<s> My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million.
<s> We sure Big Al threw him to us?
<s> Alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second. Is this the best thing to do?
<s> We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
<s> And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.
<s> What? No. Use the bathroom on the plane!
<s> You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
<s> You're just going to have to trust me.
<s> Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
<s> You going to have the time?
<s> Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
<s> Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we...
<s> I don't know.
<s> You're talking about complicity.
<s> Does he win?
<s> I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
<s> I like to keep it professional, that's all.
<s> Later.
<s> Girl's gotta make a living.
<s> Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
<s> People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
<s> How's this about me?
<s> Not right now?  Okay, when?
<s> Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
<s> She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
<s> Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
<s> What? That's disgusting!
<s> Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.
<s> Plenty, but it was all bad.
<s> And if it ain't cleaned off?
<s> What's gone?
<s> I'm really sorry about that, man.
<s> Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
<s> Not if I shoot first!
<s> Where is she?
<s> I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
<s> It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
<s> Where are we going?
<s> It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
<s> Because you tell Mom everything.
<s> Beg pardon?
<s> But now you can't go.
<s> You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
<s> Loretta, never have kids.
<s> They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
<s> You could be quiet.
<s> Come on! Hankey here can't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse rat!
<s> "My dear President"...
<s> "My"...
<s> I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
<s> I wanna powder my nose...
<s> In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
<s> All right -- I'll go out and find one.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
<s> Oh, your Excellency, you take me off my feet.
<s> WHAT  ?
<s> You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --  Not bad, eh?
<s> I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?
<s> But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
<s> Yes?
<s> I intend to.
<s> Everything will be seen to.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> Do you think they'll go along with us?
<s> I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
<s> I don't know what I've got.
<s> Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
<s> Oh no?
<s> Say "Mmmerrick."
<s> Hello, my name is John Merrick.
<s> Yes, very soon.
<s> Welcome home, John.
<s> Why?
<s> Goodbye, Aud...
<s> I'm sure it's lovely.
<s> I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.
<s> I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
<s> Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
<s> I've got you!
<s> Well... I... I thought...
<s> No! It's YOU, Loki! I should never have listened to you!
<s> You liar!
<s> She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
<s> Why?
<s> I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
<s> It's three.
<s> ...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
<s> I don't want to talk about this here.
<s> I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
<s> Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
<s> I know.
<s> Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
<s> What are you doing?
<s> Tomorrow?
<s> Well, you obviously don't know me.
<s> That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
<s> And what are you like? A wino?
<s> I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
<s> Oh! Great. That's great!
<s> Sorry. I just --
<s> Well, what should we do?
<s> Patrick, we're in the middle of --
<s> Thanks, Stan. I owe you.
<s> Easy come, easy go.
<s> Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
<s> Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
<s> Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
<s> Nothing. It's nothing.
<s> The crew? Could they still be alive?
<s> Do you know what a singularity is, Miller? Does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is?  It is NOTHING. Absolute and eternal NOTHING. And if God is Everything, then I have seen the Devil.  It's a liberating experience.
<s> I'm not the Devil.
<s> That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
<s> "...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
<s> I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale.
<s> Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
<s> Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
<s> I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
<s> Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
<s> Are you kidding?
<s> Maybe yes. Maybe no.
<s> It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
<s> Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
<s> All right. Pay attention.
<s> All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
<s> Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
<s> What class?
<s> Yes.
<s> Aloha, Spicoli.
<s> Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
<s> Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
<s> I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
<s> Not where we operate.
<s> You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!
<s> I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done.
<s> Right. Sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops.
<s> I could already feel the stuff working on me -- the first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrine -- maybe I should take a swim, I thought...
<s> Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
<s> Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!
<s> They'll get in! We'll all die!
<s> Yeah.
<s> But it's got teeth.
<s> Follow me.
<s> Just cover me. It was built to move.
<s> F-f-fuck you.
<s> No bullshit.
<s> Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
<s> Nothing, just lookin'.
<s> GO-GO-GO!!
<s> I don't know who she fucked to get where she is, but I don't think it was me.
<s> As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
<s> I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
<s> Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
<s> Fine!
<s> Mama, what's...
<s> What's wrong?
<s> I have!
<s> You didn't say 'Symington says'.
<s> She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me."
<s> There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
<s> Materials. Nothing more.
<s> Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
<s> Elizabeth. My more than sister.
<s> I'm all right. I'm safe,
<s> A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
<s> Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
<s> Here we go.
<s> Don't get up. Take a second...
<s> Good call.
<s> I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
<s> Lead the way!
<s> Rocky Road.
<s> So do I just follow you?
<s> He's running the show.
<s> I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
<s> Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
<s> These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
<s> Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
<s> He needs our help!
<s> So I'll get a fair shot?
<s> I find this as distasteful as you, lieutenant.  But if it's on my desk, it's on my shoulders.  There's going to be an inquiry -- it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty.  You should prepare yourself.
<s> Check your watch, Pyro.  Seems fast.
<s> "Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no matter how long."
<s> You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
<s> That's a good story.
<s> Mighta been civilian.
<s> It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore.
<s> 15, sir.
<s> Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?
<s> No.
<s> Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
<s> He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
<s> Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
<s> I'm... I'm shot.
<s> Yes Commander?
<s> Never mind, Fred....
<s> It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
<s> Congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions.
<s> The British Army is right back there, across that river!  Sir!  I think it must be something else that detains General Lee.
<s> I only meant...
<s> Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
<s> Some things must never change.
<s> Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.
<s> They all sound big at the talking stage.
<s> I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
<s> Leo spanked a waitress?
<s> You just did.
<s> They always paid.
<s> She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades.
<s> I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
<s> Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
<s> I'm thinking about producing.
<s> Bring it on, dude.
<s> Sounds reasonable.
<s> We'll stand a watch. Four on, eight off. Low man first.
<s> Murphy.
<s> You better get down here right now! We're taking water! Big time!
<s> Hey.
<s> We'll have to take it easy then. I don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around.
<s> Leave it.
<s> Who?
<s> It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out.
<s> Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
<s> Oh my God, that's HIM!
<s> Somewhere downtown.
<s> Don't worry.
<s> I said "great"...
<s> I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
<s> I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
<s> Oh, right...
<s> It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
<s> Look, what do you expect?  Considering how we met you.
<s> So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
<s> Why don't we start with that next week?
<s> As are they all.
<s> You never had it.
<s> You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -"there."
<s> Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there.  Take the others to the water tower for the night.
<s> Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
<s> I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
<s> Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
<s> Okay, let's take a look.
<s> No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
<s> I know.
<s> I await the word of Vigo.
<s> I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
<s> And it's all flowing toward the museum.
<s> I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
<s> Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
<s> Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
<s> We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
<s> Huh?  What?
<s> No, I just thought --
<s> Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
<s> Thank you.  Next time I want to break a lease I'll know who to call.
<s> Talk to my accountant. 
<s> We'll get back to you.
<s> No, you may not.
<s> A square?
<s> What is it?
<s> God, it's ugly!
<s> Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
<s> What do we do now?
<s> My parents left me that house, I was born there.
<s> Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
<s> If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
<s> Yes?  Go on!
<s> I can't let you do that.
<s> Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
<s> I want nothing to do with the arena.
<s> No.
<s> Get out of here.
<s> You've got to tell me what she said.
<s> Shhhh.
<s> Mr. McQuire.
<s> What?
<s> Will you unzip my dress?
<s> Isn't there something you want to tell me?
<s> Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
<s> Well?
<s> Think real hard, Benjamin.
<s> Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
<s> I'd like to hear it.
<s> It's Benjamin.
<s> Why?
<s> Oh -- work!!
<s> Where downstairs?
<s> Of course.
<s> For tonight. 
<s> I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
<s> Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
<s> Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --
<s> General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
<s> Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
<s> Don't do that. 
<s> Everything?
<s> Can't you understand me?
<s> Don't worry about me, Mr. General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself.  There has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four.
<s> Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
<s> Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
<s> Fair enough.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> ) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
<s> I have to have that money, Roy. What do I have to do to get it?
<s> Every day in every way.
<s> Because it's comfortable.
<s> See you soon.
<s> Upstate where?
<s> Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... 
<s> Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
<s> Just get on the bus.
<s> John, you can't help her now.
<s> I did alright.
<s> You mean Tommy.  Yeah, on the weirdness scale he's about an eleven.  Supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed up his head.  He's harmless, though.  Probably just lonely.
<s> Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
<s> But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
<s> But I've seen him!
<s> Really?
<s> The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
<s> You've come to the right man.
<s> They're not engaged.
<s> It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything.
<s> Almost a Christmas scene.
<s> It's always locked.
<s> I've literally got to run!
<s> You were wrong, you quack!
<s> Now who's being cruel?
<s> You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
<s> That man is your father.
<s> It is you, isn't it, Harold?
<s> Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
<s> What?
<s> Tonight's the night.
<s> He's not your son.
<s> You may do that in the privacy of your room.
<s> She thinks so.  What do you do?
<s> Well, next time you talk to him, tell him to pay his actresses more.
<s> Last I heard he went to San Diego.
<s> I don't drink, but you can go out.
<s> It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?
<s> Who made it?
<s> Get out!
<s> It's just a name.
<s> Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over.
<s> No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
<s> They don't know. They were having some recreation deal out at Knott's Berry Farm and Kristen wasn't there when they got back to the bus and they couldn't find her.
<s> Is this with a girl named Kristen?
<s> Who's that?
<s> You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
<s> Oh, I don't have one.
<s> You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
<s> No, thank you. I have my car.
<s> What?
<s> That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
<s> Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?
<s> Yes. They're old friends.
<s> We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
<s> Can't complain.
<s> Well, actually, it was the name of my drama teacher - Louis Sunshine. Perhaps you've heard of him. He was such an influence on the development of my instrument. That means my body - in theatre talk. Well, when I came to Hollywood I felt the need to express the emerging me in a new form, so I took on "Sunshine." Dore is my real name... Well, Dore, actually. My, what a lovely place you have here.
<s> Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
<s> I wouldn't say "benefit."
<s> No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
<s> Oh, yes. How did you like that?
<s> Perhaps you're teasing us. Are you teasing us?
<s> Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
<s> Those things never work. Never.
<s> Don't know. Really. I grew up with him.  I've missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now, I feel he's here --
<s> I could lead you right to him. You could take him back to Hell instead of me.
<s> No. That wasn't the deal.
<s> I don't want to see the dress.
<s> You mean we're moving in?
<s> I hear you.
<s> Sure.
<s> Not much.
<s> You will keep in touch.
<s> I've forgotten.
<s> Finished?
<s> Ehh.
<s> But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
<s> Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some.
<s> We work there!
<s> Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
<s> Can I help you?
<s> Fine.
<s> I haven't felt like it.
<s> Hi.  What are you doing?
<s> That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
<s> I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
<s> Would you marry me if I was?
<s> What difference does it make?
<s> Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
<s> It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
<s> Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
<s> Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
<s> Okay.  Because you took the trouble to come up here.  And because you've got principles.  But that's it.  I'm not selling them to you one by one.
<s> It's my birthday.
<s> You're a fool.
<s> They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
<s> Must he go?
<s> Won't know till the records department comes back with it this after- noon.  Looks good though. They found the receipt in his townhouse.  It was pretty smeared but had Taupin's father listed as a signatory.
<s> Should I care?
<s> It doesn't have to rhyme!
<s> Au revoir, mon capitaine.
<s> You got it back, eh? There's something funny going on around here.
<s> Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
<s> Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
<s> What the devil do you want? Listen, Bruce, you can't come in here now! We're busy!  Where you been, Duffy? Stick around! What? What Chinese earthquake? The deuce with it... what's that?
<s> She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
<s> You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
<s> Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
<s> Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
<s> I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
<s> This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
<s> How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
<s> But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
<s> Hello, Mollie.
<s> I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac, marching past.  Made my hair stand on end.  I thought, I've been asleep for twenty years.
<s> Propaganda. We've been had.
<s> Grace!
<s> ...since I used to take you to the Proms?
<s> I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese.
<s> Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
<s> I hope this place is cool. We could use something interesting to liven up chapter 12.
<s> What's that?
<s> Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always thought it was bullshit.
<s> Here he comes.
<s> It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
<s> Turn on the headlights. See if anything is out there.
<s> Yes. Happy happy.
<s> You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.
<s> Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
<s> Oh, Rosie.
<s> Shut up, you.
<s> What?
<s> I guess.
<s> Check!
<s> Cash.
<s> Yeah. Sure, sure.
<s> No, no. When you play for me, I pick up all the tabs.
<s> No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
<s> No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
<s> Approximately? One thousand bucks.
<s> Glad to meet you.
<s> How come you didn't catch your bus?
<s> Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours.
<s> The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
<s> What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
<s> Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
<s> This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
<s> This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
<s> Sure ... fine.
<s> May I ask why?
<s> Yes ... yes, but I'm not sure what I saw anymore.
<s> Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
<s> I thought you said you were doing to break it off.
<s> We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
<s> Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.
<s> Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
<s> Don't worry. He won't.
<s> I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
<s> After you, Junior.
<s> Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
<s> Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.
<s> Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell!
<s> Oh yeah?
<s> What?!
<s> Willie!
<s> What street?
<s> Yeah.
<s> If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
<s> You have to! Quickly!
<s> Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----.
<s> And don't let her know, either.
<s> Without what?
<s> You're talking to me.
<s> ...Naw. Made that up.
<s> Why'd you run off?
<s> You can say that again. What do we do?
<s> What?
<s> So we better get started.
<s> She was playing with my Pooh doll again...
<s> Yes, I'm afraid I did.
<s> No, no, we're fine...
<s> ..."ignition propensity?"  ...you understand any of this...?
<s> These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
<s> No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.
<s> Far as you go where?
<s> The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
<s> Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
<s> When should we do this?
<s> Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
<s> Meaning my house.
<s> Oh brother. Here we go.
<s> No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
<s> Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
<s> I don't want to eat!  And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.
<s> Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
<s> Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
<s> How about Cinderellaor a real hot love story?
<s> Oh, no!
<s> A black eye. 
<s> Whome?  Want to see me?
<s> Well, I'll be
<s> Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
<s> I'd like to sit with myuhwifeif you don't mind. 
<s> You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
<s> Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
<s> Maybe I have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, Susie.  You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people!  We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial here!  What the hell do we really got?  Oswald, Ruby, Banister, Ferrie are dead.  Shaw - maybe he's an agent, I don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.
<s> Pretty fast, wasn't it.  The way they let him go.
<s> I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.
<s> No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead serious.  And we're going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago.  How did you find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas that day?
<s> No, I did not.
<s> And then Sunday?
<s> Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
<s> There were admirals.
<s> There's nothing wrong with feeling a little scared, Jasper, Virginia. Telling the truth can be a scary thing.  It scared President Kennedy, but he was a brave man.  If you let yourself be too scared, then you let the bad guys take over the country, don't you - and then everybody gets scared.
<s> How many shots you say you heard?
<s> I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.
<s> I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
<s> If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.
<s> It's a contradiction, Numa, get used to them.  The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets.
<s> The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
<s> That's not what they're tellin' me.
<s> I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
<s> He called you?
<s> Sandra Bullock. You know her?
<s> I'm old enough to be her father.
<s> He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
<s> We get Ordell to come to my office. Nicolet -- is he already there, or does he come busting in while we're chatting?
<s> I'm sure.
<s> What the fuck is that shit?
<s> A Broadway shopping bag.
<s> Who's the other one?
<s> But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
<s> I never have. It's not my money.
<s> I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
<s> I sure hope you haven't done anything dumb Jackie.
<s> Do you got something for me?
<s> Got some o.j.?
<s> A woman.
<s> I can sit through it once.
<s> No.
<s> Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's ever been, anyway.
<s> Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
<s> You said five hundred and fifty!
<s> We went to the parking lot.
<s> Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world! Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker! The reason is, your ass ain't worth a shit no more!
<s> Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
<s> You go wait in the car. Wait a minute.
<s> I got some more business for ya.
<s> Hear what?
<s> He leave town?
<s> Just my luck.
<s> But the paper ...
<s> Goddamn it! I don't want a social worker. Carlson knows me.
<s> Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
<s> Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
<s> They're weird names.
<s> What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures?
<s> Stick with me, kid.
<s> It's over, Jake. It's all over.
<s> Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
<s> One drop?
<s> If you're lucky.
<s> Call my chiropractor.
<s> Last night! They were as real as you are!
<s> Why the hell we drivin' here?
<s> Oh God. I know. I know.
<s> Sergeant? We thought you were...
<s> I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
<s> Nanotechnology.
<s> We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.
<s> 'cause when we bought the house it was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the dogs.
<s> I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself...
<s> I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
<s> Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out.
<s> And I'll drink to yours.
<s> What?
<s> Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.
<s> No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
<s> But I'm going to give it up for adoption. I already found the perfect people.
<s> Really? Fingernails?
<s> Congrats.
<s> Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell!
<s> It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things.
<s> I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
<s> Yeah, downtown.
<s> Early! Stop!!
<s> Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
<s> To what? Virgins?
<s> Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
<s> No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends.
<s> Nothen' B.
<s> I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
<s> I don't know. I've never seen any of them before. Cornballs from Jersey on X. Feelin' the effex.
<s> I guess so.
<s> 15.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Yep.
<s> It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
<s> I was at the beach.
<s> We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
<s> If you got something to say to me, just come out and say it!
<s> Okay.
<s> There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?
<s> I'd say at least eighteen hours.
<s> Mate in five.
<s> Yes.
<s> I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.
<s> Colwyn.
<s> Hand over your dinner.
<s> Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
<s> And mine goes with you.
<s> Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
<s> With an old voice?
<s> OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
<s> Do you need money?
<s> Why?
<s> Yeah, what?
<s> No.  How far in one attempt -- what's the farthest someone like myself could walk?
<s> I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
<s> Mammoth.
<s> Maybe.
<s> It's mine to risk.
<s> Did you tell him everything you wanted to?  Did you do everything you could while he was here?
<s> What are my choices?
<s> Not really. My room's not far. The Whole Year Inn. You can drive with me if you want...
<s> How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
<s> I have to change and take a shower first. If you want to come home and wait.
<s> Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
<s> Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
<s> Yeah... I'd like that.
<s> I know! You helped me go from a six to a four!
<s> Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
<s> Thank you.
<s> You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I wasn't gonna --
<s> Yeah, luckily.
<s> Then we smash 'em?
<s> Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
<s> Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
<s> To be my bride, of course.
<s> Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
<s> Dance, Jack!  The night's but begun.
<s> I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
<s> Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
<s> Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
<s> What know you of fields of war?
<s> It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we?  For all the dark magic protecting it.
<s> Patience, lad.
<s> They'll do nicely.
<s> That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
<s> Let it.  Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
<s> Thought the weather terrible of late.
<s> He's here.  Check the bathroom.
<s> He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I'm not gay.
<s> Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
<s> You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
<s> You lied to me!
<s> A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
<s> Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
<s> No.  Mostly me.
<s> Who?
<s> So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?
<s> If I walk out the door, who's gonna be here tonight for the follow through?
<s> Someone stop her!
<s> Goodnight, Claude.
<s> He's right, Gibson. Put down the gun and we'll work this out.
<s> That's because I've never been here before.
<s> I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
<s> I can't wait to see that. You slay me, man.
<s> There are people down there having fun. I want to be one of them. I want you to be one of them. On Monday you can be a bank teller if you want, but tonight you're a bootlegger with a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and a fistful of cash.
<s> He does it all by himself.
<s> Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
<s> The hell you talking about? What train?
<s> No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
<s> What happened to 'em after that, Willie?
<s> I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
<s> Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
<s> The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
<s> The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
<s> "Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..."
<s> I love you.
<s> I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
<s> From? From? From?
<s> Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --
<s> Curious.
<s> You know.
<s> Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
<s> The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
<s> We'll remember. But that's a long time off...
<s> For as long as I can remember.
<s> They're comin' with us.
<s> His or ours?
<s> Dick can't be dead. Who told you he was dead?
<s> DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
<s> Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
<s> I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
<s> Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".
<s> It's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
<s> Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!
<s> I beg your pardon.
<s> Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
<s> It certainly is.
<s> Now you're irritating and absurd!
<s> Say, what about that gold deal?
<s> And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
<s> Are you the High Lama?
<s> I don't believe it! I can't believe it. She's lying.  You're lying. You're lying! Every word you've been saying is a lie! Come on, say it!
<s> You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
<s> Why, mother?
<s> All the time, sir.
<s> Me, too.  I feel a long day coming on.
<s> Do have any idea what I just said?
<s> You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
<s> It's all I could safely move.
<s> Yes, you did.
<s> I understand.  What's the other thing?
<s> I guess that's all of it.
<s> No.
<s> The what?
<s> I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.
<s> The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
<s> How?
<s> We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
<s> Shhh.  You know what I hear?
<s> Knott!
<s> Somebody's getting comfortable.
<s> Mommy's not home?
<s> Shhh. He'll hear you.
<s> We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then.
<s> Then what are you saying?
<s> He didn't say we need guns.
<s> Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
<s> Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
<s> Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
<s> Bobby and Ricky.
<s> Yeah. Me and my boy here are gonna be in New York overnight. I want you to pass the word around to the honeys back in business class that you all got plans for tonight. I'm talkin' a California style, Tupac, gangster pool party back at the hotel. And make that drink a double.
<s> Read it and keep on reading.
<s> Yes. Did you eat?
<s> You have to sleep for three.
<s> You put it very well.
<s> All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
<s> Well, bitch you move too slow.
<s> Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for size.
<s> I ain't doing bad.
<s> So what about him?
<s> Brothers of Brother Johnson.
<s> I don't know, but I know his face.
<s> [In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
<s> [You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
<s> [O.K. So tell me more.]
<s> Pinta...
<s> Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
<s> I'm a bargain.
<s> Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.
<s> Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
<s> Her beauty fucks with your mind.
<s> I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
<s> She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
<s> You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
<s> These are the worst years. I tell you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty- six years old. What am I to do with myself? I have strength in my hands. I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna make dinner for my children. Am I an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? These are the terrible years, Theresa! Terrible years!
<s> This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
<s> I like you. I like you. I been telling you all night, I like you...
<s> Please...
<s> Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy he can write.
<s> I heard you, Ma.
<s> The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
<s> Same here. You can retire my number.
<s> We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
<s> Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
<s> Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
<s> How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
<s> We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
<s> I don't get it.
<s> I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
<s> Yeah!
<s> The one and only.
<s> Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
<s> No.
<s> John! I'm so glad to see you. II was terribly worried.
<s> All set, Ann?
<s> Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
<s> Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
<s> It must be some kind of a gag.
<s> The elevators are still runnin'.
<s> Five thousand bucks!  I had it right in my hand!
<s> John Doe Club?
<s> Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery.
<s> Am I gettin' the car?
<s> Wait a minute, lemme see that.
<s> Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
<s> They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
<s> You've got the keys, send someone in --
<s> OUR SEMI-CONDUCTORS ARE DOWN!
<s> The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
<s> I am the crane, agile and sublime!
<s> I was calling yesterday.
<s> Like a party for all our friends.
<s> Didn't know you felt that way.
<s> I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
<s> But that's an hour's drive.
<s> The kid just called me stupid.
<s> Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
<s> I turned him down flat.
<s> That a Jew compliment?
<s> Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...
<s> My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
<s> Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?
<s> Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
<s> My <u>tail</u> itches.
<s> Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
<s> I just need to use the phone, lady.
<s> We like to think so, yeah.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Mm hmm.
<s> Goodbye, sweetheart.
<s> It couldn't be.
<s> You know--little worms--ambition.
<s> Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
<s> I said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--I appoint you to the United States Senate!
<s> Emma! Will you *please*--?
<s> Emma!
<s> Emma! I will not have conversations of this sort carried on by the children at dinner!
<s> I yield.
<s> No, Jeff--please--!
<s> Well--he's got nothing on me.
<s> Committee, huh?
<s> No complaints.
<s> Yes, sir--
<s> You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
<s> But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
<s> Yes, but I
<s> Yes.
<s> Don't be ridiculous.
<s> I don't know. I had to duck to get the story out. He was so far along he never even missed me.
<s> Okay.
<s> Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
<s> Well, maybe I will have a sandwich.  Do you mind waiting a few minutes?
<s> I'm a writer myself, you know.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Why's that?
<s> How do you mean?
<s> Now we're back on track.
<s> I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
<s> Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way...
<s> -- Go on!
<s> Be specific.
<s> Is that like a party trick?
<s> I don't know if --
<s> What was that?
<s> Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
<s> It's called pro bono.
<s> This --
<s> Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
<s> Everybody has a story, Skip.
<s> Holy shit!
<s> So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?
<s> It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
<s> Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'.
<s> I know my treasure.
<s> We're about to be shown the way.
<s> What did he mean?
<s> I saw him walk you home.
<s> Me, too.
<s> I just know.
<s> Mother... it's not what you think!
<s> The who?
<s> I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
<s> You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
<s> What is that?
<s> Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.
<s> I am afraid, then, I have to ask you both, Joseph as my brother, and Junot as my good friend, whether or not you know anything about this, or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it.
<s> I know.
<s> Lay down, Day-Day.  Stop moving.
<s> Yeah, I'm alright.  Is my face still orange to you?
<s> Go for it.
<s> Nothing.
<s> For what?  We ain't gonna have no house after the auction tomorrow!
<s> Let me talk to her again.
<s> No, that's,..that's fine
<s> On TV.
<s> Nods.
<s> I'm just an accountant.
<s> Keep it.
<s> Yeah, all right, listen...
<s> How do you mean?
<s> Tricked us!
<s> It's a shame!
<s> What's your name?
<s> I -- no, I --
<s> Ben never told you he throwed it in the river? Did he?
<s> Where's she at?
<s> Pearl and John.
<s> R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this --
<s> Dead and gone.
<s> Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
<s> As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
<s> Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?
<s> I think I need my glasses.
<s> Eight forty-two, sir.
<s> You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
<s> Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
<s> Certainly.
<s> Comrades, if we ring nine times... let's go in.
<s> What did she say about me?
<s> No, thank you.
<s> No visa.
<s> He takes good care of that.
<s> For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
<s> Ninotchka, I love you.
<s> It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
<s> A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm afraid madame and I will never agree.  The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. I understand everything will be over by Thursday. Am I right?
<s> I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
<s> Yes ... I got the money.
<s> I'm afraid we have another problem, Mr. President.
<s> So?
<s> Howard Hunt is working for the White House?  No shit!  This is goddamn Disneyland!  Since when?
<s> You never told him?
<s> Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me.
<s> Well, we'll lodge a formal protest.
<s> It could be '60 all over again, Edgar. Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn rock star.  They climb all over each other just to touch his clothes! He'll ride his brother's corpse right into the White House.
<s> She's quite pretty.
<s> When they know you've got something to protect, that's when they fuck you!
<s> One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum."  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.
<s> She must be very attractive.  Would she like an autograph?  She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
<s> I've missed you.
<s> Sometimes I think that's what you want.
<s> When?
<s> To what?
<s> Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
<s> The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
<s> Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
<s> I don't know...
<s> Sheriff?
<s> I'm ahead of you there.
<s> Okay.
<s> It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
<s> Well -- how come?
<s> C'mon, pack your things. Anything you leave you ain't gonna see again.
<s> You should be used to that.
<s> Yes ma'am?
<s> Hey.
<s> She'll be all right.
<s> Where does he work?
<s> Is Llewelyn there?
<s> Yes.
<s> Never mind.  I want a tent.
<s> That's not an answer.
<s> What product.
<s> He don't talk as much as you, I give him points for that.
<s> Twelfth Infantry Batallion. August seventh nineteen and sixty-six to July second nineteen and sixty-eight.
<s> That's right, you have the right to remain silent.
<s> No, Del.
<s> You're late, Eric.
<s> ...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on...
<s> Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there...
<s> ...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
<s> I know that.
<s> No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
<s> She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...
<s> ...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
<s> The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
<s> The law. Well the law is a human institution.
<s> Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett.
<s> Wait a minute - who elected you leader a this outfit? Since we been followin' your lead we got nothin' but trouble! I gotten this close to bein' strung up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied -
<s> We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Zack, you little shit! You haven't changed a bit!
<s> Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
<s> No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
<s> Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
<s> Well, I'll be goddamned.
<s> No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
<s> But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
<s> Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
<s> Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are we gonna do?
<s> Say fuck.
<s> Give me a break.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Man, fuck you!!!
<s> Party needs the bread.  Be hip to the struggle, only a dollar!!!
<s> N... N...... Not... Oh.
<s> I refuse to answer the question on the grounds it might incriminate me.
<s> We're like policing the police.
<s> A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
<s> Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
<s> He's not making light.
<s> And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention?
<s> Prisoner exchange.
<s> Probably.
<s> You're in no condition to ride.
<s> I should have killed him when I had the chance?
<s> Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
<s> Do you believe that?
<s> Does she love the cat?
<s> Because it's right.
<s> Wouldn't wash?
<s> Commodore, you can't do that!
<s> -- then we never would have met.
<s> -- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
<s> Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
<s> She must feel something for him. After all, she and I did create him.
<s> You better quit pushing me, pal.
<s> I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
<s> Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
<s> Jesus, Daniel.  It wasn't Ryker's Island.  It was work camp for white collar criminals.
<s> Once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure.
<s> If you don't want to do it this way, I can remove it surgically.
<s> I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
<s> What could happen?  I'm the plastic man, remember?
<s> Let's go.
<s> Can I help you, Mrs. Argon?
<s> I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
<s> No - give you another guess.
<s> Well, you could make this table a little - uh - a little less wide.  There is something you can do for me, Miss Schuyler.
<s> Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live
<s> Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
<s> That's ridiculous.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Now Mr. Smith, now please
<s> Well!
<s> Cut that out. Just because I'm married - there's no reason for that.
<s> Yes.
<s> Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
<s> Been where?
<s> It'll be ready in a minute.
<s> Sorry, boss
<s> The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
<s> Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?
<s> Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
<s> In my handbag.
<s> I'm sorry ...
<s> Thanks.
<s> Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me.
<s> You want to get out of here?
<s> What?
<s> Still doesn't make it right.
<s> Owns the hardware store.
<s> One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
<s> It's in your closet.
<s> You don't know?
<s> Rain.
<s> But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
<s> Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
<s> What do I MEAN!  You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...
<s> Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
<s> Hello everyone.
<s> -- all I want is the number of where she's staying and that should be god damn good enough, now stop treating me this way, please -- Just Give Me The Number Elizabeth Please Now I think I will kill you if you don't.
<s> So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
<s> Nothing, huh, do you know what I'm doing?
<s> I'm just laying on my bed.
<s> Are your pants off?
<s> Hey. What are you doing? How are you?
<s> See the thing is I could make it really easy on you -- I already have your credit card number, your information, address and stuff. This is so awkward asking like this, I'm sorry --
<s> Sure.
<s> It's Barry.
<s> You were talking about the promotion --
<s> I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
<s> We back our plungers 100% and we do ask for a 30 to 60 day display on the floor.....
<s> ....I have seven.
<s> You should go on a trip.
<s> No.
<s> Ok.
<s> I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think.
<s> His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.
<s> "Turn you out?"
<s> I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
<s> I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
<s> -- that was lust --
<s> Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue.
<s> -- then I've friends of my own to visit.
<s> No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.
<s> I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
<s> Yes?
<s> They've put you up to this, haven't they?
<s> No, when I was but a tender lad--
<s> She knew what she was signing on for After all, she took the money.
<s> How so?
<s> No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
<s> Orson. Stop. Just stop
<s> I expected more from you.
<s> And they went to the stockholders in New York.
<s> That's for me to decide.
<s> Get out
<s> So, on to the Life Of Christ!
<s> You know, like bang her or anything?
<s> I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
<s> Yeah, I know.
<s> I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
<s> "Father of the Bride."
<s> OK. Talk.
<s> What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?
<s> Are you drunk?
<s> Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
<s> Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
<s> All right -- you don't believe me.
<s> Who are you?
<s> That's good news.
<s> Something too frightful to utter.
<s> Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
<s> Not yet!
<s> I'm glad they let you out.
<s> What?
<s> They're still there!
<s> It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
<s> Man, you're schizoid!
<s> Mom--I'm not--
<s> No!  You're not tearing me loose any more.
<s> You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?
<s> She eats him alive and he takes it.
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> I feel as if I'm walking under water.
<s> Don't hurt him...
<s> -- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
<s> You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
<s> So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
<s> Part of... with them?
<s> I'm almost done.
<s> You said it a million times!
<s> Yes!
<s> And I worked there. For a year.
<s> Nothing... I promise-nothing...
<s> What's the code?
<s> There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
<s> It's a roach, guy --
<s> Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
<s> And you set me up.
<s> There is no other table --
<s> Was he all pissed off?
<s> Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
<s> This better not be some Freddy joke.
<s> Did the two of you talk?
<s> Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.
<s> Why am I Mr. Pink?
<s> Nice Guy Eddie.
<s> That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
<s> It's not good...
<s> I don't tip because society says I gotta. I tip when somebody deserves a tip. When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin' their job.
<s> I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
<s> Maybe it's better that way.
<s> You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
<s> You think you're so slmighty -- smart -- Who are you to sit up there and say nobody's good enough for you, like you said yesterday -- just because a man kisses a woman --
<s> Kind of sore.
<s> Nobody asked you to.
<s> Well, say it.
<s> I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.
<s> That's the end of the line.
<s> You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
<s> Oh, I wasn't worrying.  I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
<s> Oh, sure.
<s> In room "302" at ten o'clock?
<s> Oh.
<s> It's okay.
<s> Who?
<s> Let me see the files.
<s> Let me see!
<s> Oh Mom...
<s> Look officers! Life doesn't have to be ugly.  See the little birdie? Listen to his call.  Peter Pan! Peter Pan! Peter Pan!
<s> Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
<s> Marvin A. Pickles.
<s> I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
<s> But why? She's been ill --erratic, but I've never heard of anything like that!
<s> Not from me.
<s> We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything  and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.
<s> I wouldn't want to take them out. I just want to look at them.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Why?
<s> Please.
<s> I used to take great pleasure in that, being purposefully different, rubbing people's noses in it. Didn't you do that when you were younger?
<s> Kids? What about them?
<s> You had sex with you therapist?
<s> Yes.
<s> Ann Bishop Millaney.
<s> Sometimes. Afterward.
<s> Absolutely not.
<s> Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
<s> Possibly.
<s> Always the lawyer.
<s> We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out.
<s> Yes.
<s> But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
<s> Let me talk to him first.
<s> What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?
<s> I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened.
<s> I wish you hadn't done that.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
<s> Nick, you're so strange...
<s> Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
<s> Gonna cut me open?
<s> Used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did.  Cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants, gotta admit that.
<s> Jah -- you endorse his product -- He endorses your research.
<s> Now Betty, don't overreact.
<s> Of course.
<s> WHAT A JOKE...
<s> No.
<s> I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
<s> Oh, stop it. Make yourselves comfortable.  You boys hungry?
<s> They're just leftovers.
<s> Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.
<s> 100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
<s> It's going to be great. Here's to us.
<s> Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
<s> Deep.
<s> What's happening?
<s> You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
<s> Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying? I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. Not by a longshot.
<s> Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
<s> See you over there, Miles.
<s> About a year.
<s> The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
<s> Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
<s> I'm close.
<s> Where are we going to sleep?
<s> Rae, I need help.
<s> Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
<s> Thanks. That's what I call it too.
<s> No problem.  Do you want to come in?
<s> You really think so?
<s> Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
<s> -- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
<s> No, of course not!  Why?  Would you care if we were?
<s> Not quite.
<s> Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
<s> Frank, you know as well as I do, living in a fish bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media...
<s> That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
<s> She's at the premiere of "A Cold Day In Hell".  But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.
<s> I read.
<s> Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, Sayer.  Look it up.
<s> It's a yacht.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Tell me.
<s> He your best buddy?
<s> Oh.
<s> Yeah.
<s> They did?
<s> Dead people.
<s> Who!
<s> Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?!
<s> Who? Us?!
<s> What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
<s> Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
<s> Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
<s> You gotta admire the man's determination.
<s> How'd you know?
<s> This is Bandit I, come back.
<s> What they all want -- to handcuff a hero.
<s> Pick it up, Breaker.
<s> What's up, Dixie Chicken?
<s> That's the point, Dickey.
<s> Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
<s> GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!
<s> Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.
<s> -- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
<s> We're done.  Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him.
<s> Oh, that's a relief.
<s> Shut up.
<s> Yes.  But not until you mentioned them.  As soon as you said those things, I remembered them.  And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember.  It's like filling up.
<s> As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
<s> He is.  But he was here...
<s> How did you know?
<s> No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
<s> "To"... Forget about you.
<s> She bought it.
<s> Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
<s> Yeah, I think so.
<s> Peter Parker, you have no idea what I did this weekend.  Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way.
<s> I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
<s> Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
<s> Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
<s> Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
<s> See?  You big dullard.
<s> Let's talk in the hall.
<s> Just drop me off here.
<s> Yeah.
<s> It's on me.
<s> No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
<s> Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
<s> It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
<s> Please, please.
<s> Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
<s> Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?
<s> And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
<s> Nothing. As before.
<s> David --
<s> Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
<s> Oh, I'll have "Mr. Adventure" eating out of my hand. And I'll see you at the rendezvous.  All my hopes.
<s> Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
<s> 
<s> You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.
<s> Ah.
<s> This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim.
<s> Where <u>they</u> went. Saavik.
<s> There is some pain at first, I am told, and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end. That was what I learned from watching my wife.
<s> Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
<s> Let them eat static.
<s> Sir, we must!  We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere.
<s> Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
<s> Try the emergency channels...
<s> He wants to kill me for passing sentence on him 14 years ago -- and he doesn't care who stands between him and his vengeance.
<s> Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
<s> At least we know he hasn't got it. Just keep nodding as though I'm giving orders. Saavik, punch up the data charts of Reliant's command console -- hurry...
<s> Best speed, Scotty...
<s> Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners.  Captain.
<s> Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
<s> ... My shoes...
<s> Don't worry. I'll find <u>you</u>.  See you around the galaxy...
<s> You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.
<s> About 60 feet, Admiral.
<s> Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
<s> It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
<s> Arigato. Sayonara.  Thank you, honorable sir.
<s> Then you must spend your life answering questions.
<s> You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
<s> ... an offlander?
<s> No one's ever asked me that before.
<s> The artificial lifeform was right?
<s> Your Captain used to cut quite a rug...
<s> So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?
<s> If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
<s> Today is March second, 2063. The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five.
<s> Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.
<s> This is Picard. I've suspended the launch sequence.
<s> You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
<s> I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge.
<s> Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.
<s> Nothing.
<s> What are you suggesting?
<s> Vulcans sleep lying down...
<s> Chancellor Gorkon, can you hear me? Chancellor...?
<s> We're not finished.
<s> And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
<s> The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
<s> Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
<s> Where do we come in?
<s> Right -
<s> You hear that?
<s> I'm going to sleep it off. Let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.
<s> Probably trying to figure out why we're reversing, wondering if we detect her.
<s> Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?
<s> It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
<s> How could I not?
<s> Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
<s> I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
<s> I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. 
<s> On my way.
<s> Find her again.
<s> Don't... don't do this... please...
<s> Smile.
<s> Gas good?
<s> A drink.
<s> We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.
<s> This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
<s> Call the police!!
<s> It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
<s> Sure.
<s> I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.
<s> Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and say...
<s> You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. You know what's gonna come out of this... The end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. We could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. Don't you see that? Are you too stupid to see that?
<s> It was a man though... right?
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just answer one question.  Is anything wrong?  Iris said you might be in trouble.
<s> Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
<s> No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
<s> The gas tank's going to go any second!
<s> Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
<s> Not bad, huh?
<s> I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
<s> What?
<s> How long ago?
<s> In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
<s> They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
<s> Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
<s> I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
<s> Sex.
<s> But he believes in it. That's all that matters. He toyed with you, you toy with him. Convince him you've got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero, you'll find Low.
<s> Of course he does. Now get the key, get these things off me.  Unhook me.
<s> The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found.
<s> Yeah.
<s> ...and even then...
<s> No.
<s> ...Nah. I'm right across the street...
<s> Are you on the other line?
<s> Hey man, don't sweat it.
<s> Don't sweat it. Now I got an L.A. gun story. You should hear the way I tell to the guys back home. He had an Uzi. Mike half-smiles.
<s> Hey, man, you're not from here. You don't know how it is. I grew up in L.A...
<s> Believe me, I know what that's like.  Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?
<s> 213-555-4679. That's all. I just wanted to leave my number. I don't want you to think I'm weird, or desperate or something...  ...I mean, you know, we should just hang out. That's it. No expectations. Just, you know, hang out. Bye. 
<s> Hi, Nikki. This is Mike again. Could you just call me when you get in? I'll be up for awhile, and I'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all... 
<s> Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
<s> You're crazy.
<s> You won. There's nothing to be sorry about. You're a winner. I'm the fuckin loser. I should be sorry.
<s> What an asshole.
<s> That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
<s> I know she's coming back.
<s> Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
<s> Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like.
<s> What are you, a dance judge?  Go do your job; take a walk around the neighborhood... see everything is okay.
<s> I'll need him.
<s> Michael, why must you do this.  We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret.  It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa.
<s> Where are you going?
<s> You look good, too.
<s> That's for you to find out.
<s> No.
<s> No.  I want things very calm for another six months.
<s> It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
<s> Yes please!
<s> Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.
<s> Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
<s> Get on. I'll take you to him.
<s> Why do you have Dickie's rings?
<s> Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...
<s> May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiance?
<s> Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
<s> He'll, what else can I do with it all?
<s> Keep it.
<s> I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
<s> You forgot "sexy".
<s> With who?
<s> I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
<s> Ya want me to call da boss? Huh? That what you want?
<s> What did you do?
<s> We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
<s> It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 
<s> You want to work uptown nights?
<s> Physical? Criminal?
<s> Neither do I, I guess.
<s> Archbishop of Canterbury.  Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...
<s> Don't let him do that.
<s> Find the rockets.  If they're guarded, kill the men guarding them.
<s> Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.
<s> Well... where can we go?
<s> It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
<s> I do.
<s> By all means.
<s> Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
<s> The Bijou?
<s> Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did.  You've got to remember that.  You've got to.
<s> Sandra Sinclair.
<s> It's possible.  I just don't remember.
<s> Don't smell nothin'.  He must not be dead in here.
<s> So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers.  That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself.
<s> Yes.
<s> I despise it.
<s> I suspected as much.
<s> I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
<s> If your father were here...
<s> Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
<s> Right across the bay there.
<s> Okay.
<s> ...get away without thanking you in some small way. After all, you haven't even met Cathy and you are staying for the weekend...
<s> Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know that for a fact.
<s> Helping travelers.
<s> Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
<s> It was a woman when we put her in.
<s> Then all my surgery is no good. There's something wrong with the child -- something I don't know -- something I can't define -- can't diagnose.  I can do nothing for her.
<s> Bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg. If she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened.  So you're right, spooky. Happy?
<s> My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
<s> No! Why are you haunting me?
<s> I know.
<s> It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
<s> That can easily be arranged.
<s> We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately, we've been getting your television also.
<s> Thank you... Have you any news?
<s> Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
<s> Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.
<s> That's right.
<s> They would have killed this man?
<s> El Vampiro.
<s> I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.
<s> Mom!
<s> It's you I was after all along, Lucy.  To be our day time guardian. I knew if we could bring Sam and Michael into the faimly, there'd be no way you could say no.
<s> So do I!
<s> Nanook...
<s> Let's load 'em.
<s> I've got six dead Norwegians on my hands, a burned up flying saucer, and we've just destroyed the scientific find of the century.  Now fuck off!
<s> Finish what?
<s> Let go of me...
<s> Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
<s> Everything that's been missing.
<s> Can't hear you.
<s> It frightens you.
<s> A man can change his history.
<s> What?
<s> I need to... um... talk to you.
<s> Tonight's the night?
<s> You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
<s> I live with it every minute of every day.
<s> Why don't you come to our house instead?
<s> So you can use it now?
<s> Tell him to go away --
<s> I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
<s> Dean Fulton...
<s> Young man, we have a way of doing things here.  Radical theorizing is not acceptable.  Have I made myself understood?
<s> Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
<s> [Beat] What?
<s> It's December 25th, 1993 today.
<s> Then, where are you going?
<s> I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.
<s> What?!
<s> It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
<s> We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
<s> Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
<s> He implied it.
<s> I told you, her family moved to Miami.
<s> That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai.
<s> Jesus Christ you're right.
<s> 'That right?
<s> Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> Well, I'll see ya.
<s> Well, I know you're busy...
<s> I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
<s> Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter, and it wasn't me who sent it?
<s> Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.
<s> Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
<s> No, it's an old football injury.
<s> Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
<s> Oh great, I ran out.
<s> What --
<s> We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
<s> I'll be evacuated with the President.
<s> Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
<s> Who the fuck is he?
<s> Let's see it.
<s> She's that subtle?
<s> He also said "listen to the water."
<s> Likewise.
<s> And I don't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not, Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you.
<s> We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
<s> Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.
<s> Black Tail District, X22. You ready for this? Leo wasn't killed in the Badlands. I... I found the location.
<s> I'm with someone.
<s> Where were you?
<s> You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.
<s> True.
<s> But I have to!
<s> Well what?
<s> Who's your pilot?
<s> Nothing...That's McGown...that's Singer, isn't it? GOOSE Turn around, pay attention. What are you doing?
<s> Come on, relax...
<s> Yes sir.
<s> Come on...put his head in place.
<s> Yes, you do.  That's why we brought you here.  --  Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain.  And Kuato's  gonna dig it out.
<s> Up to the right.
<s> Bye.
<s> Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!
<s> All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me.
<s> Aliens built it.
<s> Of course not.  If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.
<s> What?
<s> You bet.  You gonna be staying up here?
<s> Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
<s> He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.
<s> That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
<s> Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.
<s> What?
<s> Right. You're right.
<s> Ossining Correctional Facility. Sing Sing. Everybody's innocent there, man... Just ask 'em...
<s> Easy? No... We have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.
<s> ...What do you mean?
<s> When I joined up I took an oath of secrecy. I told you what you needed to know.
<s> Good. Now we're going to take an affadavit from you, but only concerning the facts of the Chinatown shooting. We honestly don't give a shit about the Kennedy assassination.
<s> Y-yes, sir.
<s> No, s-sir.
<s> Calls for speculation.
<s> What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
<s> That's why we're here, Sheriff Cable. Where's the body?
<s> Was there an argument?
<s> Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
<s> But Bob isn't real.
<s> What? She asked about my father?
<s> I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
<s> Why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, Harry?
<s> It's a school night... back by nine.
<s> Not really.
<s> No.
<s> As far as we know, nothing.
<s> What did these people do when her heart stopped?
<s> ...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
<s> I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
<s> Yes. It was, actually.
<s> What is that to you...?
<s> ...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...
<s> We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
<s> I can't talk now.
<s> The 'History'...?
<s> Would you like some coffee, General?
<s> It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
<s> Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?
<s> We did.  Bad mistake.  The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right?  Anyway, a while back we got a call from Wes.  He's got this idea.  And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator?
<s> He's very excited about it.
<s> No...
<s> Read me some?
<s> Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
<s> That's what they get for not locking the door.
<s> I know.
<s> I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
<s> Your cannons made a compelling argument.
<s> As you can see, there's a lot to do.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> No.
<s> What?
<s> I can't.
<s> Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket?  Lost everyone on board.  In fair weather no less.
<s> Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
<s> Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.
<s> The real joke is we never went fishing, but we're still fishing.
<s> Just some guys I met here... I keep seein' 'em...  Now tell me...
<s> See ya downstairs.
<s> I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
<s> That's good... Now go get yourself a beer.  You fellas have alotta the same power Elvis had... Y'all know this one?
<s> She got me an abortion...
<s> Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
<s> Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin' my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.
<s> It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
<s> That'd be good, Lula.
<s> Yeah?
<s> I know this ain't easy, Lula, but I ain't gonna let things get no worse, I promise.
<s> He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
<s> Damn!
<s> Shoot him.
<s> Yes.
<s> Life is unpredictable.
<s> Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
<s> Shit.
<s> Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
<s> Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
<s> So is my friend... is Sara still here?
<s> Stop calling me Vernon.
<s> I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't know how anyone actually walks in these things.
<s> Is the thing -- is it over?
<s> No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
<s> About the baby.
<s> I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong...
<s> James is... I don't know...
<s> Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind?
<s> I might have his number on campus.
<s> It wasn't like that.
<s> Mariners are pounding the shit out of the Tigers.
<s> Sure.
<s> Why don't you just tell me?
<s> I'm adjusting okay.
<s> That was a joke.
<s> I'm not that crazy.
<s> Is this the first one?
<s> Yes, a nap. Kids do that. You ever take a nap, Rosen?
<s> Are you okay?
<s> You think I have a problem?
<s> Calm down, Bud.
<s> Not us.  Not human.  Get it?  Something non- human, but intelligent...
<s> You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
<s> Bud, it's the pressure.  Try to concentrate. Concentrate on my voice.  Just listen to my voice.
<s> But you just said that a month was too...
<s> It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
<s> Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
<s> How should I be ... arrogant?
<s> And why haven't they left each other?
<s> Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything.
<s> Rather than being so occupied with my thoughts, you would have been better off trying to understand what Anna was thinking.
<s> I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
<s> I deserve it.
<s> But what's gotten into you?... We would have known. Sandro must be out in the garden somewhere, taking a breath of fresh air, or watching the break of dawn. It would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type.
<s> And where do you find the models?
<s> Who tells you these things?
<s> I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
<s> Martha Louise Livingston.
<s> A mistake...
<s> I'm afraid.
<s> Yes I am.
<s> As much as Mother Miriam does?
<s> Are you ill?
<s> What do you do?
<s> Yes.
<s> You got to be crazy.
<s> Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
<s> Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
<s> When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
<s> There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
<s> Listen to her singing.
<s> No, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins.
<s> Sorry.
<s> I've got you worried, haven't I?
<s> Ah, go on, you swine.
<s> Hello the income tax have caught up with us at last.
<s> Sit down, the lot of you.
<s> Tonight? We can't make it ...
<s> What have you heard?
<s> I'll see what I can do.
<s> I don't know... I'm getting these <u>CRAMPS</u>!
<s> <u>OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD</u>!
<s> We have to avoid injuring it.  What we really need is some electric animal prods.
<s> Damn it!  How long to fix?
<s> Right.
<s> I hope not.
<s> How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead.
<s> At least it can't get up here now.
<s> How many?
<s> It was horrible -- horrible.  Like a chicken.
<s> What is it?
<s> Is it still dripping?
<s> No -- that's atmosphere.  Cloud layer.
<s> I don't even know what I'm looking for.
<s> Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
<s> Go ahead, Jay.
<s> But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
<s> Nooooo!
<s> Has anybody talked to them?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Compensate!
<s> Ackland?  I don't know him well enough to say.  If we were back on Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure. There's not much we can do out here.
<s> Don't wait for me!
<s> Yeah, exactly.  Those're pre-programmed course adjustments you're looking at.
<s> You can have one at Max's.
<s> And who remembered it? Who was there on the dot, at twelve midnight...?
<s> The reading could have been better, but you said it - now "many happy returns of the day..."
<s> Groom.
<s> I told you a lie. We'll make it easily. Margo's got no more conception of time than a halibut.
<s> If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
<s> Check.
<s> - everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...
<s> I'm a human being, I've got some!
<s> Then you listened as if someone else had written you play - whom did you have in mind? Sherwood? Arthur Miller? Beaumont and Fletcher?
<s> Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
<s> --they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
<s> --he said John Haldeman, not Bob Haldeman--
<s> We've just been talking to Young--
<s> I never worked for Sloan or Stans.
<s> Who were they?
<s> Then Barker withdrew the 25 thousand in hundred dollar bills and gave it back to Liddy who gave it back to me and I put it in the office safe which was crammed.
<s> Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
<s> --I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
<s> The slush fund at CREEP financed the ratfucking, we've almost got that nailed down, so--
<s> Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
<s> Haldeman too?
<s> Government. Recently retired.
<s> ...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
<s> I did all right on McCord.
<s> One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
<s> Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
<s> Charming.
<s> So Oz, you almost made it, huh?
<s> That's nice.
<s> Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
<s> No.  I'm missing the game for you.
<s> No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
<s> Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
<s> It's not what it looks like!
<s> That's great.  Now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it --  "Stroke the salami!"  Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We <u>all</u> masturbate.
<s> I know.  Hey Nadia.
<s> Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
<s> Come on, Kevin.  Vicky's looking for you.
<s> Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it.  Way to go, Kev!
<s> What was I gonna do, call dad?  I don't even know his number.
<s> Oh no... no....
<s> How well did, er, do you know him?
<s> He says -
<s> Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
<s> Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
<s> Nice car.
<s> Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
<s> so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
<s> Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!
<s> No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
<s> I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
<s> Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
<s> Don't get upset!
<s> ...of possibly working together.
<s> It was a wonderful set.
<s> To dander.  Otis.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Just do what I say, alright?
<s> Beats a lawsuit.
<s> Really?
<s> I'm worried about my spine.  I'm very worried about my brain and my spine.
<s> Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
<s> And you know, he really does not.
<s> And your phone calls are nasty and abusive.  And I've come this close to suing you for harassment.  And you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you.
<s> Let's just go home, okay?
<s> You fucking cow, can't you read?!
<s> Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of research.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yes.  Fine.
<s> At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.
<s> She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.
<s> Neither does Joe.
<s> Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
<s> It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
<s> Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
<s> Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
<s> You did?
<s> Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
<s> I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!
<s> Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
<s> Maybe I'll get lucky.  You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...
<s> Oh.
<s> Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.
<s> They had to pump it out.
<s> That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
<s> Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
<s> A what?
<s> No -- just come as you are.
<s> I don't?
<s> Gas?
<s> That's right, Mr. Sheldrake. I won't be needing it -- because I'm all washed up around here.
<s> So long, fellas. Drop in any time. The door is always open -- to my office.
<s> Yeah.
<s> It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
<s> We didn't talk about it -- you did.
<s> Stop that, Fran.
<s> The nerve.
<s> Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
<s> Bob WHO? -- all right, so we'll watch it at the apartment. Big deal.  Baxter? It's okay for Thursday.
<s> What's it matter? Get to the point.
<s> That's right, sir -- I come from New Orleans -- I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It's what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.
<s> Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy mag, man -- I mean like he was there when it arrived -- He just knew.
<s> Ours.
<s> Looks like a two thousand pound to me. Yeah, a two thousand pound bomb.
<s> Hairy ?
<s> So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here.
<s> You get to know each other pretty well out there.
<s> No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him.
<s> We'll be needing some supplies and fuel -- do you know anybody who can give me a hand?
<s> Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
<s> 28   CONTINUED:
<s> Yep.  Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
<s> Too bad.  We'd be out of here in a few hours.
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
<s> Dancing?
<s> Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
<s> Never.
<s> I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
<s> Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
<s> Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.
<s> I forgot to lock the door.
<s> I'd love to sit in that jury.  Send that S.O.B. right to the chair.
<s> No fucking way.
<s> I'm part of the game, just like you.
<s> As in daughter of Agamemnon?
<s> Several.
<s> But he won't shoot you right then?
<s> Sounds pretty well figured out.
<s> I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
<s> No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
<s> When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
<s> And not even then sometimes.
<s> Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
<s> 42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast.
<s> I'm not hungry, really.
<s> We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
<s> A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
<s> What for?
<s> Not all of them!
<s> No problem, is it at your place?
<s> You don't miss a thing.
<s> Yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
<s> That I want you to take me home.
<s> Like what, sir?
<s> I want to come back.
<s> When do I get time for me?
<s> The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be the day I win a million dollars... What's the matter, Biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?
<s> Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise?
<s> Seventeen.
<s> Have we ever met before?
<s> But he didn't ask me.
<s> What drill?
<s> Saturday night's the 'Springtime in Paris' dance. I'm taking Suzy Parker.
<s> What do you call this? 
<s> Yeah. I can imagine.
<s> I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
<s> Garland, it's me.
<s> Okay. I'm just having trouble getting started. It's funny, I'm blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what's expected 
<s> Not big in the sense of large  although it's that too. I mean important. This may be the most IMPORTANT work I've done.
<s> When did you start drinking again?
<s> What do you want from me, Catherine?
<s> I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.
<s> I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
<s> No.
<s> Nope. She did.  Like I say.  It never panned.
<s> What are you doing here, Pop?
<s> You want a drink?
<s> I don't know. I told you, this isn't my apartment.
<s> That's the same guy who did this painting.
<s> I hate this. Turn that off.
<s> About what?
<s> I hadn't thought about it.
<s> You mean babies with you?
<s> How is he?
<s> It's three thousand dollars!
<s> It's vichyssoise, sir.
<s> ...four, five.
<s> The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
<s> Definitely.
<s> Bruce?  What are you doing?
<s> She's clouded your mind.  You're not thinking straight.
<s> You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.
<s> You leave Batman and Robin to me.
<s> I've got to stop him.
<s> Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
<s> But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
<s> Just checking, young sir.
<s> It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.
<s> So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
<s> I'm sorry. Who are you?
<s> I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
<s> I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or I'm going after Harvey on my own.
<s> I loathe bats.
<s> Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
<s> Oh, Bruce...
<s> Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
<s> It's gone.
<s> About Charles...
<s> Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
<s> Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
<s> That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
<s> Uh, huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?
<s> I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
<s> Let's see if she can get my model back.
<s> W... We didn't know how to make one.
<s> We need help.  We deserve help.
<s> Are you a spirit too?
<s> Yeah.
<s> I... I don't know what your name is.
<s> Let me have it.
<s> They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.
<s> Any particular kind?
<s> Of course, her favorite color! How <u>beautiful</u>!
<s> Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.
<s> No sir, I don't believe I do.
<s> That's good. I like to watch, too.
<s> We are not far...  ... our chairs almost touch.
<s> ... The gardener?  ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
<s> I see...
<s> I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
<s> ... I realize this sounds banal but there is no information of any sort on Gardiner. We have no material on him - zilch...
<s> Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
<s> Mr. Gardiner...
<s> Okay.
<s> Malkovich!
<s> Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
<s> Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
<s> I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
<s> Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with.
<s> No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
<s> Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
<s> And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
<s> Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
<s> No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
<s> Hi, uh.  Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. "Ever want to be someone else?" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. "Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding..."
<s> He's a selfish bastard.
<s> I don't know him that well.
<s> Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
<s> Her who?
<s> Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
<s> She ain't crazy. She love those children. She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
<s> My rug.
<s> I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
<s> Separate incidents?
<s> But she hasn't run off, she's been--
<s> Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man!
<s> I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
<s> Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
<s> Okay. That, uh.
<s> What'd he say?  Where's the hand- off?
<s> Huh?
<s> I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
<s> Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
<s> Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
<s> And the fucking money!
<s> What's your point, Dude?
<s> Dude, I'm sorry--
<s> Right, Dude.
<s> You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
<s> Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
<s> Stay away from me!  You bullies! You and these women!  You won't leave a man his fucking balls!
<s> He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
<s> Minutes.
<s> I don't like it.
<s> Then who does he work for?
<s> He was here.  Watching us.
<s> "The Blood Tide".
<s> How can you tell?
<s> You're a week early.
<s> What?
<s> Hey, Mr. Graduate Fucking Thesis here was s'posed to be driving!
<s> That's what Josh and Mike said.
<s> What're you doing with all this shit?
<s> A Cyber Entrepreneurialship.
<s> What're you nuts--
<s> It won't?
<s> Something happened with Marty and Ray--
<s> You want to see him too, right?
<s> Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
<s> Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
<s> Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened?
<s> I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
<s> Look. it can wait till Sunday.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> I can't dance fast.
<s> Let's wait for some slow one.
<s> Okay.
<s> I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
<s> Here's the best part.  We can charge five-hundred a pound.
<s> I just got released five minutes ago.
<s> It is bad.  It's chump change.  We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border.  We're getting screwed.
<s> Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
<s> I don't think so.
<s> What's happening to us?
<s> You mean, like a trip?
<s> I wish there was shit like this back home.
<s> The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
<s> Sail.
<s> How?
<s> Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women.
<s> I assume his girlfriend.
<s> Yes.
<s> We had dinner at a restaurant.
<s> You've tried it?  Isn't it true that you've been in and out of Rehab centers for the last four years?
<s> I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
<s> I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
<s> No treasure maps, huh?
<s> I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.
<s> No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
<s> Wonderful. Uh...
<s> Nobody's asking you to.
<s> I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills.
<s> Just some flies.
<s> All that shinin' and "reader and adviser" mess.  That was your mama's bag.  I don't know about the readin' but you both can sure 'nuff advise.
<s> I have to finish this for class.
<s> I think you're fucking crazy!
<s> What?  They ain't there?
<s> Caesar, you still got the money?
<s> What about that guy this morning?
<s> You think I'm lying?
<s> He hung it up.
<s> I won't.
<s> It's a lot more stressful than I thought.
<s> Get me out of here.  <u>Please</u>.
<s> I don't know.
<s> There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
<s> Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
<s> xxxxxx
<s> xxxxxx
<s> So get the hell out of here.
<s> Enhance it.
<s> All of them?
<s> I won't forget this.
<s> Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
<s> Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
<s> Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful - remember me to Alison - and the - er - twins.
<s> What?
<s> What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
<s> Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
<s> This is your dream girl, is it?
<s> You're not listening, mother.
<s> Thank you for calling Central Services. I am sorry, due -
<s> Hello. Mr Lowry?
<s> Central Services.
<s> Fixed itself.
<s> The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
<s> Sleeping in the back.
<s> They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
<s> Thanks.
<s> What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love.
<s> Crazy fucker.
<s> Okay, whatta I do?
<s> Great.  Network news, Washington... I love it.  What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
<s> I'll put her on.
<s> Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
<s> At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
<s> No, I don't think so.
<s> Thanks a lot, Buddy.
<s> Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  What's wrong?
<s> Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
<s> A picnic?
<s> I can't be.
<s> I didn't have the guts to ask when I first came up.  I'll get you a great tour.
<s> Carla...
<s> Hm...
<s> What are you doing here so early?
<s> Leonard, what are you doing?
<s> A parakeet?
<s> Yeah and what would I say?
<s> It was.
<s> Get away from here.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Besides, Oxnard sucks.
<s> What for?
<s> Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
<s> Yeah, whoops I came.
<s> Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
<s> As for example, what?
<s> I was just scared is all.
<s> Oh, baby!
<s> What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
<s> Oh...  Crash is a very smart man.  Now c'mon, honey, give it a try.
<s> What do you believe in?
<s> Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that?  Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.
<s> Jesus.
<s> Yep.  So how's Annie?
<s> I don't need a crazy woman in my life.
<s> Shut up--I like this song...  April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve...
<s> Can I give you my testimony?
<s> Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg ...probably a bust.
<s> Hello.
<s> I can't! I'm tied!
<s> Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.
<s> That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.
<s> She came to talk to me...
<s> Well...
<s> Call security.
<s> Now look,  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Look, I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to, but it's just - You know, I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. I don't want to do it anymore.  Where's Amy?
<s> Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
<s> If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
<s> Hold it, hold it. Here.
<s> ...to a tee. Like the time Tony Dogs...
<s> Let's get out of here.
<s> Yeah, what'd you tell him?
<s> Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about?
<s> Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
<s> Even the skylight?
<s> He didn't remember to roll up his window...
<s> Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.
<s> Do I hear a woman's voice?
<s> Just like they say; no fucking self control.
<s> No.
<s> Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
<s> I'm sorry.  You've thought this out better than I ever could.  I'm ready now.
<s> Just start walking.  Come on. Walk to me.
<s> Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
<s> I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
<s> Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
<s> I don't want it.
<s> Are you trying to panic the women?
<s> If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
<s> You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
<s> What do you think his name is?
<s> Take your fucking goldfish, too!
<s> Bloody right I do...
<s> What you doing here?
<s> He'd bring me carnations.
<s> I'm going home!
<s> Do I?
<s> That's wise, Tommy.
<s> They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
<s> No.
<s> Ever see hurling?
<s> I told you not to talk that way --
<s> The fastest.
<s> Tell me, Jody
<s> You're going to look for him -- now?
<s> Adam --
<s> Open up.
<s> Reggie -- listen to me --
<s> But --
<s> But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
<s> Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
<s> Why?
<s> I'm scared.
<s> Shut the door!
<s> I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
<s> I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
<s> I'm afraid it is important.
<s> Here's ten.
<s> The kid said --
<s> I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
<s> The man and the woman are married --
<s> But what?
<s> Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
<s> What?
<s> Not my imports.
<s> How much further?
<s> Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
<s> No. I'll handle this.
<s> No?
<s> Are you sure?
<s> But you can't do any of it. So it sucks. I always have to 'set an example'.
<s> Ok.
<s> Attacked how?
<s> The principal?
<s> What?
<s> INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
<s> Hey, hey!  Whoo!  Okay.
<s>  I made it.
<s>  ...shit!
<s> Hey.   Mason.
<s> 
<s> What do you think I'm doin'?!
<s> It's working.
<s> ...frozen!  So if you don't mind--!
<s> Wait.  This town is full of trucks.  Nice new trucks.  You don't need to go...
<s> However, you are also non-en-...
<s> It's too...
<s> INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY
<s> You know the suspect?
<s> ...look like you're after something more dangerous.
<s> Where's Arlo?
<s> ...like April.  It gives him gas. And make sure there's  two pots of coffee...
<s> Pappas, that other guy was unloading ice cream into a freezer.  Now, what could he have to do with a military scientist, huh?
<s> ...that the prey can bite back.
<s> INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
<s> INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
<s> No. She happens to think the last one was murdered.
<s> A private investigator?
<s> I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch.
<s> Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
<s> I have?
<s> It wasn't much of a lie.
<s> I was grateful.
<s> Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
<s> I think I got something.
<s> Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Sure you do.
<s> Yeah, I'll do that.
<s> I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
<s> Yes. No.
<s> Yes.
<s> Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
<s> But you don't have any kids!!!
<s> Toto, come here.
<s> One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
<s> I didn't see that.
<s> Well, then, how could he write that roast?  The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
<s> Yes.
<s> I've tried to tell you, Emily. The President's going to be all right.  He had a comfortable night. There's no danger of any kind.
<s> I know exactly what I'm doing.  Get out!
<s> Hmm!
<s> I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
<s> I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
<s> I'm much obliged, Mr. President, for your concern about me.  However, I happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States, and I say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of -
<s> Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher?
<s> Yes?
<s> I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
<s> Yes.
<s> This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that?
<s> Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
<s> Um... okay.
<s> No. I place the time of death at about three-twenty.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> That's frightening.
<s> Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
<s> How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Shut the fuck up!
<s> What time did we go to the funeral?
<s> ...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
<s> You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank?  You know what the real tragedy is? I'm not even supposed to be here today!
<s> Yeah.
<s> All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
<s> How do you figure?
<s> I don't fucking know. What am I, his biographer?  Olaf, what part of Russia are you from?
<s> Because he's out of shape.
<s> I like the way you think.
<s> How long you gonna be here?
<s> I need my bolt gun and an ice axe.
<s> I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
<s> I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me.  I play it back in my mind everyday.
<s> Are you crazy?  Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
<s> I burned it.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Primed to go off right over his head, officer.
<s> Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?
<s> We always help our friends, don't we?  It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity because of you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next election we shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very unfavourable view of what we tried to do.
<s> Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
<s> Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
<s> Are you now, or ever have been, a homosexual?
<s> Now then. Face the wall. Bend over and touch your toes. Chief Guard inspects Alex's anus with a penlight.
<s> Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
<s> Seventh, files section.  What should I do?
<s> 'Fraid so.
<s> It's simple.  What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
<s> ...Petrov and Cicerno for sure...
<s> Jesus, what is with this guy?
<s> Two minutes to get on Broadway. They're doing some roadwork around the bridge.  Eleven to get downtown.  Four to the Lower East Side.  Six to clear the roadwork.  One minute margin for error.  My math says twenty-four.
<s> Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
<s> I'm cool.
<s> I'm trying...
<s> It was an accident.  I'm not liable.
<s> That what we're doing?  Flowing?
<s> In case <u>who</u> checks?
<s> He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
<s> No.
<s> Just drop me off.
<s> This would be it?
<s> Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
<s> Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>.
<s> We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She --
<s> Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.
<s> Oh?  How's he doing?
<s> You were right, Ellie.  You were right all along.
<s> I don't know.  Maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere, but if there is, I sure as hell can't find it.
<s> On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
<s> Many others.
<s> And mind, yes.  What are you --
<s> You're willing to die for this.
<s> That's good: he earned it.
<s> I don't know, Boss.
<s> Borrowin'.
<s> But damn if he don't look like a fat old Dragline.
<s> Well, how far didya get?
<s> About what?
<s> I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
<s> Good.
<s> ...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern?  Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
<s> We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
<s> No.
<s> Mom and I fought for 20 minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white.
<s> Come on.
<s> I just want to go home.   Can we go home now?
<s> Just think, pretty soon, we'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you.  Of course, if that's what you still want. Ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here.
<s> And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
<s> Green spot.
<s> By color.
<s> Do you?
<s> I've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.
<s> I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
<s> That's Mr. Beast to you.
<s> You don't have to take care of me, you know.
<s> Come on, Letty.   It'll get done.
<s> I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
<s> Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.
<s> Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.
<s> I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
<s> We don't know that for sure.
<s> Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
<s> It's for you.
<s> Don't invite danger into your father's house.
<s> Come and get it if you can.
<s> Not another lecture!  On guard!
<s> You're bleeding, man.  You can't make it.
<s> She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
<s> A whole club of pirates, with pirate names...
<s> "Our" Crow...?
<s> Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
<s> You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
<s> I thought you said we were going to be friends.
<s> Doesn't ring a bell.
<s> I did?
<s> You promised to let me kiss you.
<s> Get out of here.
<s> What's your plan of attack?
<s> Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
<s> Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
<s> I think I should.  3000W?
<s> I'm sorry. I was somewhere else. He returns to the card game.
<s> Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
<s> I live right here.
<s> It was on account of the birthday party.
<s> You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
<s> Yes, Barbara... Barbara...
<s> Got more leaf mold now than we'll ever need, Mr. Reed.  I thought I'd burn 'em up and get the yard clean.
<s> Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
<s> So don't look in his eyes.
<s> Are you kidding? He might as well say, "Can I date rape you?"
<s> Guess she never found true love.
<s> Yes I do have to pee!
<s> I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
<s> I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely...
<s> Packages of money.
<s> Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
<s> Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
<s> Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
<s> You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
<s> Fine.
<s> The guy's in a coma, Bob.
<s> Bob...
<s> I saw the light.  I thought maybe you were up.
<s> I can't.
<s> What about the intro?
<s> ...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
<s> That sounds like a curse to me.
<s> God....damn you, Rhodes!
<s> We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
<s> In the battle, sir.
<s> I don't think they're in school.
<s> I thought I'd be spontaneous.  I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?
<s> I think you're sweet.
<s> All I'm asking you to do is listen.  "The heavens made a girl named Chris, With hair and skin of gold To touch her would be paradise To kiss her glory untold."
<s> Are you going with Chet?
<s> Precisely, Meeks. Greek for the herd. However, be warned that, when you say "the hoi polloi" you are actually saying the the herd.  Indicating that you too are "hoi polloi."
<s> Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Hell no, but that's not the point.  The point is for the first time in my whole goddamned life, I know what I want, and for the first time I'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! Carpe diem, goddamn it!
<s> Yes.
<s> Well, you sure do a good imitation.
<s> Hey! I didn't have to come back.
<s> Not like him.
<s> Joey...
<s> What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
<s> Damn right!
<s> Nick, Vince, Albert and John.
<s> Unfortunately I must now go in, but I leave you my card. Naturellement I pay my players cash American. Just so you know.
<s> How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?
<s> Will you marry me?
<s> Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Place is great. Really. One great place... Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I'll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you'd rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder's neat, I mean --
<s> I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here?
<s> Technothugs?
<s> Put that on your political resume.
<s> Fill it out.  Standard issue mal- practice insurance.  All Cops carry it.
<s> I was part of the escort team that re-animated him.  My partner's dead because of this guy.
<s> It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
<s> ...What are you talking about...?
<s> But what becomes of our souls?
<s> No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
<s> Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
<s> Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done.  Go on reading, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he?
<s> Jabez ...
<s> I wasn't used to being big -- wasn't used to thinking in big ways. Now, I've made up my mind.
<s> Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?
<s> I object.
<s> The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
<s> It's corny, but I could live with it.
<s> They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
<s> Sure.  Follow me.
<s> Heidi, I'm dying.
<s> Yeah.  So how are you?
<s> Oh, no ... Women is all we got.
<s> ... armed robbery ...
<s> Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
<s> You were terrific, too!
<s> You stopped?  Why?
<s> Let's go, Sonny.
<s> They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual.  I want you to stop them saying that.
<s> <i>I'm calling from the Kappa Epsilon Gamma house at California University.</i>
<s> That bitch called me a bitch.
<s> Okay.  Domino Harvey is here.
<s> We're not hanging out.  I'm being escorted back to work.
<s> What was you saying?
<s> Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store.  How much will it cost me?
<s> Fuck!  My money!
<s> Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like that.
<s> Run it then.
<s> You gold-teeth, gold-chain-wearing, fried-chicken-and-biscuit-eatin', monkey, ape, baboon, big thigh, fast-running, three-hundred-sixty- degree-basketball-dunking spade Moulan Yan.
<s> I was going to buy a slice.
<s> Don't start on me today.
<s> We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
<s> Famous? I've never heard of it.
<s> Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
<s> Yeah, he's a pirate.
<s> That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.
<s> Wanna bet?
<s> I know I did.
<s> Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
<s> I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
<s> I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Go in there and get us two slushees.
<s> The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester. Try and get in close over the harvester... you'll find this interesting Sire. -- The Duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester. Paul can SEE...

<s> I told you, the octopus is made of rubber.  This is a piece o' cake.
<s> Toss us out on our ass.
<s> Like <u>what</u>?!
<s> I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here.  Say, who's the lug?
<s> Oh my, this is very interesting.  Say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
<s> Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
<s> Tell me about it.  I'm supposed to do a thriller at Universal, and they want Charlton Heston to play a <u>Mexican</u>!
<s> You gotta be kiddin' me.
<s> Oh, hi.
<s> I am.  How's your father?
<s> Here's to Ed.  For making us into something.
<s> Yes!
<s> Al!!
<s> You asked me if I had a dream. I said "Sure, I have a dream. I just don't know what it is yet."
<s> I'm not sure about the entire concept.
<s> No.  The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny.
<s> Yes to me or yes to the coil?
<s> I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
<s> So maybe this is my dynamite.
<s> No... Could you?
<s> No. What happened?
<s> Dick.
<s> Yeah.  Okay.  well, good luck Tracy
<s> That said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done.  We'll begin with president.
<s> Yes?
<s> You will.
<s> Oh yeah, you bet.
<s> Don't worry about Tracy.  She'll be fine.
<s> Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
<s> You've got it, Wendell.
<s> They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
<s> Susan Lefferts.
<s> Dick Stensland.  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?
<s> I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.
<s> All right, Ed.  Call Sergeant Vincennes.
<s> In my car.  Blackmail shit.  The trunk under the carpet.  Patchett got me to photograph a cop fucking this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks just like Veronicaaa --
<s> White's a mindless thug.
<s> And now you'll provide them.
<s> No.
<s> I want you to follow Bud White.
<s> Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My father ran into him off duty.  He shot my father six times and got away clean.  No one even knew who he was.  I made the name up to give him some personality.
<s> Some reality.
<s> Sid, cut the crap.  I --
<s> Oh my God...
<s> Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?

<s> Yes.  Absolutely.
<s> No, but I think I do.
<s> Listen to me, Katharine.  You've broken your ankle and I'm going to have to try and bind it.  I think your wrist might be broken, too - and some ribs, which is why it's hurting you to breathe.  I'm going to have to walk to El Taj.  Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or another before I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes and his camel.  And then I'll be back and we'll be fine, and I'll never leave you.

<s> It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
<s> What? Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.
<s> Very true!
<s> Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
<s> Go away.
<s> No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.
<s> Good morning.
<s> It is.  Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.
<s> Thank you.
<s> So you had to be your own lifeline.
<s> Get the hell in.
<s> And the money goes--
<s> You've thought of everything.
<s> Like a woman of mystery.
<s> Suspicious, after all these years?
<s> We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...
<s> An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
<s> Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...
<s> I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the one who said I was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me.
<s> Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh?  And <u>you</u> fired <u>me</u>.  Jesus.
<s> So you think we got 'em scared?
<s> Did he say why?
<s> I don't know.  Few days.  Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.
<s> Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.
<s> Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
<s> Strong is Vader.  Clouded is your fate.  Mind what you have learned ... Notice everything, everything!  It can save you.
<s> Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
<s> Barks his agreement.
<s> Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
<s> To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
<s> Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
<s> They look pretty docile.
<s> Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time.  Somebody else was in there with her.
<s> Don't lie to me.
<s> Find Cuervo Jones.
<s> Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
<s> The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
<s> You and the land are one. Drink from the chalice. You will be reborn and the land with you.
<s> Yes. I would swear my love to you.
<s> Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...
<s> No, she was heavily sedated.
<s> Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!
<s> Could you see her?
<s> Yes I did, I'm sorry.
<s> I wouldn't talk.
<s> Do you not like him like daddy?
<s> So what's wrong with her?
<s> Who are you?
<s> No momma.
<s> Very much.
<s> Sometimes.
<s> Oh.
<s> In the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.  Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.
<s> My pleasure.
<s> Fuck him.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I don't know. Some disease.
<s> He's just afraid to show it. Aren't you, little brother?
<s> No. You listen.  I had my doubts about you from the beginning
<s> Job.
<s> You want me to walk you?
<s> Just dinner and dance, right?
<s> Who's Nina?
<s> Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it?
<s> You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
<s> We need to talk.
<s> Something good?
<s> Were you there to catch me?
<s> Shoot him!
<s> What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
<s> That's what I'd like to know.  She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.
<s> Hey Santa, where are you? Everybodys here.
<s> Tell me you recognize me, Arnie.  Please...
<s> Give me my goddamn life back!
<s> Well do whatever it is you do well, and just...just do it. Excuse me...
<s> Look, you dont understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
<s> No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didnt we?
<s> Thats the one...
<s> You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
<s> Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.
<s> I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.
<s> It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
<s> Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
<s> That's what we're here to find out.
<s> <Me>?
<s> Tell him where he fits in, will you? I've got a few things to check out.
<s> Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
<s> Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
<s> Well, if you happen to be very fond of him -- even in love with him -- it would certainly affect your point of view.
<s> Well, it seems to me if you reduce a ship to microscopic size -- and the stream remains constant -- we'd take quite a beating.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
<s> I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
<s> ...What're you talking about?
<s> They're playin' the Buckeyes!
<s> Yah, but think this thing through here, Wade. Ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go? You gotta listen to me on this one, Wade.
<s> Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.
<s> Just a Diet Coke.
<s> Yah, ya know it's the Radisson, so it's pretty good.
<s> No. No. They never married.  Mike's had psychiatric problems.
<s> Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!
<s> Sure.
<s> Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
<s> Don't ask.
<s> My suitcase was vibrating?
<s> Don't watch.  I can't if you watch.
<s> You don't know that.  There could still be people inside.
<s> What?
<s> Very good, Sir.
<s> No, please, no, God, no!
<s> Exact order?  Then I'm next!  I was meant to die with my friends, so I'm next!
<s> Signs?
<s> Of course not.  That would be irresponsible and unprofessional.
<s> I've got to stop and help those people.
<s> Eighteen.  And it's "Hebrew".
<s> I think a nurse named Kalarjian is going to choke Isabella to death!
<s> Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
<s> No! No! Don't!
<s> Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
<s> She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
<s> What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
<s> Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
<s> He can't hear you.  Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub....  I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand...  ..."catatonic  stupor"...condition  rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...
<s> Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
<s> Tonight!  How's tonight?
<s> I know!
<s> Serveza yourself!
<s> I can't talk to you right now, leave me alone...
<s> All right, let's have a rematch.
<s> Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
<s> I hope I didn't hear that.
<s> I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
<s> Victor.
<s> Um. Yeah! Shorty!
<s> No, c'mon, stop playin'. The girl that you kissed when we got there. Where s he live at?
<s> Positive.
<s> Your friend must be misinformed.
<s> One. B-a-b-a-r.
<s> No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
<s> No idea.
<s> That's it?
<s> Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
<s> What?
<s> Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
<s> You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
<s> Precisely. Are you a good shot?
<s> Deal.
<s> Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.
<s> I'd say charcoal.
<s> But I ain't got you...
<s> Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
<s> Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
<s> Su-ure.  Two people hired me to find Zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and Colleen threw a tizz when we took hers.  Obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty.  But it's not necessary.  People are dead.  One was a friend.  The same people were involved in a scam to rip off Grendel Records. Bottom line's Julian Grendel is doing a little revenge number...
<s> Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
<s> Golly, I'd probably faint.
<s> Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
<s> Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
<s> You're a poet and didn't know it.
<s> Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
<s> What?
<s> Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.
<s> Takin' care o' business, honey.
<s> Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
<s> This could be it, Walter.  This Candy Store guy, putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections all over him. Then on our own, after working the whole day and night, we tail him out to Brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically, and who do we come up with?  Joel Weinstock.  You gotta let us have it.
<s> What is that old building?
<s> Switches are shorted out.
<s> Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do.
<s> The usual.
<s> Did he?
<s> Luck, my ass.
<s> I think you know, Frank.
<s> Let's go.  Do us both a favor.
<s> I know.  Sorry, Dad.
<s> Frank...Frank Sullivan.
<s> Wait a sec...there was something on the news.  Something about this space anomaly.  I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69.
<s> Tell me.
<s> I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.
<s> Hey, Ma, it's me.  Checking in.  Probably at work.  Anyways, I'll see you tomorrow night.  Love you.
<s> If you insist.
<s> I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
<s> What?
<s> I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
<s> Why?
<s> No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
<s> Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
<s> He was dead.  He had to be dead...
<s> No.
<s> Don't be ridiculous!
<s> Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
<s> I'm not going near any lifeboat!
<s> What do I exude?
<s> `The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
<s> In and out of bed.
<s> I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?
<s> Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
<s> It's a simple subject.
<s> When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
<s> I know it sounds easy. But something happens between the time I hear the line and the time I'm suppose to Jrepeat it.
<s> I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
<s> In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
<s> That was England.
<s> It's split the Government.
<s> I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
<s> By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
<s> What's wrong with him?
<s> You know I'm scared of heights.
<s> This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him...
<s> Hi.
<s> It's all right.
<s> I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
<s> Oh, Jesus... how?
<s> I'm good at that.
<s> Not now.
<s> I left last year.
<s> Large Scotch.
<s> And that'll make me feel better?
<s> I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.
<s> What?
<s> You're saying "me."
<s> What if you don't get caught?
<s> Yes.  I'm sure.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> I've...look.  Will someone get this guy off my back.
<s> ...then...
<s> Good.  Now we're talking.
<s> That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
<s> What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.
<s> Don't fuck with me, John, don't fuck with me...what are you saying?
<s> No, I think I don't want your money. I think you fucked up my office. And I think you're going away.
<s> She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...
<s> But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.
<s> Some of them...
<s> I'm not hungry.
<s> No.
<s> There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
<s> Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone?  What do you think of my angel?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
<s> It was a boy.
<s> Mike, it would be like trying to kill the President; there's no way we can get to him.
<s> Yeah, it worked.  Those were great old days.  We was like the Roman Empire.  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
<s> Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.
<s> Actually, I've come with good news; the Corleone family has done you a favor.
<s> Not for a few years.
<s> I know.  That's why I want you to be fair with them.
<s> What's to be jealous of?
<s> It never crossed your mind?
<s> Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
<s> And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
<s> Sounds like something you feed the dog.
<s> I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> But we have to match the other sketch.
<s> Catch my death.
<s> The Great War?
<s> You're crazy.
<s> I wanted to be alert for your visit today.  Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital.
<s> You only embarrass yourself.
<s> You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
<s> I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you.
<s> Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.
<s> What rumors might those be?
<s> I don't think so, Detective ...
<s> Your girl works in there ...
<s> Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
<s> It's arright ...
<s> There's no one left ...
<s> You remember that, Kip?
<s> Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
<s> I can handle it --
<s> Okay.
<s> Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
<s> It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
<s> I can't do it anymore.
<s> Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him.
<s> Nothing. I dropped the soap. That's all.
<s> Probation, counselin', few days a week.
<s> Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way.
<s> All right Morgan, fine. I'll tell you why we're not going to "Kelly's." It's because the take-out bitch is a fuckin' idiot. I'm sorry you like her but she's dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once.
<s> Yah, that was different. Management was restructurin'--
<s> Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.
<s> That's one aspect of what we do.
<s> Really?
<s> What're those?
<s> Well, it seems we're in the presence of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau is a Field's Medal winner. Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986.
<s> I got your card.
<s> Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
<s> Sean, I really don't think you understand--
<s> --Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
<s> --Gerry--
<s> --And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him!
<s> I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
<s> Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
<s> Now you know Will, and I know, what you need to be doing. You have a gift.
<s> You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
<s> Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that.
<s> Well I think that's a wonderful philosophy, Sean. That way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone.
<s> What? Do I wonder if I'd be better off if I never met my wife?
<s> Yeah.
<s> You're not going to fail me are you?
<s> It sure ain't good.
<s> Thanks you.  So, that's it? We're done?
<s> See, it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line.
<s> Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
<s> Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
<s> Not tonight.
<s> Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
<s> Just around that next bend.
<s> They never wrote you nothing?
<s> 'S all right, Grampa. You just kind a tar'd, that's all. Somebody fix a pallet.
<s> Sometimes they do.
<s> Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy.
<s> I know that! But *where* they gone?
<s> We gonna stay, ain't we?
<s> Shore looks like my lucky day, anyway. Gettin' some work at las'.
<s> A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
<s> This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
<s> Jesus Christ!
<s> I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
<s> Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette.
<s> No harm no foul.
<s> Yup.
<s> See you in ten years.
<s> Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
<s> College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...
<s> It is. It's lovely.
<s> I didn't know I had to.
<s> Then why do you want to leave?
<s> Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
<s> LEAVE ME ALONE!!
<s> Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
<s> Take your time.
<s> Diane!
<s> I understand...
<s> It's cool!
<s> Alright sir.
<s> Super hero like even.
<s> Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
<s> Think you can do better?
<s> You're not gonna win.
<s> The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
<s> Brady! Come with us.
<s> Coming.
<s> Dad, what's going on?
<s> The state police won't know how to stop him.
<s> Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
<s> Hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  And assuming what you say is true..
<s> Old jerko got caught throwing eggs and soaping windows. His parents grounded him for the weekend. He can't come over tonight.
<s> I can't.
<s> Will you call me tomorrow?
<s> Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
<s> We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
<s> Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?
<s> I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
<s> Well, let's hope so.
<s> Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't such a big hit.
<s> Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
<s> Oh, that's nice.
<s> Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.
<s> No.
<s> Jesus...Jesus!
<s> Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap.
<s> He's the one that's made every ingenue in stock!
<s> Oh, your kids are so adorable.
<s> Here.  Be careful with those.
<s> We didn't hit it off.
<s> I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
<s> You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.
<s> I <u>swear</u> to you...
<s> It's a growth business.
<s> M'I gonna see you tonight?
<s> You said the <u>bad</u> news...
<s> I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
<s> Well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>I</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...
<s> Then, she, <u>herself</u>, possessed some knowledge of the Greater World...How pleased am I to see you looking so well...
<s> Enchante.
<s> ...who say...?
<s> ...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
<s> Let's get her <u>out</u> of here....
<s> What is that that smells so wonderful.
<s> Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some Hindu <u>God</u>...
<s> I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. 
<s> Every suicide kills two.
<s> Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
<s> ...<u>what</u>...?
<s> We are here on sufferance.  I am here...
<s> It is a gravestone in the cemetery of ______ in my native Florence.
<s> Brazilian. 
<s> And what does <u>that</u> mean?
<s> How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?" 
<s> That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it.
<s> That wants to be a Yes.
<s> About ten years a--why...Don't look at these...Come on...Stop.
<s> I should leave. You probably need your rest.
<s> We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
<s> Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
<s> French.
<s> This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! Get the respect in death you'll never get in life.
<s> leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room.
<s> You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
<s> He . . .
<s> Hurry up! I'm freezing!
<s> All right, then.
<s> Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
<s> Where's my wife?
<s> Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
<s> No, thanks I've got a... a date tonight-
<s> You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
<s> An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...
<s> I wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, Mister Winston...
<s> He's pretty... remarkable.
<s> No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
<s> No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here.  And if you want to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.
<s> We'll talk in the morning.
<s> Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
<s> Would you?
<s> Then it's worth the journey.
<s> For what?
<s> That doesn't matter.
<s> I'll be fine.
<s> I don't know anymore.
<s> That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this --
<s> The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
<s> Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
<s> Dennis.
<s> You worry about your end.  I got my side covered.
<s> What are we going to do about Mike?
<s> Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
<s> Can you get into the office?
<s> I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
<s> What did you overhear?
<s> What is it?
<s> Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
<s> It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
<s> Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either.
<s> -- the whole thing is falling apart!
<s> I'm moved beyond words.
<s> -- was that??
<s> -- I pose you the same question --
<s> Or somebody wanting me to believe that.
<s> Well, I can't, sweetheart.
<s> The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
<s> By killing them?
<s> Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
<s> No...  NO!
<s> We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
<s> Before.
<s> Under the Underground?  What's that? Where is ...
<s> No.  We want ...
<s> What did you see?  The same as I. Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You saw the working of the world in miniature.
<s> Ah, had the perfect amount of foam.  Just get me to the bar... It's the one good thing in my life that'll never change....
<s> Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...
<s> Terrific.
<s> Well, I --
<s> Wait a minute!
<s> No, sir.
<s> Sir, my leg is on fire!
<s> Jessica was never any good for Paul.  You will be, you are.  And Mother -- seeing Jessica day after day -- never able to escape, never able to forget.  Please, Betsy -- it's only merciful.
<s> Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
<s> Don't.  It will save you a great deal of trouble and other people a great  unhappiness.
<s> So maybe you'll come too?
<s> Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
<s> Ben.
<s> If I were a fascist I would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago. Now get to bed.
<s> Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
<s> Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
<s> And remember, with your erogenous zones lubricated as such with the mighty herb, do not attempt terrestrial contact with members of the opposite sex -- because you drone on like a motherfucker when you're stoned.
<s> It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really --
<s> Tell Sandy? What?
<s> Why?
<s> After that she left the party to go to him.
<s> You're not missing much.
<s> You're going to be brought in for questioning.
<s> This an accident, Walter?
<s> And suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! And we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.
<s> Yes...
<s> Do you think so?
<s> Anything is possible. But just try it for a week. Come into New Orleans and let me show you some real sport!
<s> Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
<s> He was dead to us. We were free. That was all that mattered.
<s> Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.
<s> Where is everyone? I'll ask --
<s> It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.  It just isn't.
<s> Fine. Show me the body.
<s> It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school.
<s> I'm okay.
<s> We'll call you back with all the details...So what's your favorite radio station?
<s> See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it.  Some folks just can't sail.
<s> They're all dead...Dead, I tell you.  Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss.
<s> Good winds and bad winds!
<s> Very well. I'll wager a dinner.
<s> I think not.
<s> Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids?
<s> Well, who are you, then?
<s> Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
<s> No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
<s> Oh, stop that grunting.
<s> Don't hurt my ear again!
<s> Still after that first million before you're thirty.
<s> What's that?
<s> George . . .
<s> That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen. Have you got any money?
<s> George, darling! Where have you been?
<s> Oh, no you don't. Harry, now, not my best Haviland.
<s> What?
<s> Well, I don't know....
<s> Sean!  Listen!  Listen to me, Sean.
<s> Let's just go sailing, okay?
<s> Yeah?
<s> It's good with coffee.
<s> Affirmative, affirmative.  Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port.  I heard you.  Patrol out.
<s> That's a crock of shit.
<s> Nope.
<s> I'm going.
<s> Len, can I see you a minute?
<s> Get the hose!  We've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
<s> You buying?
<s> Hi, baby.
<s> Hydrophobia...
<s> It's all controlled from the Control Room.
<s> I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
<s> The water ski show!  We have to get them out!
<s> And big for his age.
<s> Don't blame yourself.
<s> That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.
<s> Yeah, poor bastard.
<s> All right, hit those lights too.
<s> Don't hurry back.
<s> Puppy love.  This time it's real! We can have a double wedding.
<s> My mother always told me, if God had intended us to ride parachutes for fun, we'd have been born with free tickets....
<s> I'm hungry, Mom....
<s> You guys must be starving....
<s> I'm just getting started....
<s> Your brother's dead...Your father's dead....
<s> It's Jake's actually...Our floating lab....
<s> Trying to write our report....
<s> I always listen to my feelings....
<s> Boss' day off...Take the wheel....
<s> I made them, man....
<s> Forget it....
<s> As long as he's been here....
<s> Just trying to be helpful....
<s> Yeah?
<s> I think you're here all day.
<s> He didn't shoot it, Ross. And no way by accident. There's a flash-burn. It was point-blank.
<s> Just makes to so God damned mad ..
<s> Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
<s> We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
<s> You ain't going in alone?
<s> We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..
<s> <u>If</u>, your friend from San Diego was up here, and thought for <u>one</u> out of <u>two fucken seconds</u>, she was a danger to him, he'da taken her out weeks ago ..
<s> Which is what?
<s> Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left ..
<s> No, I'm just... anxiously looking past it.  I already had my bachelor party.  It was called "my twenties." See you later.
<s> My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said "you complete me." _ 40.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Happy. He said "happy?"
<s> Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts.  _ 86.
<s> Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours.
<s> Do I know everything there is to know here?  You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?
<s> Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me.
<s> I gotta get back to Cushman.
<s> Rod, get on the camel.
<s> How do I know?
<s> No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there.
<s> Go.  Flee.
<s> Well.  Good luck with that --
<s> Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
<s> The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
<s> You mean it?
<s> We'll be broke in four weeks.
<s> But then you never get to go in space.
<s> No we're not.
<s> No.  I feel something.
<s> Former academic.  Now I actually make things.  I don't just talk.
<s> Everyone, keep your voices down!
<s> It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
<s> Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
<s> Oh, no!
<s> They'll all be fine.  Who better to get the children through Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?
<s> Not just every six weeks.
<s> Stick to my heels.
<s> Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?
<s> In a box under my seat.
<s> Oh, yeah - - great.
<s> Fuck you.
<s> I was there once... that was enough. Besides... I have to go out to Jason's house tomorrow.  They're... digging up some new evidence.
<s> My client... is dead.  But I think he's a free man.
<s> ... My ... social situation?
<s> Well -- other departments are, yes.
<s> We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
<s> Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.
<s> Sun's coming up ...  We've been in the fog for six hours.
<s> Maybe this wasn't just a trick. Maybe you're in danger of real love, real involve --
<s> Sorry. 
<s> Will you let me go then?
<s> How is it back there?
<s> We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body.
<s> Inspector we understand your position; ours is a little different. We have an investment in Tom Grunemann. The Company has an investment, and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves.
<s> The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?
<s> I'm allergic to onions.
<s> Uh, uh...We didn't have television then.
<s> Like a principal?
<s> Oh, God...Oh, my God...
<s> First, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. Especially where custody is involved.  Got it?
<s> Ted?  Are you there?
<s> What d'you know about how Joanna felt?  You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.
<s> Any day.
<s> And you have horses? You love horses.
<s> All?
<s> At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
<s> It is an island. American territory.
<s> So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
<s> Is that a true story, or pretend?
<s> I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.
<s> Nobody <u>lives</u> on this lake.  it's really <u>his</u> lake now.
<s> And you like me.
<s> It came from across the lake.
<s> Good.  See ya soon.
<s> I heard something.
<s> He heeds a tourniquet.
<s> So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
<s> Let's go.
<s> Wait.
<s> Else.
<s> I will... I promise.
<s> They weren't there. Get close-ups.
<s> Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum.
<s> Let's get some coffee and talk.
<s> They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
<s> And you'd hate to think you were common. My, wouldn't that sting! Well you're far from common, Officer Starling. All you have is the fear of it.  Now please excuse me. Good day.
<s> I never thought about it.
<s> There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.
<s> Because what I am interested in is right here...
<s> I have nothing to go back for.
<s> Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!
<s> What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!
<s> We'll see in the morning...
<s> By your leave, sir.
<s> You have heard your answer, Monsieur le Marquis. 
<s> Wampum?
<s> When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart. Before he dies Magua will put his children under the knife so the Grey Hair will see his seed is wiped out forever.
<s> Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
<s> It's Hazy...It's got him! Stay here and don't let him out.  I'm going to get the Doc.
<s> Jameson?  Who're you trying to con?
<s> He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.
<s> Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
<s> All right, Kenny.
<s> Invitations?
<s> Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.
<s> I'll only be a minute.
<s> Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
<s> That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
<s> No, sir--
<s> It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer.
<s> So is Buddy on your short list?
<s> You little pissant--
<s> It's a lead mine.
<s> You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
<s> You could take it--
<s> Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
<s> Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
<s> Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.
<s> I'm surprised he bothered with it.
<s> They've got my Amado.
<s> You sell much out here?
<s> Hell of a spot to put a business.
<s> You heard right.
<s> I'm out of here, man!  Are you coming?
<s> I'm no bodyguard.
<s> Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
<s> Yes...
<s> You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour.
<s> You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
<s> Philosophy.
<s> I don't want to be.
<s> A coke.
<s> Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.
<s> Do you want to- 
<s> Tomorrow.
<s> Hello, can I have room 5601.
<s> And how would you describe him?
<s> Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
<s> Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
<s> I think you gave me the wrong one.
<s> I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.
<s> The good outwitting the bad.  It's like Birdson had a split personality.
<s> Thanks for having me, Sally.
<s> He's looking right at me.
<s> I can't eat before a game.
<s> Nothing.  So good luck.
<s> What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
<s> Thanks, sweetheart.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Yeah, right.
<s> Too many times.
<s> I wouldn't know.
<s> Just not my type, I guess.
<s> I just can.
<s> What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
<s> Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
<s> I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
<s> That what you think?
<s> My court, I go first.
<s> I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
<s> Well, can you give him this for me?
<s> These adults are tough enough, I think you'll be surprised -- the Mexican's a bit of a question mark --
<s> Please.  It doesn't have to be now. Maybe we can make a date to sit down, I didn't mean to walk in on you like this --
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> No, no.
<s> It's ok, boy.
<s> That's confidential information, little man.
<s> -- and I'm through playin' games.
<s> You're a friend of the family I presume?
<s> Stay that way.
<s> Who?
<s> It's ok.
<s> So boring, so useless --
<s> She's retired.
<s> Let's just wait one minute and stay here, okay?
<s> Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
<s> You're her boyfriend?
<s> What are you doing?
<s> I gotta go to the bathroom.
<s> You're late, not me.
<s> I wish to discuss your brother.
<s> Hold your goblet with two fingers.
<s> They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
<s> There are more important things than tits.
<s> Easy to say, but hard to do.  For what I am trying to tell you is that I am the Governor General of Jesuits in France.
<s> I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
<s> Who?
<s> If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
<s> And you never knew why?
<s> He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
<s> Did you start out area six?
<s> It's just...catching up with me, you know?
<s> I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
<s> No...
<s> I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
<s> What's the bottom line?
<s> I am all right.
<s> VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
<s> The activities of nocturnal animals.
<s> I don't want to know.
<s> I have to go back to Birmingham.
<s> Tank you veddy much.
<s> George, I hate sitcoms.
<s> But wasn't it funny?
<s> Twenty!
<s> Do you wanna wrestle?  It's a good way of breaking the ice.  That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together.
<s> Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  Isn't that true???
<s> Yeah.  They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.
<s> Right...
<s> There's a small ledge.  It's a short climb.  You can make it.
<s> Because... I didn't think I would?
<s> How do you know that name?
<s> That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
<s> I'm coming with you.
<s> Yeah.  But he ain't here now.
<s> So I'll send you a postcard from wherever.  If I get there.
<s> Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
<s> No.
<s> Ok, how's everything going?
<s> What do they expect you to say?
<s> A paper on that one too?
<s> For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing.  Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?
<s> Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
<s> Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
<s> Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it for the appetizer.
<s> I thought you were buying my company.
<s> What 'business'?
<s> Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
<s> Here...
<s> Uh -- he's from out of town --
<s> Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
<s> Maybe it's the draft through the door.
<s> Joe knows what you're saying, just being polite --
<s> No.
<s> Of course.
<s> I am not a dream.
<s> I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks.
<s> Nothing.  I'm sorry.
<s> I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!
<s> What?
<s> I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition.
<s> I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.
<s> Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
<s> When?
<s> Maybe.  Maybe with the crazy whites.
<s> Five minutes...
<s> You think I am in so deep I forgot?
<s> Who's the "we"?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  "Low-level producer."  Yeah, right...
<s> Haiti and Puerto Rico.  Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe.
<s> What's it say?
<s> I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money...  He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige!
<s> You sure are a pretty lady.
<s> I just needed some extra money.  I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...
<s> Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm going to-
<s> Third rail is dead.  Get me up.  There must be a manual override in the booth.
<s> Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
<s> Try not to sweat?
<s> Peter...
<s> You the bug lady, right?
<s> Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
<s> I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.
<s> I'm glad you like it.
<s> No, the typing kind.
<s> Mmmm.
<s> And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.
<s> And you're happy about that?
<s> They've got a book for everything.
<s> Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
<s> Twice.
<s> By fire.  That's the best way, really.
<s> Dont <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
<s> Connection denied.
<s> I know, I am so sorry for so many things. I love you, Moira. I love you. I love you.
<s> I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
<s> You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
<s> Yes.
<s> Bus hit him.
<s> Why what?
<s> So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
<s> Just Johnny.
<s> I'm in love with you!
<s> No.
<s> Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
<s> Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
<s> Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
<s> You'll what ... ?
<s> You're not fooling anyone you know.  Isn't there anything you could do?
<s> Didn't mean to?  You put your sword right through his head!
<s> The Prince ... ?
<s> That's pretty good for a ghillie.
<s> So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.
<s> But I'm the only one she trusts.
<s> You watch your tongue.
<s> Aye.
<s> She's busy.
<s> She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.
<s> Who by?
<s> If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
<s> Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
<s> How do you do that?
<s> Laurie's.
<s> Yes it does.  Don't you see?  We have to play by the rules.  That's what it wants.
<s> That's impossible.
<s> I'm going home Cynthia.
<s> I'm going home. I'll call you later.
<s> Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.
<s> You gotta be kidding?
<s> There is no problem.
<s> It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
<s> Right. See ya.
<s> May I have your name please?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Maybe it's not me.
<s> I'm not sure about this.
<s> That's a shame.
<s> And who bailed you out when a hit was put on you, you sorry sack of shit. Who put you up ? Who gave you a job ?
<s> Yeah, but we're talking 43.
<s> I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?
<s> I am thirty two.
<s> Better, sir.
<s> Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard.
<s> oh.
<s> No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.
<s> You're so clever.
<s> This is a totally barbaric custom.
<s> All right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. Bye.
<s> I was commenting on your hair.
<s> Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
<s> I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
<s> Is there enough room?
<s> No, no.
<s> The last date I had was twenty years ago.
<s> Will you tell her I came by?
<s> Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
<s> Chocolate?
<s> What?
<s> Can you watch the road?
<s> What? Because I'm a little understand...
<s> So your honeymoon is exactly where?
<s> What you said.  Make it appear that he's doing you the favor.
<s> This must be... very, very, hard on him.
<s> I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
<s> What, leaving school...
<s> ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH...
<s> This is the dumbest thing I will ever do.  So dumb, in fact, that I can't.  I don't think.
<s> Like family, huh?
<s> You'll have to speak up.
<s> Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
<s> How come?
<s> No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
<s> I have to go. He sighs.
<s> Eight-thirty in the chapel.
<s> Yes, they were.
<s> Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.
<s> The prison board and the doctors who examined them.
<s> By all means.
<s> All right, Mickey.
<s> Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
<s> It's hard to say Capt'n.
<s> Would the network really not run it without the interview?
<s> When do you want the assembly?
<s> What are we talking about?
<s> I can't do that. Five guys.
<s> Where's Wilma?
<s> Like where?
<s> You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
<s> Watch out!
<s> What d'you mean?
<s> She don't look no worse to me.
<s> Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?
<s> Nice and slow. You come in. Get a look around.  Then I get my wife.
<s> The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
<s> Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.
<s> Yeah. That was me.
<s> You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
<s> Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
<s> Leave.
<s> No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
<s> Why?
<s> Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!
<s> Kristen got a quote?
<s> Hey. There.
<s> I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
<s> But I'm not a penguin.
<s> Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
<s> Really?
<s> What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
<s> The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
<s> <i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
<s> Listen to me, Grady, this is serious. Something really weird is happening.  It started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad.
<s> I don't know.  Where are we going?
<s> I thought I'd wait for you.
<s> He's close...
<s> Sure.
<s> I'm running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access.  A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.
<s> This is stupid.
<s> Thanks.  Well...
<s> Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
<s> Hi.
<s> I only found out you were here yesterday.
<s> The movie star?
<s> Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.
<s> Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
<s> No, it was irresponsible!
<s> H-H-Hearts.
<s> We'll go back just as soon as we find those guys! 'Kay?
<s> Through the ass.
<s> Me, too...
<s> No!
<s> Arrested on an assault charge five times...
<s> Prayin', brother. Prayin'.
<s> Hi.
<s> It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
<s> Your great aunt.
<s> Hm.
<s> Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
<s> I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
<s> Just since yesterday.
<s> Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
<s> You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
<s> No...  I can just tell.
<s> You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
<s> What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?
<s> Is Damon Bradley here?
<s> You used to love it when I called you doll.
<s> I'd get over there, Terry. I'll take the little lady home.
<s> Gimme.
<s> This is for you to figure out. You can have it your way or you can have it his way.  But you can't have it both ways.  Am I right, Sonny?
<s> The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
<s> They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
<s> Charley... . Charley... . Wow... .
<s> Why Edie, I
<s> Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but
<s> O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
<s> Gimme.
<s> It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.
<s> When we knock off let's have a bit of a party. We'll drink to God and Ireland, its whiskey and its women, to Joey and Edie  and death to tyrants everywhere... .!
<s> Keep Charley out of this.
<s> I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
<s> I'm so frightened.
<s> I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
<s> Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
<s> Oh.  Uh-huh.
<s> That's the turnpike up there.  Glenn's waiting with the other car.
<s> Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?
<s> Who says anybody's gonna be with us? I say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- <u>alone</u>.
<s> Wait.  You not Adele?
<s> Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
<s> Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
<s> Thirty-two outta what, twenty?
<s> I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
<s> Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
<s> Faye Dunaway.
<s> With Robert Redford, when he was young.
<s> What, as a sales rep?
<s> My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
<s> Meaning time came, I left.
<s> It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
<s> Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.
<s> You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
<s> You not with probation, one of those?
<s> I wasn't gonna apologize, Sir.  I was just gonna say it was worth it to feel like a real pilot again, even if it was only for five seconds.
<s> Upset?  Why should I be upset?
<s> I was grieving too.
<s> Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season. Don't hit the barn.
<s> What's between you and her is between you and her.  But here's what's between you and me.  Everybody has a hero, Danny. And you're mine.
<s> Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late.
<s> Our doctor's gone too.
<s> It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I wrote you, they --
<s> You're pretty charming when you want to be.
<s> Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over.  I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.
<s> Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
<s> How could you possibly know what I've been going through?
<s> I'll just set it right here.
<s> Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
<s> Grounded? Ha! The story of my life. I don't wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles.
<s> It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
<s> Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
<s> Rosalie Testa!
<s> Are you doing some kind of science project?
<s> How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
<s> Wbat're you talking about?
<s> Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out.
<s> You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.
<s> Well... uh... thanks...
<s> I had a little run-in with Zowie.
<s> It sucked.
<s> He did. We buried him.  There's a place out in the woods... if you bury something there, it comes back alive.
<s> All set.
<s> You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule...
<s> Yes. I think it will be a simple solution. They'll put it in a syringe, inject it into your bloodstream. It'll neutralize the virus. It'll revitalize the immune system, and people with AIDS will become healthy again.
<s> I have AIDS.
<s> I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
<s> What have you prayed for?
<s> There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
<s> What happens?
<s> Get real.
<s> <u>What</u>?
<s> Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
<s> Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
<s> We're all on the same hajj now.
<s> To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
<s> Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?
<s> I'll start by following the shoreline.  And my nose.
<s> Read it yourself.
<s> I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
<s> Listen, listen -- I can speak --
<s> ...everybody gotta die sometime Red... Get back to your foxhole.
<s> Fuck you bitch.
<s> They're on their way...  There's a gook village half a klik downriver, Battalion wants us to move in and search it ASAP, something's going on... where's Barnes?
<s> Would you mind?
<s> Whatever you say.
<s> You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
<s> He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
<s> You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
<s> Because you think your in love with me?
<s> I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.
<s> You mentioned information.
<s> Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
<s> Doesn't answer the question.
<s> Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
<s> She didn't have to.  He could have climbed down from here.
<s> Open it and count it.
<s> So the shell ought to have gone over?
<s> Did we ever really think it was suicide?
<s> Take a look at these.
<s> We might be able to dig out a couple of Suez survivors for you.
<s> Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
<s> They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Can't say, Major... been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird... sometimes I think that nose of his is too good... smells things that ain't there.
<s> I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.
<s> Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive.
<s> You mean they don't have hookers.
<s> Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
<s> It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.
<s> Give me twenty minutes.
<s> Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
<s> Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
<s> Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
<s> I do not marry tonight.
<s> No. No. We have already succeeded.
<s> -- there's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.
<s> Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
<s> Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
<s> In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
<s> Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
<s> Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.
<s> Yes.  We would!
<s> Of Siegfried...
<s> Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
<s> Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
<s> This detective was out there and Norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.
<s> I'm not quarreling, only ...
<s> At any time. You will always be welcome.
<s> Well, maybe it was. I don't remember.  You got to do something for me, I can't stand it any longer -- I can't!
<s> Hotcha! Saved, one job!
<s> I said I wouldn't.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.
<s> I think Daddy suspects.
<s> No, it's another thing. I was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway I thought I'd wait till you got here. What did Dave Wilkie have to say?
<s> Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
<s> There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.
<s> Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
<s> Page proof of a book I'm working on.
<s> Oh, yeah?
<s> She has other things to do, Dave.
<s> Be quiet, Rose.
<s> Who's that?  Zimmermann's money-man?
<s> Well, they sure know how to hold a grudge.
<s> Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
<s> I'm back here, aren't I?  So, you don't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.
<s> If we don't catch a break soon, we're gonna be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
<s> Wave that flag, hero.  Keep dreaming those dreams.
<s> A.D. is a C.P.A.
<s> When you bunch it together, it's exponentially more powerful.  Two sticks have the power of four sticks. Four sticks have the power of sixteen, and so on.
<s> It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
<s> Oh, no.
<s> Oh my, my,
<s> Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
<s> They didn't like me.  They never liked me.
<s> Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
<s> I don't think you're a bum.
<s> ...Still don't feel no heat.
<s> I agree.
<s> What's happenin' here?
<s> Not yellow, cautious.  See, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
<s> Stuff it, man!
<s> Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
<s> Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
<s> I dunno -- she fills gaps.
<s> That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
<s> If I'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?
<s> Have you got the will?
<s> I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
<s> And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
<s> Get away from there.
<s> And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
<s> If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
<s> O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
<s> Courage man, the hurt can not be much.
<s> What?
<s> They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
<s> I take it you still want the money...
<s> I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
<s> Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
<s> I didn't expect that he would.
<s> Why don't you go do better, then...
<s> Why?  Are you kidding me?
<s> Who said anything about killing?  Just keep driving straight...
<s> It's NOT too late!
<s> No.  It's not.
<s> No.  Why?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Why would someone do that?
<s> No I don't.  You sure you havent seen her?
<s> I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
<s> What?
<s> Well you're not getting, either.
<s> We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
<s> In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.
<s> You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night.
<s> I'm okay, you go.
<s> I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
<s> She's going home to New York.  I need some ice.
<s> Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
<s> I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You have to trust me.
<s> Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.
<s> Then come for dinner.
<s> No, I'm not.
<s> Six-fifty.
<s> Cindy the manicurist.
<s> Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him.  Keep an eye on him.
<s> And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
<s> Walter, I'd love to --
<s> I know.
<s> You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
<s> Right, right.
<s> Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.
<s> I don't get it.
<s> Whose show was this on?
<s> This is the one I like.
<s> Hi.  He should book now because we can get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travel agents and --
<s> The woman question?
<s> You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.
<s> Later. When I finish the ironing.
<s> It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
<s> Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
<s> I thought maybe you forgot...
<s> I don't want you hanging around there, hear?
<s> Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
<s> Please open the door, Danny.
<s> You always been this stubborn?
<s> Danny, it's not what you think.
<s> Guess it's our turn.
<s> You don't say.
<s> Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.
<s> When? When did you ever see me use?
<s> Pull your pants down.
<s> Just some buddies.
<s> Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
<s> That would be me.
<s> Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.
<s> I don't expect to live that long.
<s> You don't count.
<s> Rolls to his feet.  FIRE another BURST.  KILLS the last of the German riflemen.  Doesn't pause.  RUNS onto the field.
<s> Sure, what do you want to know?
<s> Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
<s> Look at his face, he did the deed.
<s> He'd like to start serving immediately.
<s> I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me.  I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.
<s> Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
<s> Okay, I give up.
<s> I like him a lot.
<s> Yes, I...
<s> Yeah.  What a day.
<s> I had a checklist in mind.  I thought that if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash.  But all the babies were crying, and I thought they knew something I didn't.
<s> I love you.  Please, I love you.
<s> You mean like career?  Uh, I don't know.  I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that.  So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future.  As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  Your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet.  I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter.
<s> Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
<s> I am happy to say that this bag is officially empty.
<s> Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
<s> How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
<s> Let us decide that.
<s> Over here.
<s> C'mon. Let's go.
<s> I'll give you one guess.
<s> Watch your back.
<s> Where you going?
<s> Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
<s> Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
<s> In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
<s> I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.
<s> You know it.
<s> I just wanted to see her, that's all.
<s> Oh it did?
<s> Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
<s> What is it? Where's Casey?
<s> Ricki Lake.
<s> So who are you?
<s> Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out. Takes a man to do something like that.
<s> Where you guys been? We had to start without you.
<s> Tits -- see.
<s> This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.
<s> You'll see.
<s> Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.
<s> Whoa, whoa... what?!
<s> I expected it to be bad, you know.  I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night.  I never gave it a second thought.
<s> How is this legal?
<s> I'm fine.
<s> How can you say that?  Especially after today?
<s> Call for help, and you'll live.  But, you'll be disfigured.  Or, put yourself out of your misery.
<s> You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?
<s> Seven Fingers...ay-eh...Seven...
<s> In that case you won't find her -- and I won't get my thousand dollars.
<s> Oh...
<s> Look!  Scar?...  Do you know where he went? And if he has a girl with him...a <U>white</U> girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo...
<s> Well, if you won't let me smoke grass, then at least I'll go get myself some cigarettes.
<s> Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
<s> My Massacre at Paris is complete.
<s> You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it as the Rose.
<s> She is always Aphrodite.
<s> I don't know, it's a mystery.
<s> How goes it, Will?
<s> Mercutiogood name.
<s> "Not having that which, having, makes them short."
<s> Verona again.
<s> Virginia?!
<s> Lady Viola isyoung in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.
<s> It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come, there is no harm in a drink.
<s> Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
<s> It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...
<s> All right, then, go ahead, telephone. Telephone the police. Try again. No one's going to stand in your way. Go ahead. Tell them there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it.
<s> You call them if you want.
<s> Can we talk about something?
<s> I don't know.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> Take another look at these two.
<s> You're right.
<s> It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.
<s> The perfect couple, I should say.
<s> Let him go. Let him take it all.
<s> Yes, absolutely.
<s> Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
<s> That wasn't a question.
<s> Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
<s> Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
<s> No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week.
<s> And what do you recognize, names or faces?
<s> No, it's a very groovy girl.
<s> I've got heads here, Norman.
<s> Hey, I don't tell.
<s> Yeah?
<s> You did, I know you did.
<s> Mmmm --
<s> -- yes, you --
<s> She's heavy.  See, Norman expects me to get in here, take care of all the customers and then do his show out in Norwalk. I gotta have my own shop, just out of self defense.
<s> She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
<s> I don't know if you don't know --
<s> Honey, what happened?
<s> I do, Jill.
<s> Yes.
<s> How many?
<s> ... this doing hair it's...
<s> What, do you think I planned it?
<s> ... how am I gonna tell you what they have against you? I mean Jesus fucking Christ, they're women, aren't they? Have you ever listened to women talk, man? Have you? Well I do, I do 'til it's fucking coming out of my ears. I'm on my feet all day, every fucking day, listening to women talk and you know what they talk about, don't you? Being fucked up by some guy. That's all that's on their minds. I'm sure you've done something they could get pissed off about, what's that got to do with it? All women are pissed off, man, all of 'em. They fucking hate us! Don't you know that?
<s> No.
<s> I am?
<s> Well, it's George.
<s> I'm exaggerating.
<s> -- no.
<s> Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
<s> Come here for a minute, first.
<s> How does he tell you things?
<s> Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
<s> Pleased to meet you.
<s> Your money's no good here.
<s> Yes, I did.
<s> Absolutely nothing.  How is he?
<s> Why?
<s> Yes?
<s> What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
<s> Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
<s> You're not going to let it go, are you?
<s> LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
<s> You lying sleazeball!  The best years of my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint?
<s> Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
<s> I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on earth, but I loved it.  This place is a Hilton.
<s> Um, I don't really know this one...
<s> I knew that.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> What?
<s> My what?
<s> It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.
<s> Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  Do not attempt discussion.  Am I understood?
<s> I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
<s> Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
<s> 'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!
<s> But it's a nightmare!  Mother Superior is out to get me!  She hates my guts! She keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!
<s> But how do we get there?
<s> Yes?
<s> Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
<s> You will stay at her side?
<s> Listen.
<s> True enough.
<s> His horse.
<s> I... I can't do this.
<s> I didn't see none.
<s> Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.
<s> I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
<s> See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
<s> I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?
<s> Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
<s> Childers.
<s> Hit was right thoughty of her.
<s> I reckon.
<s> I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me.
<s> Okay. I give you my word. Is ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you all right?
<s> I never was no good with history.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> What's that, Sol?
<s> That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
<s> I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I don't see how you can call that a good deed.
<s> I mean, it's a good story.
<s> Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
<s> How the hell did you get into the building?
<s> And you told your nephew about it?
<s> That's how we met. We're members of the International Same Name Club. Believe it or not, there are 846 Paul Benjamins in America. But only two in the New York metropolitan area. That's how Paul and I got to be such good friends. We're the only ones who show up at the meetings.
<s> Nice drawing. Did you do that?
<s> Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.
<s> That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
<s> I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.

<s> That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said.
<s> Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
<s> Carl never lied.
<s> Yes.  And that one, too.
<s> Funny?  In what way?
<s> I'll say.
<s> As far away as possible.
<s> And I'm Daphne.

<s> I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
<s> I don't know.  All of a sudden, I'm thirsty.
<s> How can I?  No matter where I go, there'll always be a Shell station on the corner.  I'll bring this back when it's empty.

<s> Its been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute, need a prostitute.  You did the right thing.

<s> Toi.  They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
<s> Beats me.  Ask your mom.
<s> You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
<s> I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off.  Doing my imitation of you.

<s> You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
<s> Great to be here.

<s> What'd he get you?
<s> I mean, we've been playing big places everywhere, but when we did that sound check at The Orpheum, it suddenly hit me. I'm playing The Orpheum, you know? I mean, the last time I played here was, uh, the prom.

<s> I don't know. I think she's breathing.
<s> And?
<s> No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.
<s> What?
<s> No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
<s> It's stupid.

<s> Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
<s> Wayne Gretzky.
<s> Look, I might be moody.  I might be gassy.  But I am perfectly sane.  Think about it.  In school, they tell us, "Dreams can come true."  Right?
<s> Thanks!  That'd be great.
<s> Maybe we can make a deal.
<s> Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
<s> I just think pictures should say a little something.

<s> I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
<s> Second generation, huh?
<s> Lady.  you've got the wrong man.
<s> Fair enough.
<s> Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
<s> There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
<s> Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
<s> I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
<s> Maybe deMille is shooting.
<s> Thanks.  How did you know I was going to stay, this afternoon?
<s> You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.
<s> She didn't take it from you, did she?
<s> Just like that?
<s> She has hostages.
<s> What an adorable hat.
<s> I'd love to.
<s> Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question...
<s> What are you talking about, fella?
<s> Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
<s> My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
<s> This wasn't in the plan.
<s> I've been on the job.
<s> I know.
<s> Actually, she's silver-haired.
<s> You're not the only one.
<s> My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."
<s> You think he's for real?
<s> Bingo!
<s> Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
<s> He is. Usually.
<s> Right on the first guess.
<s> Yessir. Just what you wanted.
<s> That would complicate things.
<s> I'll...take it straight.
<s> No.  What's this lawyer business?
<s> What's a ditty again?
<s> The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
<s> I object to that form of question. Note that.
<s> That's good.  Judges like adopted Indian boys.  Tell me more about the Ottos.
<s> I...I just need to know what state you're in so I know...how to talk to you...how to act...
<s> Yes.  I looked.  I remember clearly now.  It seemed we were going too fast down the hill.  I was scared.
<s> No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
<s> Oh.  I better get some spackle.
<s> Yeah, right.
<s> Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha been in?
<s> The next time you want information, Falco, don't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man!
<s> I doubt that it matters any more.
<s> Why, has he bothered you before?
<s> Did Sidney tell you about it?
<s> J.J., Steve isn't...
<s> Everyone knows Manny Davis...  ...except MRS. Manny Davis.
<s> A pocket fulla firecrackers - looking for a match!  It's a new wrinkle to tell the truth... I never thought I'd make a killing on some guy's "integrity".
<s> Nothing I didn't think of you before.
<s> Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it.  It's cold out here, Susie.
<s> Begging your pardon, I haven't been down the bowery in years!
<s> NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that, Dyson?
<s> Why?
<s> It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
<s> Drive faster.
<s> Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
<s> It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
<s> I was warned.
<s> What?
<s> That's what I asked.
<s> Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?
<s> I want it to be over for you.
<s> If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
<s> Then how are you supposed to get back?
<s> He's turning blue!
<s> What <u>is</u> your problem?
<s> ... what... ?
<s> They'll be wanting it back.
<s> Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
<s> Yes.
<s> Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
<s> A Mister... Seymour Butts.
<s> Nothing.  Nothing at all.
<s> Nothing else?
<s> Uh... Nell Vance...
<s> Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake.  Ever since I was little.  That was my job.  I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time.  And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit.  I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this.  I'm really happy to be here with you.
<s> It's not real?  Crain?  He's not real?
<s> I don't know what to think anymore.
<s> I'm trying.  Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things.
<s> Because I don't want to ruin things.  Because home is where the heart is.
<s> It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
<s> He's gotta know why.
<s> Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir.
<s> Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
<s> Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
<s> You know I don't live with him.
<s> Ah... it's nothing.
<s> ...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
<s> Terrific. Your husband backs you up. That's terrific.
<s> He a good man?
<s> Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.
<s> Hurry up!
<s> Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
<s> How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
<s> What is it?
<s> That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.
<s> Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
<s> We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
<s> Footsteps!
<s> Well almost.  Depends which house.  It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
<s> What happened?
<s> We <i>have</i> had our close calls in the past.
<s> As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.  I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.
<s> --Truman, what are you doing here?
<s> Do something...
<s> Working with?
<s> -- Mulder! Get in the car!
<s> They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
<s> No.  It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
<s> This is great. This is fitting.
<s> Very weird.
<s> I don't have his number.
<s> Yes.
<s> About the conspiracy?
<s> Lucien Baines?
<s> In German?
<s> Oh, let me see. No, no that's not the cue. It means she has to sit down.
<s> If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
<s> No.
<s> Fellow called Lime.
<s> What do you want?
<s> We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us....
<s> Read <i>Mein Kampf</i>? Hitler had all his best ideas in prison.
<s> No.
<s> Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.
<s> Notice? Like what...?
<s> What are you trying to say?
<s> Very much, I think.  But, there's going to be a problem.
<s> Everything about what?
<s> ... Okay.  I'll try.
<s> No.  I'm just depressed.
<s> Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
<s> It's Esther. Santa's got her.
<s> No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture.
<s> I sleep it off.
<s> Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
<s> No.
<s> To know where that leopard went -  I'm afraid you'd have to be a leopard and think like a leopard. I was a naturalist. That hardly qualifies me as an expert in hunting down lost leopards. I used to teach zoology in a little freshwater college back East. I gave that up.
<s> Were both thinking the same thing, right?
<s> What sort have you got?
<s> Yeah... The Diplomat.
<s> Well, I hope youre not too heartbroken and...
<s> Spitz. We spoke on the telephone.  My husband...  My daughter, Deborah, whose house this is.  My son-in-law, Carlos...  The gentleman is a business partner of his. 
<s> Is my money in there?
<s> Dying without ever reaching the top...
<s> Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
<s> Good. You neednt worry about the Austrian anymore. Hes dead. Ill be in touch.
<s> Tell me...
<s> What about you?
<s> Gave you?  Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...
<s> If there was, I didn't see it...
<s> I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
<s> Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
<s> What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
<s> Whose were they?
<s> I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
<s> No. Three hundred and sixty thousand, so it'll be easy.
<s> Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
<s> Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
<s> 'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
<s> I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
<s> I was listening, Kitten.
<s> You made contact?
<s> It will be very dramatic.
<s> Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
<s> No, no bible readers.
<s> You've missed this bit.
<s> No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.
<s> Salino?  Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this?  It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.
<s> Hackers.
<s> Then you'll do it?
<s> Let him wait.
<s> A couple days; that's all I'm askin'.  I can stay clear that long.
<s> Where's June today?
<s> Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try not to live up to all my expectations.  We were told you know a hustle artist named Johnny Hooker.
<s> No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.
<s> What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
<s> That's the truth.
<s> You're not missing much.  He's cuckoo.
<s> What'd he think it was to you?
<s> I'm asking you.
<s> Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it.  Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him.  They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal.  So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
<s> Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
<s> Rosebreen.
<s> Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
<s> You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case.  Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?
<s> Why yes.
<s> This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
<s> What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
<s> supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
<s> What'll I do if something comes up?
<s> I haven't been a detective for four years.
<s> You talk as if I were Asta.
<s> I don't believe he did it.
<s> Sure I will.
<s> This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
<s> We can't just go off and--
<s> I got that...sir.
<s> What are they doing here?
<s> They can't shoot us in here.
<s> Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him.  He was going to kill you.  He was one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.
<s> What?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
<s> It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
<s> 4732...?
<s> You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
<s> You are a true believer.  Blessings of the state, blessings of the masses.  Thou art a subject of the divine.  Created in the image of man, by the masses, for the masses. Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.  Work hard; increase production; prevent accidents, and be happy.
<s> -Where?
<s> We just got a bomb threat upstairs.
<s> Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
<s> What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
<s> That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...
<s> T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
<s> Insurance?
<s> What?
<s> Constantinople?
<s> <u>All</u> <u>kinds</u>.
<s> Nice suit.
<s> No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
<s> Um-hum ...
<s> Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three weeks, I believe.
<s> Please.  When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you.  Baron, you are a crook.  You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  May I have the salt?
<s> Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
<s> Yes.
<s> Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
<s> In other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward.
<s> Good night.
<s> Yes, Madame Colet?
<s> I know!
<s> Lewis...
<s> Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
<s> I'd rather be his whore than your wife.
<s> We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
<s> Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
<s> She had beautiful hands.
<s> I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>
<s> You can live that down, can't you?
<s> Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
<s> Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
<s> You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?
<s> Sure.
<s> Are you happy?
<s> I'll never love anybody else.
<s> What's he got that I haven't got?
<s> I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
<s> Say when.
<s> Well yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean I Was no angel when we met but People change Doc.  I mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up.
<s> Look, it's too much of a tangle. I already cast my lot.  I can't go Back and I can't sneak, feel back Enough as it is.
<s> Why don't you get rid of him and Get yourself straight dealer?
<s> Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
<s> Virgil, please.  Don't do this to me.
<s> No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law.
<s> Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there.
<s> I can feel your pain.
<s> Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
<s> Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
<s> That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.
<s> I see...
<s> If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?
<s> Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy.
<s> Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.
<s> Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
<s> ...But because I am a just man, I've decided to give Mr. Hussein what he deserves.
<s> Will you still get the money from your father?
<s> He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
<s> Babe Brother.
<s> You should go back and rest.
<s> Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
<s> Oh, I wasn't pointing my finger at you. Hey, you have to think of yourself. A lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep. There are too many bad people out there.
<s> He is in his pigeon cage.
<s> I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
<s> There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.
<s> Yes SIR!
<s> We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents.  I don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back... Or if you're coming back.
<s> What is this, like freebase?
<s> You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
<s> So you pay off our customs officials?
<s> I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
<s> Then I guess I'm going by myself.
<s> Certainly not.
<s> You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it.
<s> The pleasure was mine. Best interview I've ever been to. Thanks.
<s> My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
<s> It wasn't that bad.
<s> Well, Christ, if I'd known you were going to get so humpty about it, I wouldn't have bothered. Are you going to eat that?
<s> Your favourite dish.
<s> No joy yet.
<s> Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
<s> I don't have a clue.
<s> Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
<s> With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
<s> Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
<s> Put it on the screen.
<s> Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.
<s> You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
<s> Starfleet, are you aware of our currant status?
<s> Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
<s> Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
<s> There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
<s> Come here.
<s> Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a little hacking here. Which I've got every reason, as you well know...
<s> Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
<s> Sorry, sir.  Uh... here's what we got.
<s> I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
<s> No.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> What about the husbands?
<s> Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk.
<s> No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.
<s> I don't know.  I have to think...
<s> What do you do?
<s> Very much. Now, where were we?
<s> At the movies?
<s> She's with me.

<s> 1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!
<s> Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
<s> It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?
<s> Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
<s> He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
<s> I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
<s> Yeah, I'll try.
<s> You're welcome, Grace.
<s> Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
<s> Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
<s> Where?
<s> We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.
<s> It's not locked.  I left it open when I took out Jake's body.
<s> This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
<s> You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
<s> How old are you?
<s> A hundred-forty-five really.
<s> What makes you say that?
<s> Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
<s> Eh?
<s> My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
<s> I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
<s> Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
<s> We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
<s> 'Cause I love you.
<s> One way.
<s> What fuckin grocery store, you fucking shithead idiot! You call yourself a police...
<s> Rust?
<s> No?
<s> I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir.
<s> You ain't dead.
<s> You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. 
<s> "Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
<s> Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.
<s> H-hell yeah. I killed the hell out of him... three shots... he was takin' a sh-sh-shit an'... an'...
<s> Eleven.
<s> Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit.
<s> Nothin's bent.
<s> Plenty of times.
<s> He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
<s> I hope I didn't disturb you.
<s> RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
<s> Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered .
<s> Russian, I think. I don't know.
<s> You know damn well what I think.
<s> Keaton was a piece of shit.
<s> Kobayashi.
<s> Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan. You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11 keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And if they kill me, it's
<s> Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention.
<s> ... a Mrs. Doneghy called ... I told you that.
<s> No.
<s> `They lied.'  Indeed!  When did they lie?  And do you know what a lie is?
<s> She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
<s> You're going to settle out of court?
<s> I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
<s> Let me talk to Mickey.
<s> My subscription lapsed three years ago...
<s> The TV didn't work.
<s> Gimme the address.  I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You use their witness.
<s> The 'History'...?
<s> Me, too.
<s> There are things you didn't tell me.
<s> Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
<s> But you haven't lived here long.
<s> Ah, no!
<s> But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
<s> I don't know... Switzerland?
<s> Before?  Where?  Where had you been?
<s> Good-bye.
<s> What a pleasant hobby.
<s> If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
<s> What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
<s> You're pathetic.
<s> I can't do this.
<s> There is no candy!
<s> So where's that leave us?
<s> He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go.  You guys stay here.
<s> Who's up for making some real money?
<s> I can't.
<s> You hate women.
<s> Goosed!
<s> It's vile!
<s> We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
<s> I love you.
<s> Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
<s> Two.
<s> In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
<s> Today I can refuse you nothing.
<s> Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?

<s> When you are, miss.
<s> Right, let's go.  And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them.
<s> From the terrace.
<s> He was a computer program for crissake.
<s> Do me one favor  if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it.
<s> You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
<s> They're going to fry me for it, anyway.
<s> Because this painintheass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not.  And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7.
<s> Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here... or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
<s> Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
<s> Naw, we can't play this one catch-up.  That's how long since you stopped beating the wife.  We have to...
<s> Okay, look, who's takin' the press conference today?
<s> ...that's the general idea.
<s> Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
<s> ...Stanley Moss...

<s> ...for the beans, yes...
<s> Your men! All my life "your men" have been able to count on you? Why is it that you've never been there for me?
<s> ...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
<s> Nah, she asked the wrong question.
<s> Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.
<s> Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.
<s> You really do believe in destiny?
<s> Why?
<s> A party at a waxwork huh?
<s> No, he wouldn't.
<s> I know he does.
<s> Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
<s> You must have been very proud.
<s> She's making this up.
<s> She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
<s> I was down in Adamant...
<s> What is it?
<s> It's Saturday.
<s> You are so brilliant.
<s> Then where is she?
<s> Wind - I love you with that which is endless within me.  Bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice...
<s> Tell me what I am, Rowan.
<s> How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?
<s> As far as touching things, yes. But the vision - that keeps pouring into my head-    It won't go away God - if I could just understand it.
<s> Really...?  Your family there...?
<s> Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
<s> He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!
<s> No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know.
<s> Gotcha.
<s> Michael - I'm sorry...  Just give me -
<s> No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
<s> Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
<s> Were you always this sick?
<s> Chicks are like buses. If you miss one, don't sweat it. There's another coming 'round the corner.
<s> ...not the pit.
<s> Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
<s> Me-ow.
<s> I have absolutely no intention--
<s> You never know around here.
<s> Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.
<s> Rules are rules.
<s> In other words, our scope is too narrow.
<s> We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer.  You want DNA, that can take weeks.
<s> Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
<s> Oh, for Christ's sake.
<s> What brain?
<s> Why can't you come...
<s> Duquette.  Forget him...
<s> And you believe her?
<s> You got something against cigarettes?
<s> That's right.

<s> You?
<s> Shhhhh!
<s> Me neither!
<s> Sorry. It's important.
<s> I thought I was the English.
<s> Move! Or you die right here!
<s> He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
<s> Probably.
<s> I don't think she knows.
<s> You might have killed him!
<s> I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
<s> Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
<s> Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
<s> I'm sure he could give you some courage.
<s> Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
<s> They would?
<s> Don't you start it, too!
<s> Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
<s> Imposserous!

<s> Couldnt make it. Splitting headache.
<s> Like riding a bike.

<s> The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.
<s> Renard.
<s> The worm on the hook again.
<s> Its the only way out...
<s> Please.
<s> Someone will come.
<s> Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
<s> What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
<s> Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
<s> Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
<s> Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.

<s> Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
<s> Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.

<s> Yes, my dear, he is.
<s> What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
<s> You're incorrigible!

<s> Yes!... the laboratory.
<s> I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
<s> No, Fred ereck.
<s> You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.

<s> Well, this explains the music.
<s> I think so.
<s> Yes, sweetie...I heard you.  So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.
