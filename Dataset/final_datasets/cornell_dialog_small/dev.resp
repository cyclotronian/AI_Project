<s> Cameron.
<s> Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
<s> Go to the prom with me
<s> I am busy inside.
<s> Right.
<s> Watch the news?
<s> You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
<s> Hey.  I'm a professional.
<s> We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
<s> No.  Are you proposing?
<s> A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
<s> Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
<s> Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
<s> That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
<s> Do you know how much I missed you?
<s> What you see is what I got, mister.
<s> Why?
<s> It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
<s> Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
<s> I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
<s> I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
<s> Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
<s> It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
<s> Show me.
<s> There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
<s> PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
<s> Oh, Stanzi.
<s> Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
<s> Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
<s> Why not?
<s> What'll we do?
<s> I got three.
<s> What do you think?
<s> I can't believe this.
<s> But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
<s> When?
<s> You're compulsive.
<s> Oh we're not going to the campus.
<s> Indeed.
<s> Here, have a piece of gum.
<s> Saw what?
<s> We might need some mo' money behind this.
<s> And his baggage?
<s> But not the only victim, right?
<s> Fifty minutes.
<s> I can.
<s> I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
<s> Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
<s> You don't have to say anything
<s> Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
<s> Yeah.
<s> She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
<s> I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...
<s> What'chu sayin'?
<s> I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
<s> Yes.  Well... yes.
<s> Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
<s> I don't think we can do that.
<s> And why is that?
<s> Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
<s> When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
<s> The stairs from the street.
<s> I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
<s> Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
<s> Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
<s> I need to do it.
<s> It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
<s> I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
<s> Mind your own business, Peaches.
<s> Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
<s> I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
<s> Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?
<s> Now that that's out of the way... You want the woman, here's how it works.  You pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever, and I make a call to bring her in.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Hawk.
<s> Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
<s> Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
<s> He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
<s> Yes John!
<s> Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
<s> But you're the Gods!
<s> Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
<s> Yes?
<s> I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
<s> You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
<s> I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
<s> See you later.
<s> I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
<s> Really?
<s> I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
<s> Smile, little sister, smile.
<s> These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
<s> Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.
<s> No, no, they're all dead...
<s> Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
<s> Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?
<s> Who's in command out there?
<s> What I want to know is sir:  where is your daddy?
<s> Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
<s> A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy".
<s> What do you propose?
<s> It's totally sickening.  Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...
<s> I won't even dignify that with a response.
<s> I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
<s> Why don't we start with that next week?
<s> How; we don't know where they are?
<s> If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose you.  Then, the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again.
<s> Benjamin?
<s> No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> I never danced before -- in public.
<s> Oh -- what -- what -- 
<s> You mean Baron von Gaigern?
<s> You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
<s> Where?
<s> No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
<s> Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
<s> What makes you think he'll come here again?
<s> I was going to a funny movie, but I changed my mind.  If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father?
<s> We'll miss you so.
<s> I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
<s> Oh.
<s> I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
<s> Out!
<s> Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
<s> I don't want to see the dress.
<s> I AM house-trained.
<s> Oh, so what's the point then?
<s> Yup.
<s> Records are those big round black things, right?
<s> Never take up poker, Detective.
<s> Yes.  Always.
<s> So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
<s> You're insane.
<s> Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
<s> No. My mother.
<s> No kidding?
<s> No -- what?
<s> What's that?
<s> Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance.
<s> Deal the cards.
<s> For who?
<s> You can do that?
<s> Yes, I am.
<s> Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future.  Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.
<s> Alexandretta. Now we know.
<s> No?
<s> Yes.
<s> Take a left and your next right.
<s> It's not your time. I get time off.
<s> Too late.
<s> You're lovely.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Where would you go to sell a chip?
<s> A can opener! A $39.95 can opener. I canceled payment... It was junk.  You ever bounce a check, Lowell? You ever look at another woman's tits? You ever cheat a little on your taxes?  Whose life, if you look at it under a microscope, doesn't have any flaws...?
<s> You can't prove anything.
<s> That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
<s> Whyuhshe's all right, sir.
<s> Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
<s> Any others?
<s> But the lady says
<s> Get out!
<s> I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
<s> Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?
<s> How many trips did you make?
<s> Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
<s> Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
<s> I was gonna tell you...
<s> Don't be funny.
<s> She broke my fucking nose!
<s> What?
<s> I suppose anything's possible.
<s> Getting too hot in here for you?
<s> No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
<s> That's astonishing. Sera, look...
<s> OK, but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. That'll make me look different. Let's get a drink.
<s> That's terrible!
<s> Honeythorn Gump, is it?  I've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears.
<s> And if she thinks me a liar?
<s> He'll not escape me.
<s> Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?
<s> Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
<s> A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
<s> No, I'm...thanks.  I took something.
<s> I'm sorry, he's on medication...
<s> That's a long story...
<s> Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!
<s> For as long as I can remember.
<s> I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
<s> No. Fred hates them.
<s> I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
<s> Are you so certain you are away from it?
<s> I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.
<s> What does he think of your chosen line of work?
<s> So?
<s> To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
<s> They asked who it was.
<s> They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...
<s> Ugh...
<s> Red, and I ain't no punk.
<s> He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
<s> He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
<s> When?
<s> You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
<s> Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
<s> C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
<s> Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
<s> If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
<s> Roper, we're into it...
<s> Your concern is heartwarming.
<s> You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
<s> That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.
<s> Wait--wait. Let's see--watchdog McGann-- he's bound to move right in--get him out of the way first--  Pardon me, friend--I've got some telephoning to do--! 
<s> Yeah, I know. That's okay.
<s> Here--where are you running off to?
<s> He's lost complete faith in me--
<s> Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
<s> Sometimes he whistles.
<s> I haven't.
<s> They are? I forgot all about them.  What do you think they want?
<s> Well, I play the tuba.
<s> I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
<s> No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
<s> Think positive.
<s> We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
<s> No, sir, none at all.
<s> My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
<s> You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
<s> I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
<s> Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
<s> I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
<s> No speech?
<s> Huh?
<s> Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
<s> For God's sake, when does this end?!
<s> Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
<s> I know ...
<s> De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
<s> Huh? Airport or airstrip?
<s> ...I... I know what you are.
<s> What's his real name?
<s> ...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
<s> Would you say she was ambitious?
<s> For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.
<s> Fall out on the lawn in five minutes, in your Poopie suits!
<s> It sure was.
<s> I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
<s> Do me a favor and don't talk.
<s> PANIC ROOM!
<s> They couldn't have thought this up for themselves.
<s> I assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We'll be prepared.
<s> It's alright.  I'm very happy for you.
<s> Do you believe that?
<s> Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.
<s> I want Trix!  Mommy!
<s> What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?
<s> Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
<s> Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
<s> What?
<s> This is Georgia.
<s> I didn't lie.
<s> 337.....I'm sorry....
<s> We're doing Hearst.
<s> Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
<s> Five...? Yes. No. We're done today
<s> You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
<s> Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
<s> Ever get shot at, run over, sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera?
<s> Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
<s> He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
<s> Hi.
<s> J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
<s> That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
<s> He asked.
<s> You're not going out to look for them?
<s> Yeah.
<s> It's the influence of all those family films.  Right, Mom?  Hey, Mom??... 
<s> Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
<s> Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
<s> Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
<s> Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?
<s> I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
<s> Pour us a couple.
<s> Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
<s> Quaffable but far from transcendent.
<s> I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.
<s> Don't worry.
<s> Looks like that's not all they admired.
<s> Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.
<s> Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
<s> Thanks. That's what I call it too.
<s> That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
<s> Yes, I'd like that.
<s> Goodnight, sweetheart.
<s> You're a stuttering Stanley!
<s> Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.
<s> You know how rumors start.
<s> Running blocker.
<s> Mortal.
<s> I want to stop taking those pills.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> I know.  I've got one too.
<s> Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
<s> Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
<s> Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will.
<s> Where. Up Joey's ocarina. Didn't you know?
<s> Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
<s> Here it comes. Now, Spock.
<s> KHAN!
<s> They just don't want us going in there.
<s> Well, that's different.
<s> ... Are you joking?
<s> I'll be here.
<s> I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
<s> Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.
<s> Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help.
<s> Intercept course, full impulse.  Weapons status?
<s> They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
<s> There... were no other ships in the sector.
<s> Who else?
<s> Good enough for one - two would look suspicious... killed while attempting escape... now that's convincing for both.
<s> I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
<s> Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed.
<s> Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?
<s> When can we expect containment?
<s> Space?
<s> What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?
<s> What?
<s> I ask for Justice.
<s> Shhhhh.
<s> Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place? Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-killed a boy?
<s> We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
<s> Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
<s> I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
<s> How does Mother know what I like to do?
<s> Don't let's take any chances.
<s> I'm looking for my friends.
<s> You're the guy killed Dutton.
<s> Yes -- of course.
<s> It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.
<s> And everyone looks like us?
<s> Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
<s> Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
<s> It's only a machine.
<s> [Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.
<s> Sure.
<s> Yes, baby?
<s> Yes.
<s> No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
<s> I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages.
<s> No no, the bigger the better.  But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.
<s> No, Ray. You're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother.
<s> Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
<s> At Sioux Falls Pen?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> I've been trying to tell you.  Someone erased his memory.
<s> Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?
<s> What?
<s> What's Art Esparza?
<s> I would tend to plead the Fifth.
<s> Thanks, Bobby.  And my little round friends, too.
<s> Oh.
<s> You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.
<s> I...
<s> Yeah.  How'd you do.
<s> Like this!
<s> We don't have no paper bags.
<s> Sounds right... I'll check it out.
<s> You certain?
<s> Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...
<s> That's your business... I don't care how.
<s> See! I knew you had it all under control.
<s> Santos... I can't...
<s> You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
<s> Call it a hunch.
<s> In a sense.
<s> I didn't mean it that way.
<s> I... I...
<s> I'm not pretty.
<s> You can't talk to me like --
<s> It's a free country, isn't it?
<s> Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
<s> What?
<s> Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
<s> I'm concerned about her health.
<s> I've made the scene.
<s> What?
<s> Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...
<s> So the next step should be --
<s> Shit.  When?
<s> One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
<s> I'm trying hard to follow you.
<s> That's beside the point.
<s> Why didn't we get that?
<s> Then what the hell are you talking about?
<s> Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
<s> Once, in church, dude.
<s> No shit.
<s> That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!
<s> Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.
<s> How well did, er, do you know him?
<s> Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
<s> What, you think everyone's as ignorant as you?
<s> I shant!
<s> Okay.
<s> Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing...  ...yeah... yeah.
<s> Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.
<s> Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
<s> And... uh-
<s> Nice to meet you.
<s> Or shitty!!  Otis!!
<s> He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
<s> Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
<s> Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
<s> Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
<s> Are you going to deny it?
<s> I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
<s> Yeah -- you can really get hung up on them like the cat in the Delta.
<s> Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy mag, man -- I mean like he was there when it arrived -- He just knew.
<s> No. Walked.
<s> No. My thinking is clear.  But my soul has gone mad.
<s> You can't have water after morphine.
<s> How's the pain?
<s> His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
<s> He can't kill us.  We're on his side.
<s> Which one's the Colonel's?
<s> 26   CONTINUED:  
<s> You left a footprint at the Sportsmen's camp.  Only pretty sight there, Ben, 'cause the two men you didn't shoot and mutilate died of exposure.
<s> Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
<s> Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
<s> What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
<s> What are you on about?
<s> Believe in Penny Priddy?
<s> Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 
<s> I don't like beer.
<s> I'm clean. Smell me. I always smell good. I don't know why, I just do!
<s> Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
<s> So not everyone can be a poet. Still, I respect the sentiment.
<s> Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
<s> Yeah.  Peanuts.  Which is how he goes through women.
<s> Did you really ask?
<s> Hey.  Let's junk the medals, Elmer.  This is not a Veterans' reunion. We wanna make the Governor feel at home.  Not remind him of piles of dead people wearing uniforms.
<s> What's your problem Beavis?
<s> We tried.
<s> I... I don't know what your name is.
<s> Listen, you guys.  These ghosts are really nice people.  I think we scared them off.  Let's just leave them alone.  Okay?
<s> Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.
<s> Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
<s> Yes, Eve. I know that.
<s> We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
<s> Yes. You look very sick.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes. I'm waiting for my lunch.
<s> Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
<s> Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley.
<s> Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
<s> Oh? What?
<s> Yeah.
<s> I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
<s> That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
<s> I'm saying they came into my yard.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
<s> Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out!  I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him!  The uzi!
<s> Wait.
<s> I guess so. you want to help me watch Frank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow. with a camera.
<s> For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
<s> What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on?
<s> A toast!  To Mister George Jung.  Mr. I 95, north and south.  My brother-in-law. Happy birthday!
<s> No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
<s> No.
<s> Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
<s> Who speaks Spanish?
<s> Let's try ...
<s> So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
<s> Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women.
<s> I had a bad heart.
<s> Because he called me.
<s> Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.
<s> Saw Bones ol' Bones on top of the hill. Rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills.
<s> Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
<s> I'm sure I can make your mother like me. But then do I gotta worry 'bout your father?
<s> Like you always said, Pop, look for the undervalued.
<s> That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
<s> Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
<s> I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
<s> I didn't know this would happen.
<s> Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
<s> Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
<s> Bastard!!!
<s> What parcel?
<s> You're joking.
<s> Strawberry ain't shit. Drug pussy.  Me.  I swing like Reggie. Mr. October. Number three, game six, World Series.
<s> No prisoners. Don't worry, Frank, just a little psychological first aid.
<s> It's not loaded.
<s> You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
<s> Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
<s> I think you've forgotten something.
<s> I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already.  A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What?
<s> Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
<s> I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
<s> You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
<s> Do I hear a woman's voice?
<s> I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
<s> Some loyalty.
<s> Where is this canyon house where you're supposed to hook up?
<s> Fuck off, Dave.
<s> Like treacle.
<s> Oh, I see.
<s> Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
<s> You mean, you're a thief?
<s> Up there! I would put it up there!
<s> You're the one who's hand is shaking.
<s> 
<s> ...to be off the island tonight.
<s> Doc!
<s> I've got her.
<s> We don't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy. I know you'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us.
<s> Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
<s> Well... I think I... I would've remembered.
<s> No, that won't help.  Besides, you never get drunk.  I wanted to talk about you and Emily.
<s> If you'd just let me talk to you for a little while, Miss Alexander. All I want to ask you...
<s> He smoked until the day he died. Used to put the cigarette in this thing and smoke it that way.
<s> Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
<s> Awww. That was so cute.
<s> What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child?
<s> I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
<s> Yeah, right.
<s> I'm happy.
<s> Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
<s> Um. Thirty-seven.
<s> Twenty bucks.
<s> You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.
<s> Murder, sir.
<s> You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
<s> Well, when I was all like ashamed up and half awake and unconscious like, I kept having this dream like all these doctors were playing around with me gulliver. You know... like the inside of me brain. I seemed to have this dream over and over again. D'you think it means anything?
<s> It's not that kind of a test. But you seem well on the way to a complete recovery.
<s> No, not just that.
<s> You don't understand --
<s> 'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
<s> That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
<s> The systems integration site.
<s> Long enough to see redhots come and redhots go.
<s> That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.
<s> But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
<s> You know I can't do that.
<s> He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious...
<s> Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
<s> How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
<s> I'm calling in sick.
<s> How about if I call you?
<s> So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
<s> My comb!
<s> Fun -- look at that guy...
<s> She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
<s> What?
<s> Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
<s> I want to go home.
<s> I don't want to kiss you here. I want to kiss you there.
<s> Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
<s> But it was alive  it was fast and strong!
<s> That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
<s> Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.
<s> I really gotta pee.
<s> You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!
<s> Same old thing. Hey, same like always. Nothing's changed. Albert is getting fat.
<s> Fuck you - fuck you.
<s> I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.
<s> And you should be with your family.
<s> Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us.
<s> He's my son and I like him the way he is. Why do you always have to pick on him? If it's not the boy it's me. You don't like the way I live -- you don't like my friends, or my new house -- or anything.
<s> Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts.
<s> What are you doin' in there?
<s> <i>Choco grew up on the streets of El Salvador. When he was four years old... he stabbed another kid in the eye-ball with a pencil.</i>  <i>There were wires crossed somewhere in his soul.</i>
<s> What?
<s> Ask Sal.
<s> No. What happened?
<s> How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
<s> The most lethal poison in the Universe.
<s> Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.
<s> I'm moving out.
<s> Oh.
<s> Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo.  But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop?
<s> <u>Here</u>?!
<s> C'mon.
<s> It's not?
<s> Bobby--
<s> I do not.
<s> I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
<s> I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes.  What about your own book?
<s> He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
<s> I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
<s> And that is why I must go.
<s> They suggested oranges.
<s> We know that.
<s> Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
<s> I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
<s> Because you and the land are one.
<s> The Lord be with you.
<s> Yes.
<s> Go fuck yourself.
<s> That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
<s> Well why didn't you say so?  You want me to lift some weights or something?
<s> Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he <u>likes</u> having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally the perfect woman for him...because you're his <u>science project</u>.
<s> Oh yes, I've heard of you, Doctor.
<s> Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
<s> What's goin' on there?
<s> Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!
<s> Oh, yeah.
<s> Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
<s> You still believe in God?
<s> Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad. It's filth. Filth is bad. That's what starts maggots and riots...
<s> God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you.
<s> I'd have been long gone.
<s> Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
<s> Right away!
<s> Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.
<s> Did you stay here last night?
<s> Yes.
<s> I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
<s> Crystal Lake...where the nightmare began.
<s> Did you hear me?!
<s> It's going.
<s> Her name's Stephanie.
<s> Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
<s> My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
<s> Too late for that.  We're closer to the other side.
<s> They are not babies, Maria, merely "human possibilities".
<s> You sent me to him.
<s> I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
<s> What?
<s> You stay in the car. I'll come and listen.  What you want to tell me, Thorpey?
<s> How many?
<s> Don't ask me.
<s> A bereavement. A death in the family.
<s> Is that what I said?
<s> No, who?
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Tuesday.
<s> That's a lucky C note for our new deal.
<s> I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
<s> And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.
<s> Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ...
<s> It's all microchips and shit ...
<s> Thanks for playing, Freb. That's a gimme ...
<s> Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go --
<s> That again.
<s> I can't do it anymore.
<s> --or a tail--
<s> Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
<s> Come one Will. I just want to know.
<s> Don't hold me so tight.
<s> Two.
<s> We know. But ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.
<s> Women is always tar'd.
<s> Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
<s> Get some sugar too, for the coffee.
<s> I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
<s> Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
<s> Car trouble?
<s> I have a place for that.
<s> ...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
<s> Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
<s> Oh, yeah. 
<s> Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
<s> What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
<s> Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study. 
<s> S'okay....
<s> That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.
<s> Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
<s> About what?
<s> We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
<s> What?
<s> Sir, no one wants to work. They say the boss has left.
<s> No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ...
<s> It's my day off.
<s> They say you never forget.
<s> Who said so?
<s> Too bad...
<s> I came to make peace with you, even if you're the father of lies. I want things to be as they were.
<s> You're not lying to me, are you?
<s> Karla! You promised.
<s> You know me to well.
<s> What about tennis?  Riding? fixing up old cars?  Bartending?
<s> No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
<s> Someone's looking for you.
<s> I'm hungry, Mom....
<s> I don't want to talk about that.
<s> The females have eggs....
<s> I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?
<s> I can't identify him ..
<s> Plus, you could use that commission.
<s> Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego.
<s> Funded by whom?
<s> You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
<s> Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
<s> Yeah.
<s> It's in the report.
<s> No!
<s> Roughly five thousand men.
<s> Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
<s> You talk to Bickerman?
<s> <u>That</u> <u>is</u> <u>it</u>!!
<s> Kelly--
<s> Like I have a "knack" for Dr. Lecter?
<s> Sir!!!  Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!
<s> Yes sir!
<s> So?
<s> He a Black man or an Indian?
<s> Made some money, came back here--
<s> Have we had trouble there before?
<s> The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
<s> No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--
<s> I thought he busted you a couple times.
<s> They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
<s> Nothing.
<s> That's so cool.
<s> Why would I want to?
<s> Thank you, Mr. Harris.
<s> Frustrating.  Form over content. Everything's so retro.
<s> This time get your feet set.
<s> He ain't Spalding.
<s> I don't have a boyfriend.
<s> Let's make a deal.
<s> Oh my god, Jim. Jim, that was so --
<s> Doc, just - don't, how close are you?
<s> Oh yeah.
<s> I didn't hear anything.
<s> Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards?
<s> Earl asked me, Linda, please, Linda, I'm sorry -- Earl asked me --
<s> That is good.
<s> I know.  God go with you.
<s> I cannot, Athos.  Dearly as I love you, I cannot.
<s> And what did he do to the girl?
<s> Yes.
<s> Why do you think I called?
<s> ...after a while.
<s> Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
<s> He's beginning to believe.
<s> That I would find the One.
<s> He is the One.  He is the One!
<s> Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
<s> And say what?
<s> Sure.
<s> 'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
<s> I don't!
<s> Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
<s> Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers.
<s> The honey trap.  And there's the honey.
<s> Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem?
<s> Yeah, well, so?
<s> Roger that.
<s> Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me.
<s> Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
<s> I don't know. I got a feeling.
<s> Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
<s> Everything is A-okay, but I've gotta get that sandwich!
<s> Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
<s> Yes sir, I do. Last night's, fresh from the Park.
<s> Sir ?
<s> Why ? The crocks are all going for the dead crock. There's no fun in it. Besides we've got plenty more for them. The night is young....
<s> I want juice!
<s> Ten bucks.
<s> I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
<s> She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay?
<s> No, I'm hiding out.
<s> Well, I'm close to her.  I wanted to meet the one that got away.
<s> I can't even say it.
<s> I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
<s> Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
<s> Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
<s> How you doin'?  Hi there!
<s> Didn't get much sleep.
<s> Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
<s> Undressed like this, yes.
<s> Right!
<s> No, it was more than that.  It was very generous of you.  It was very kind.
<s> All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
<s> I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
<s> You want to know something I would have taken Wilson
<s> Really.  Hm.
<s> Love is funny.
<s> I saw Karen Sisco.
<s> How are you, Raymond?
<s> For a time.
<s> Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
<s> I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
<s> Which one?
<s> Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
<s> Who gives a shit!
<s> I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
<s> This must have cost a fortune.
<s> That, and the fun of it.
<s> The money that makes you Mr. Clark Brandon.  Let's you live in a penthouse, on top of the Vancouver Royal.  Lets you own a cruiser. Lets you do as you please, go where you please.  You big, open-handed, generous guy.  That's the kind of money it takes, isn't it?
<s> For five hundred, what do I get?
<s> Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--
<s> Guy's the Toxic Avenger.
<s> Shrimp and fries.
<s> Warm them up.
<s> Thank you, Sergeant.
<s> I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
<s> Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
<s> Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
<s> Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.
<s> With you.
<s> Maybe we can handle it together. 
<s> Why not?
<s> The bathroom.
<s> At this hour?
<s> It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.
<s> Sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.
<s> Excuse me???
<s> Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
<s> What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer?
<s> Yeah.  Happy Fourth of July.
<s> I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual.
<s> Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
<s> Hey --
<s> Why didn't you tell me?
<s> You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
<s> It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is.
<s> I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
<s> Hell, I don't know.  If I had some input I'd offer it up.
<s> Not much to tell.  Nothing really happened.
<s> There was more than that.
<s> So someone did get away.
<s> I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> A Chinese man discovered electricity.
<s> Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
<s> Baby Duck?
<s> Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
<s> Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you.
<s> Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks.
<s> Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
<s> His hair... any color.
<s> Or the sexual habits of locusts?
<s> "I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" --
<s> Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
<s> Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.
<s> Do the bosses wait? No sanitation. So my kids get sick. Does the company doctor wait? Twenty bucks. So we miss one payment on the radio I bought for my wife. Does the company store wait? "Pay -- or we take it away." Why they in such a hurry, the bosses' store? They're trying to scare us, that's why -- to make us afraid to move. To hang on to what we got -- and like it! Well, I don't like it I'm not scared ... and I'm fed up -- to here!
<s> Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
<s> They don't send planes to put out machine guns.  Two flank runners with surpressing fire.  I'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast.
<s> Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits.
<s> Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims.  I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.
<s> What?  I'm sorry, talk.
<s> What am I supposed to think?
<s> Hi.
<s> Work that jab, work that hook, work that jab, okay, take a break, take a break.
<s> You must chill!  You must chill!  I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
<s> No?
<s> Until now.
<s> I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...
<s> Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
<s> Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
<s> So, you gotta boyfriend?
<s> Before she dumped him for Steve.
<s> He's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right?  Can you even conceive of what's going to happen next?  I mean, can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?
<s> They have done...nothing...They are my people...
<s> That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche...Chief Scar's bunch...
<s> Think it might be...?
<s> Tenth floor.
<s> A lowly player.
<s> Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
<s> That's what I thought he said.
<s> -- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
<s> George is going to open a shop.
<s> Are you having a bad dream?
<s> Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the office.  Mary Clarence, carry on.
<s> Willy -- hit the lights.
<s> ... Brom Bones...
<s> Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
<s> Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with?
<s> Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
<s> He's a-carryin' me to look fer work in Millsburg where I was borned.
<s> So, you're really going to stay here?
<s> Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
<s> Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
<s> You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
<s> Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever.  No one knows.
<s> You invest in shows?
<s> Not very likely.
<s> You're society girls?
<s> I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
<s> You see, we have those oil interests in Venezuela - and I just got a cable from Dad - the board of directors decided on a merger.
<s> He was pretty drunk, but I think hes still crazy about you.
<s> What?!
<s> Uh huh...
<s> And I thought my mother was the master of guilt.  Geez Louise.
<s> I'm not here to bowl.
<s> So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels.
<s> What if we go out there, you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open.
<s> What?
<s> Antihistamine.  For bites.
<s> What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
<s> How do I know if this is love ?
<s> Teenagers !
<s> By the Creator.
<s> You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
<s> On the coast?  Of <u>course</u> he's on the coast, where's he gonna be, the <u>Hague</u>...
<s> I'm ready!
<s> I can't tell.
<s> Oh, yeh.
<s> Then have a donut --
<s> Rache can do that part.
<s> Just not to me.
<s> Great to be here.
<s> ...gger.
<s> What did you say?
<s> What kind of trouble?
<s> I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
<s> Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
<s> Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
<s> Mm.
<s> It's pretty exciting.
<s> So long.
<s> It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
<s> Miss what?
<s> Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
<s> Tell me.
<s> Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
<s> How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
<s> Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick.
<s> Now This I want to hear.
<s> Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it.
<s> Put down Lex Luthor?
<s> Oh . . . Right. . . I'll be back in a flash.
<s> And she really liked you.  She would've given you all this if she'd outgrown it, or...
<s> Do they have any reputation for drugs?
<s> See my mother?
<s> Of course.  I'm a terminator.
<s> No!
<s> Right. Claims assessor.
<s> I hate the beige one.
<s> You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
<s> I don't think he's breathing.
<s> Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
<s> Like a stroke?
<s> Yes.
<s> Watts.  Those were his keys Nell found.  His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to.  I think he's here.
<s> It's all I could afford.
<s> Maybe he never came in.  If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right?  Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell.  Maybe he's outside.
<s> We all did.
<s> He give me your address.
<s> You don't have to tell me anything.
<s> Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
<s> Yes.  John made quite a study of the whole museum.  He had a copy of my original plans.
<s> Someone's been murdered.  Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn limb from limb.  There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.
<s> An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
<s> --Truman, what are you doing here?
<s> How do you know?
<s> They never found Dad's body--maybe somehow--
<s> Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am.
<s> Of course, of course, of course.
<s> ... So am I.
<s> ...You-you spoke to him?
<s> What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
<s> Do what, Mr Lombard?
<s> But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.
<s> We need another ten minutes...
<s> I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
<s> Yes, my lord.
<s> No, no bible readers.
<s> Te, kawnarna paraikete mo te tahi hawlie 0 te whenna uci.  UNSUBTITLED
<s> I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
<s> I think we're on the right track.
<s> You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case.  Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?
<s> My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things.  And I'm looking after them.

<s> Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
<s> I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
<s> You wanted to know what happened after the line-up, I'm telling you.
<s> Nothing further, your Honor.
<s> I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
<s> Maybe what?
<s> I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.

<s> Eventually you'll let go.
<s> I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board.
<s> Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...

<s> What a great son you are, Ranon.  I wish I could take you with me.  Now go to sleep...
<s> Say again?
<s> Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --

<s> I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
<s> Alright, so I'll get more.
<s> I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
<s> I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator.  The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.
