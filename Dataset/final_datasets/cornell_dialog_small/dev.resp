<s> No.
<s> I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
<s> I thought you hated those people.
<s> Funny, you're the only one
<s> He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
<s> Pirate -- no question.
<s> What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
<s> This isn't homicide school.
<s> He's my collar!
<s> ...Leeloo.
<s> This is a police control action..
<s> Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
<s> You gotta push the little yellow button...
<s> Where are the women?
<s> Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
<s> Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Dead.
<s> Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
<s> There's nothing wrong with me!
<s> No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
<s> Don't count on me, George.  I never had any ideals.
<s> We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
<s> Alive?
<s> Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'
<s> Consigned to flames of woe.
<s> A doper werewolf.
<s> Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
<s> You ask them.
<s> Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
<s> I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
<s> All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk...
<s> What?
<s> Oh, that's the best part.
<s> Yes, naturally.
<s> I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
<s> No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
<s> You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.
<s> Were the flags for Teddy?
<s> You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested.
<s> Milt?
<s> Got me.
<s> What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.
<s> But he killed these guys.
<s> My world famous, famous world Arroz con pollo will be ready very soon.
<s> And what?
<s> It is my only object.
<s> I'm not telling you what happened.
<s> I didn't kill him --
<s> Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
<s> Good, just making sure.
<s> Isn't this how your story goes?
<s> Was she nekkid?
<s> I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
<s> I don't fuckin' cook.
<s> I'd feel better if we had some heat.
<s> Yeah...
<s> Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
<s> No.  I got a problem.
<s> Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?
<s> You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
<s> It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
<s> How do you do, ma'am.
<s> Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
<s> I sure don't hate you.
<s> It's okay. It's okay.
<s> I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
<s> We know there's another stocker.
<s> Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
<s> You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
<s> Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
<s> Aye. But it won't let me dream.
<s> Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
<s> Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
<s> Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
<s> No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
<s> Yeah? Have a brandy?
<s> Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
<s> Not if you work for FedEx.
<s> Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
<s> We're on.
<s> He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
<s> *Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself to death.
<s> She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
<s> On me. For the seat. Cheers.
<s> Jake, I mean, come on --
<s> I think two million.
<s> How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
<s> Justine was not an unwilling participant.
<s> And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.
<s> We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
<s> I was on call. 
<s> No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
<s> I guess she just lost faith in the world.
<s> Why should we care?
<s> Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
<s> Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
<s> Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
<s> Yes, very soon.
<s> Who?
<s> No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
<s> I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
<s> They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
<s> That's fine, Stan.
<s> It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
<s> Yes, sir!
<s> We don't have time to fart.
<s> Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point A" here...  ...to "point B," here.  Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?
<s> Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
<s> You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
<s> Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?
<s> Why what?
<s> Me?
<s> I know you believe that.
<s> Mama, what's...
<s> Don't I know you?
<s> Open this door for no-one!
<s> Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
<s> They broke when you fell.
<s> You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
<s> This is great!  They're going to start eating each other out there.
<s> I think I will disappoint you.
<s> Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up.
<s> I bet you did.
<s> What is it now?
<s> Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck.
<s> Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
<s> I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
<s> Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
<s> Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
<s> I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
<s> I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
<s> Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father.  Except that he can't heave out his ghost.
<s> No.
<s> All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
<s> Sure.
<s> Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
<s> Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
<s> No, Doctor.
<s> Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
<s> Moreover...
<s> Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
<s> I'm cancelling the engagement.
<s> Perk.
<s> The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
<s> He's gone.
<s> My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
<s> Marry me instead.
<s> Okay.
<s> Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
<s> Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
<s> Kirsty?
<s> Who are you?
<s> Your father told me you were working here.
<s> We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
<s> But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
<s> No, you can't.
<s> Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
<s> I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
<s> That is not me.
<s> You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that.  All right, boys. Take it.
<s> Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
<s> Say, could I meet him?
<s> What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!
<s> Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --
<s> I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
<s> Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
<s> Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!
<s> Yeah. I was never so tired in my life.
<s> Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
<s> ...and four and five...
<s> Kiss me Hardy.
<s> Holy crap, thanks!
<s> Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer.
<s> Okay, my sweet. Good night.
<s> And I think I'm going to.
<s> Fifteen.
<s> I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men.
<s> Mm hmm.
<s> Eggs. How do you like them?
<s> Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
<s> Great.
<s> Peace? No peace.
<s> Don't call me that, please.
<s> I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
<s> Hmmm... What did we talk about?
<s> Go!
<s> If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
<s> Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
<s> There's not much to tell.
<s> Why'd you invite me here?
<s> ...they "volunteered." A friend owns a large security company.
<s> And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
<s> I know you do.
<s> He wants a reconciliation.
<s> Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
<s> Do you want to sleep on it?
<s> Oh, no.
<s> Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that.  Send a wireless at once, "Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roadsall transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!"
<s> Sorry, Miss. It's gone.  Ellie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the VIEW then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie.
<s> Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
<s> What's he doing?
<s> One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand.
<s> I thought you said she didn't say much.
<s> You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
<s> I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
<s> I am an expert!
<s> I think so, why?
<s> No! He's coming with us!
<s> That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper.
<s> Chum?
<s> No?
<s> I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
<s> ...Yeah, sure.
<s> Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
<s> Na.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
<s> Never mind my ears! Go away!
<s> In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
<s> Where the spiral begins.
<s> A match for your son, I think.
<s> She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you?
<s> What?
<s> No, she can't move for an hour.
<s> Well, that's what we're trying to prove didn't happen. Do you have any reason to believe it did?
<s> Grotesque... monstrous...
<s> It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty.
<s> Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
<s> Everywhere!  Ow!
<s> A friend of yours is here.
<s> Better make it a week.
<s> What'd you say?
<s> That's a long story...
<s> I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
<s> The Dark Prince is here.
<s> Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
<s> It's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
<s> Uh-huh.  Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
<s> Shall we have another?
<s> Hang on, Lamar --
<s> You say some of the children died?
<s> And where do we bring it?
<s> Soiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile, forbidding -- as a black day. Foully or outrageously wicked, as black cruelty. Indicating disgrace, dishonor or culpability.
<s> Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening?
<s> Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em.
<s> I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital.
<s> [Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us.]
<s> I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
<s> C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
<s> I been out of action since I got over here five months ago.
<s> So what do I say to this guy?
<s> What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.
<s> ...Let me just show you.
<s> The weather.
<s> -- Yes.
<s> Good question.
<s> There's enough for everybody!
<s> What do you mean "basically"?
<s> They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
<s> I don't want to talk about it.
<s> Ma! Hold him!
<s> Go right ahead.
<s> Fine thing Jim Taylor wished on me-- show him the monuments--I need this job like I need ten pounds.
<s> You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
<s> They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
<s> Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.
<s> Oh, hello darling.
<s> Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
<s> Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
<s> "There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"
<s> No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
<s> No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
<s> Doc.  Ainge...
<s> Why do you watch?
<s> Don't you like this?
<s> Things got a lot worse.
<s> We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
<s> Really?
<s> Me, too.
<s> No.
<s> From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.
<s> And I can go free?
<s> Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's car?
<s> Wait for what?
<s> John, don't be mad! Don't be mad! I was just playing with it! I didn't tell no one!
<s> You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
<s> Under the stone in the floor.
<s> One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
<s> We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
<s> A funny story?
<s> Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.
<s> I thought the gloves were off.
<s> We'll see about that.
<s> Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
<s> ...I... I know what you are.
<s> We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
<s> "Injuns?"
<s> I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
<s> But it can't wait.
<s> I know.
<s> Do you?
<s> Father?
<s> You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
<s> -- then we never would have met.
<s> That's right.  And making me was the biggest mistake you ever made!
<s> In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
<s> Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
<s> Daniel, I didn't hear you come down...
<s> Yeah?
<s> Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come!
<s> Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
<s> Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
<s> Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other?
<s> They don't have that kind of potential.
<s> Oh ... Right.
<s> Do you like porno movies?
<s> This is not cool.
<s> YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER. YOU HURT HER.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
<s> Thank you, sir. She begins to leave
<s> No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
<s> This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and- coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right?
<s> Are you drunk?
<s> You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
<s> Gunnison?
<s> I just want to show you how foolish you are.  When you're older you'll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important--
<s> I don't know.  End up in the electric chair?
<s> I've got a gun.
<s> It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm nervous or something--
<s> ...ttt..tt... two out of three?
<s> Yeah, those guys too.
<s> I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
<s> Okay... maybe that would be best.
<s> So, whatever happened to her?
<s> I'm totally freakin' dude. I keep having these nightmares, then I wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. I can't take it anymore, man.
<s> Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
<s> You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
<s> I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
<s> Maybe you want to go.
<s> You touch my spleen, Rollo.  And here all the time I was thinking -- if I ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's happy.
<s> Why are you so hostile? I know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile.  Here.
<s> Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
<s> That's why I'm here.
<s> That ain't right.
<s> What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
<s> Why would they stop you?
<s> Is that why she left you?
<s> You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
<s> Out.
<s> A what?
<s> The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally.
<s> You didn't like him?
<s> Could be, I guess.
<s> Call me next week.  We'll talk about it.
<s> I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
<s> I-- uh--
<s> Does it have a human name?
<s> Do you mind if I come too?
<s> Precise equipment such as waldos
<s> She'll never forgive me!
<s> Yes, yes, it is.
<s> Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
<s> I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> ... My shoes...
<s> A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
<s> This way!
<s> Data doesn't breathe.
<s> I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
<s> And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.
<s> I'm having the garbage searched. If my surmise is correct these boots will cling to the killers' necks like Tiberian bats. They couldn't make their escape without them; nor can they simply throw them out a window for all to see; no - they're here. Somewhere.
<s> She's a predator.
<s> You can stop. I will go on alone.
<s> I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
<s> It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
<s> No, it's not.
<s> This isn't in our database?
<s> What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
<s> What are they doing here?
<s> Yea, how much?
<s> The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.  Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
<s> I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
<s> Sure.
<s> I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
<s> Could you see anything?
<s> I don't smoke?
<s> Who... are they?
<s> Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
<s> No.  Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did.  Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor.  I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em.  I didn't believe in what they were saying.  Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!
<s> Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
<s> Shhh. Shhhhh.
<s> Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
<s> Good morning.
<s> Thank you... Have you any news?
<s> C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
<s> Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
<s> Could be anything... Men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...
<s> You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
<s> I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
<s> No, it hasn't.
<s> Mom, he just fixed our car.
<s> Where are you going?
<s> Of course.  Of course!  Where?  Can't I bring it to you?  For God's sake, baby, please, just tell me what's happened, what could possibly be so bad?
<s> Just what is that supposed to mean?
<s> Don't you fall apart on me. Goddamnit, Thelma.  Every time we get in trouble, you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit, and this time... Not this time. Everything's changed now... Now you can do whatever you want, but I'm going to Mexico.  I'm going.  Are you coming with me?
<s> About how fast was I going?
<s> Yeah, right.
<s> From high school Mary? Yeah, I saw her about six months ago at a convention in Las Vegas.
<s> Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
<s> Did you study under Kim Greene?
<s> He's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come out without a fight.
<s> Yeow!
<s> Hell you did.  Your turn.
<s> Right.  We plan ahead.  That way we don't do anything right now.  Earl explained it to me.
<s> Argumentative.
<s> The later events have never been kept a secret.
<s> Brother, I hear you talkin'.
<s> Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.
<s> I'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I'm comin' to get her. You call soon's you got somethin', even if it's three in the a.m.
<s> Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
<s> Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?
<s> What if I told you not to?
<s> First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
<s> I spoke with the woman who saved your life. You're lucky she came along when she did.
<s> No thanks. I'm fine without them.
<s> I never said that.
<s> Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
<s> Ms. Kramer.
<s> How many girls did you molest?
<s> Hey, you okay?
<s> I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
<s> You shouldn't always take me seriously. Actually, I'm used to it by now. First my mother and now my husband; both of them are like dynamos.
<s> Why?
<s> Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him.
<s> I'm concerned about her health.
<s> Wake up!
<s> Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?
<s> I'll see what I can do.
<s> Here, let me try.
<s> It's time for drastic remedies.
<s> Just a second.  Those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content.
<s> It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
<s> Hey, fair enough.  If you won't come, I'll handle it myself.
<s> Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
<s> So full of meaning, fire and music!
<s> I don't care if I never get home.
<s> Well - if she's got to pick on someone, I'd just as soon it was me.
<s> I don't intend to be.
<s> Not at all...
<s> They're your fans, your audience-
<s> Then Barker withdrew the 25 thousand in hundred dollar bills and gave it back to Liddy who gave it back to me and I put it in the office safe which was crammed.
<s> No, "Charming" is old.  "Older" is <u>really</u> old.  "Youthful mind" is dead.
<s> What...?
<s> The ADM! Quickly! Where is it?!
<s> She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to
<s> What do you mean?
<s> No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.
<s> Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.
<s> Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.
<s> Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
<s> Fantastic.  Out here.
<s> Hello?  Last birthday was?
<s> Me too.
<s> Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
<s> You're not serious.
<s> No, never.
<s> Are you asking me to marry you?
<s> No, really, five thousand with your discount.
<s> Water...water -- oh, you already said that.
<s> Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again?
<s> Good night.
<s> How is your cold?
<s> You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
<s> I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
<s> Call me what, sir?
<s> We'll exterminate the fuckers !
<s> 157  CONTINUED:
<s> That's right.  You're not.
<s> No. No. Get Carol.
<s> Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
<s> No.  It's the truth.  I know what you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  You don't have a social security number.  You don't pay taxes.  You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  You think you can do it again.  But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you.
<s> Because I want to know.
<s> Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
<s> Fuck you!
<s> A drill, what are you up to?
<s> It's time to go home, Holly.
<s> I didn't say you did.
<s> Eileen, Chinese food again?
<s> What're you doing?
<s> Just 'grazed' you, huh?
<s> She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
<s> Seems like nothing but, lately.
<s> Funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime  when he can fit it into a little box like that. I guess... I guess it's kind of pathetic.
<s> Thanks.
<s> When I was poor, everybody doubted I could make it. When I got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I clean up, and then they say `Look. His art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway. I'm healthy now.
<s> Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me.
<s> Alfred's happy here.
<s> Just the beast.
<s> I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
<s> Mystery.
<s> What?  I improved her a little...
<s> Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
<s> Of course he is.
<s> What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
<s> Yes, so do we.
<s> I agree.
<s> Tomorrow. We're late for Lester.
<s> Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
<s> Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
<s> I don't know. I think I've lost my mother, Paul D.
<s> I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
<s> Aw, no, Ella.
<s> They were Nazis, Dude?
<s> The main guy, Dieter--
<s> Get your goddamn--
<s> Both. Now.
<s> Asleep--
<s> Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
<s> Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
<s> Here's to Ben.
<s> My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
<s> You better not, Jeffrey.
<s> What is it?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
<s> Why, yes, of course ... But for the moment, let's be satisfied with Algiers! In the mountains our work is always easier.
<s> Yes.
<s> You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
<s> Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
<s> What?
<s> I can't carry it in my pocket, man.  And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop.  You gonna have to pick it up yourself.
<s> What do you want to do?
<s> Nothing.  It's just not there.
<s> All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers --
<s> Abbott wants to talk.
<s> I told you.  You need to rest.
<s> I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
<s> Fixed itself.
<s> What if there is no tomorrow?
<s> Mary, we really have to go.
<s> He's better, though, right?
<s> I understand.  I'll go with you.
<s> No stop where he's all besieged.
<s> Better!
<s> Walter!  Jeez!
<s> I forgot.
<s> Don't you see what's happening? You're changing.  You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of.  God, this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
<s> No --
<s> Oh, please.
<s> I'm not a real batter.  I'm a woman.
<s> God--what a Big League move.
<s> ...this check for $62,700,000 for the new Tangiers.
<s> Ginger.
<s> Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.
<s> It's me.
<s> No, Ace.
<s> Yeah, I know all that.
<s> It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
<s> But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
<s> I don't - 
<s> Okay, yeah.
<s> I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
<s> This Mercedes of yours, what's it look like?
<s> There isn't any such person.
<s> Must be.
<s> He wants me to perform for him.
<s> Got to be somewhere.
<s> Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care.
<s> Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
<s> Agent.
<s> First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
<s> This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
<s> 
<s> Okay.  Come on, big guy!
<s> Sir, we can't just let him get away with this!
<s> INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY. 
<s> Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.
<s> And why's that?
<s> I got back today. You can't imagine the excuses I had to make up to be here...
<s> I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected.  I don't care whether they know what I know about him.  Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral -  Champeen of the people.  Just as long as -
<s> Nothing - if she dosen't love me -
<s> I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie.  We'll let the salary stay where it is.
<s> Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
<s> Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Why not?
<s> Living proof.
<s> Veronica.
<s> I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
<s> I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
<s> What happened to you?
<s> I can't promise you anything.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> Reagan didn't die.  If he had died, everybody would know what Johnny's middle name was.
<s> Could you be a little more specific?
<s> I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
<s> If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?
<s> Are you threatening me?
<s> Boss, you don't need reasons to hit me.
<s> We ain't goin' nowhere.
<s> I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
<s> I've already made arrangements.
<s> Lie?
<s> It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
<s> So, I've been thinking a lot...
<s> All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
<s> Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
<s> This Jade Fox is a woman?
<s> Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
<s> Spare your energy.  I'll be back!
<s> What I've always wanted, to teach you.
<s> How was your date?
<s> Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.
<s> I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language.
<s> Jesus!
<s> I need to talk to Annette.
<s> I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
<s> Yes, Amy.
<s> Yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome.
<s> Yes, that's what we're looking for.
<s> How big?
<s> Meeks.
<s> Oh, Captain, My Captain. Is there poetry in math?
<s> Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
<s> Commissioner Gallagher said...  ...twenty years is a long time.
<s> Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
<s> Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
<s> Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
<s> Mary!
<s> Fuck you, sir - if I'm right, I don't need you.  What I want is - if I make an honest mistake I want help.
<s> That's why I can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny.  You got to merge your whole soul with God.  And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost.
<s> I don't forget about Sal and the boom boom room.  I want you to see this.
<s> They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual.  I want you to stop them saying that.
<s> YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
<s> Claremont said we deliver the First Ladies in Needles. Then we go home. No questions asked.
<s> He's completely innocent.
<s> That's what I think.
<s> Yeah, no more ninety-minute deliveries around the corner.
<s> Guys. Give me the two fifty and go away.
<s> Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
<s> Me, too. This is my favorite part of the tape.
<s> This is the big moment...!
<s> That's ridiculous.
<s> What's uncanny?
<s> What?
<s> A woman wants to be pursued.
<s> I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
<s> What kind of person?
<s> No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
<s> Me?  You called it.  I got a message that...
<s> Say what and so what.
<s> Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
<s> I don't want to go back.
<s> The rest meant nothing to me.
<s> Thank you.
<s> I'm afraid so, sir. Kip hurries to his tent.  Hana follows him.
<s> Meaning no one arranges calalilies like that. He left the window open when he came in. His only mistake.
<s> Give him the card.
<s> Get out of here!
<s> The early bird gets the damn worm.
<s> You got more than one?
<s> Han, we need you here.
<s> Foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and dangerous too.  You have far to go in your training.
<s> I'm here.
<s> 'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up.
<s> What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?
<s> You wanted to see me, Charlie?
<s> Huh?
<s> So?  The procnias averano is a South American bird.  The flight here was only three hours!  And yesterday a European swallow flew by! Where the fuck are we?
<s> Great.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Youre jumping, sweetheart...
<s> Just until the Deutsche Mark turns...
<s> Jack...God, its been so long...You look...
<s> Congratulations. The La Guardia flights canceled but I got you out of Kennedy on United at nine. Am I good or what?
<s> What about Dr. Michaels?
<s> I know it's a lot.
<s> Fuck your struggle.  I want out.
<s> You think you are... .
<s> <u>What</u>!?
<s> God... I'm the janitor of God.
<s> I don't know.
<s> In a minute!
<s> Cash or check, Jazz?  Don't do this to me.
<s> The case!
<s> No. 
<s> One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
<s> What?
<s> What...
<s> I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off.
<s> Yes.
<s> And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
<s> She's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you.  Has he brought it back on course yet?
<s> Yeah...a lot.
<s> Give me the degrees first, followed by minutes and sec...
<s> I want to go home. I want off this ship.
<s> Right here. At the door.
<s> Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu.  That I find hard to bear -- even in prison.
<s> I thought you were against fighting.
<s> Any particular reason?
<s> I hope he's not just a body.
<s> I'm good at that.
<s> Just sandwiches...
<s> Sod off.
<s> What two?
<s> Not lately you can't...
<s> That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
<s> You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...
<s> Fuck you.
<s> One moment, I'll be right with you.  In fact, a...one point, which I spoke to you of which  I can't talk to you about here.
<s> Let's go.
<s> Keep them alive.
<s> I won't keep you another minute...
<s> I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
<s> You mean, like posed for pictures?
<s> I don't like to talk about that.
<s> I thought I'd give you a hand since I kept you open.
<s> A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?
<s> Every day. I wonder about that every day...
<s> We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all
<s> On account of me.
<s> No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
<s> Yes.
<s> You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
<s> They don't come over here that much.
<s> Awright. An' if she gets outa han', I'll be in the right han' corner, this side the dance floor.
<s> Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
<s> -Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
<s> A jogger, huh?
<s> I said... I started.
<s> What?
<s> Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
<s> Never heard of you. Done anything?
<s> Annie!
<s> I can't say anything!
<s> Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.
<s> Uh-oh.
<s> I just want a salad.  You really think I'm a loser, don't you?
<s> 'bout time you <u>learned</u>...
<s> ....because we don't have any mmm...
<s> What shape is the scar?
<s> Well, no...  That's... I appreciate your <u>help</u>, but... 
<s> What does <u>that</u> mean?
<s> I guess.
<s> Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom?
<s> Oh -- great.
<s> Yeah -- we know him.  He's been hanging around the house.
<s> And I can't help having a cold.
<s> Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.
<s> My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.
<s> Then we don't know if she's part of this or not.  Mickey, you up?
<s> Yes, sir. What is wrong?
<s> We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
<s> So where is the lamb?
<s> It can't hurt you if you're not afraid Aubrey.  Think about us. We're here for you, we love you...
<s> What is it?
<s> Actually I wrote it.  It's a good sentence.  It can apply to people.
<s> Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
<s> And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
<s> -- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce? The very thought --
<s> Do you think so?
<s> I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
<s> Yes...
<s> We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
<s> See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it.  Some folks just can't sail.
<s> Made what?
<s> That's the best part of it. They've appointed George here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
<s> Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
<s> Don't hurt my ear again!
<s> Oh, George.
<s> Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
<s> That's what he said.
<s> Balance, Kelly.  Bal-lance!
<s> Precisely.
<s> Then don't come any closer.
<s> I can't help it....
<s> What's going on?
<s> The readings suck....
<s> Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
<s> I'm already walking. Where is it?
<s> Okay.
<s> Nothing.
<s> I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
<s> Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
<s> Well, I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch.  You go.
<s> What does he mean by "target audience"?
<s> Miss Daniel? My name is Klute -- John Klute --
<s> Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on.
<s> But, I am in charge.
<s> Are you, General?
<s> Never been to Maine before?
<s> Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.
<s> Alright, Jack!
<s> Yes.
<s> Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
<s> No.
<s> I can't see them!
<s> I mean it, there is only three of us here.
<s> When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.
<s> If I stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine--
<s> You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
<s> The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
<s> Fuck you.
<s> And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
<s> It happens, right...
<s> I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia. I'm sick.
<s> No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
<s> You're her boyfriend?
<s> 818-753-0088.
<s> We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy.
<s> He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
<s> Please, no.
<s> When we were cleaning out Dr. Lector's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book... We got him out of there and dug around...
<s> I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.
<s> Go on to the house...
<s> I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places.
<s> Who knows?!  That kid is totally meshuga.
<s> Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
<s> He'll be here.  Look, take this for now.
<s> What do they expect you to say?
<s> What was it?
<s> None facety, mistah.  You come for me?  Dat's good news.
<s> Yes?
<s> It's time to put this person where he belongs.
<s> Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
<s> I'm having a helluva time.
<s> And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?
<s> She's dead...
<s> How do I know?  But it was from the get-go.  Knew the FBI had run me into them.  Sonny, I gotta go...!
<s> They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...
<s> What?
<s> Oh, Jesus.
<s> It has no nobility.
<s> I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
<s> Sure!
<s> But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
<s> And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?
<s> Course it's a good idea.
<s> Back to your bed!  At once!
<s> The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
<s> "I came back. I thought that's what you wanted."
<s> 43 unpaid parking tickets, sir.
<s> No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.
<s> Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
<s> Oh no?!?!?!
<s> Well you don't know that. Ask him.
<s> This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married.
<s> It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.
<s> Could I get a Coke for Mickey?
<s> Really?
<s> Yeah.
<s> The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
<s> Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
<s> Yes, desperately.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Oh sure.  That's just the sorta thing parents tell their kids:  "Goodnight honey.  Don't forget ot say your prayers. Oh, by the way, your father and I torched some maniac last night."
<s> Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
<s> Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
<s> Well, okay, but I just want to look at the facilities. That's all.
<s> No! I wanna go!
<s> I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember.  With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun...  And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis.
<s> That's really romantic.
<s> Don't say that!
<s> Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
<s> Of course I do.
<s> At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
<s> Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
<s> Power dive!
<s> Were.  Isn't that what you mean?  Were. Because he's dead, isn't he?  And that's why you've come.
<s> Rejected, worthless, miserable.
<s> Wrong, Dad. Your idea.
<s> It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
<s> Any settlement agreement <u>must</u> include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work.
<s> Dr. J.!
<s> You have to make a decision: is this guy partner material?
<s> Said "looks clear."
<s> In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
<s> You're not English.
<s> And you're so beautiful.  What are you doing here?
<s> Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
<s> Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.
<s> Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
<s> You're forgiven.
<s> Did you?
<s> Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
<s> Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.
<s> And what am I?
<s> As you wish.
<s> What?
<s> Mr. Bialystock ...
<s> Of course not. Please.
<s> Are we just going to go on sitting here?
<s> Neither will I.
<s> Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite.
<s> Well, it's not very plain.
<s> There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.
<s> Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.
<s> You, too.
<s> Oh no no no no.
<s> Ohh!
<s> ...I don't feel heat from the name.
<s> ...It's cold outside, Paulie.
<s> Yeah, that's better.
<s> Romeo will answer it?
<s> She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
<s> Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee.
<s> What are you gonna do?
<s> Nothing happened?
<s> Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace!  Is that asking too much?
<s> Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.
<s> Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?
<s> Why don't you go get them?
<s> Let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. You do it again, nobody, not Rhonda, not Yolanda, gonna save your ass.
<s> I merely write the stuff.  You're the one that serves it up.
<s> And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.
<s> Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
<s> Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
<s> And you admire that?
<s> Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
<s> Oskar, please -
<s> Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
<s> Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
<s> Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
<s> Yeah, we just watched a few movies. Took a few notes. It was fun.
<s> Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> And what would be your motive?
<s> Why are you doing this?
<s> I don't know...
<s> Is there any blood in it?
<s> Yeah.  Parts of them.  Anyway, in Purgatory, Dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain... seeing all these other guys who sinned...
<s> Like, because someone's holding a gun on you.
<s> Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
<s> What do we do now?
<s> Go on.
<s> I would have made you immortal.  Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare.
<s> I haven't lost yet.
<s> Cover it?
<s> I don't know.
<s> The lawn -- it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it?
<s> Well, like what?
<s> Really? How about starting with tonight?
<s> There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
<s> Well... thank you.
<s> Now stop that.  You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience.  I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if she understood.
<s> Very well.  I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger.  Thank-you.
<s> Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
<s> You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
<s> He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.
<s> How are you, Bill?
<s> I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.
<s> I don't reckon I know.
<s> Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.
<s> Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
<s> Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
<s> Excuse me for asking, but you aren't married, are you?
<s> No, you don't.
<s> Hey, she's ticklish!
<s> As far away as possible.
<s> Of course not.  As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  You see he needs help.
<s> I slept with your sister.
<s> About what?
<s> Yeah, I know Bill, I came up with the plan remember?  Just have those hangar doors open and ready, I can take it from there.
<s> There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!
<s> They've left, keep watching!
<s> How do you spell it?
<s> I don't know, Zander.
<s> Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
<s> Evening, Cal.  Would you tell me about it?
<s> Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
<s> What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
<s> I don't drink.
<s> Find the money.
<s> Sherry, this...
<s> Ain't no second chances in life.
<s> No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
<s> Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.
<s> How about the promises we make to our kids?  About <u>their</u> future.  Do we shrug those off, just that easily?
<s> Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
<s> We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
<s> Admiral Buldike?
<s> Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?
<s> Di?  I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.
<s> He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there.  It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
<s> Why?
<s> Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
<s> Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
<s> This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
<s> Nobody else.
<s> Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
<s> Yes.  He does.
<s> You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
<s> And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank.
<s> Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?
<s> But not for anything I did today...
<s> The man in jail is always for freedom.
<s> Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
<s> Thank you.  Goodnight.
<s> Your brother.  Will you come with me?
<s> All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
<s> Sounds like Beverly Hills.
<s> Did you.  What was that in aid of?
<s> The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
<s> No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.
<s> Don't stop now.
<s> No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.
<s> Because his mother got sick - very sick.  He couldn't leave her.  He's a kind boy, maybe too kind.
<s> Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.
<s> I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
<s> General McAddie's.
<s> No.
<s> Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?
<s> I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
<s> ...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
<s> From the Rhineland originally.
<s> Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and I've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking. What are you listening to?
<s> You found the leopard!
<s> She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
<s> Paul Lamont...?
<s> You wouldnt be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
<s> Do you think this cross will protect you?
<s> You're out, aren't you?
<s> I was listening, Kitten.
<s> No.
<s> Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.
<s> If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
<s> I wonder if they've --  I don't want to hear anything about it.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I told you.  He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.
<s> Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.
<s> Yeah, you're funny.
<s> Don't let them separate us.
<s> Out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.
<s> Yes...
<s> Then let's go see what they missed.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
<s> Smart. London, eh?
<s> Certainly!
<s> Then I mislay my checkbook--
<s> Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
<s> He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
<s> It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
<s> No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
<s> Crack me back of the head like Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you Ain't no fightin' man, you're Just a cop.
<s> Yeah, you look it.
<s> Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
<s> It's a lousy job, but -  The only reason I stay is for the health benefits.
<s> It's all right, Finn.
<s> So you pay off our customs officials?
<s> Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
<s> Go, Sulu.
<s> He lies!  I was there!  I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.
<s> Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
<s> Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
<s> She seems very nice.
<s> I'm here about some monkeys.
<s> If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
<s> Vat? I am going 5 miles an hour! I am looking town. I not even moving.
<s> Seventy-five percent.
<s> The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head.
<s> Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
<s> Same one as shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?
<s> I don't like the question.
<s> County. I was in for fraud.
<s> Yes.
<s> Her doctors killed her.
<s> Dr. Gruber's not in.
<s> So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
<s> Yes.
<s> What does Moore have to do with your growing?
<s> I got to agree with that.
<s> I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?
<s> Fine. Never felt better in my life.  See, I'm a good liar.
<s> Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
<s> But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
<s> Some, military... Special Program, Oklahoma somewhere...
<s> They look stupid.
<s> ...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
<s> I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares. I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and I'm expecting your commitment.
<s> Very much.
<s> Claire, please...
<s> I have something I have to show you...
<s> I better go, Dad.
<s> We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
<s> I know.
<s> What is all this? When are you coming home?
<s> As above, so below.
<s> Friend of yours?
<s> No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
<s> Is morally, ethic'ly
<s> Why don't you try counting sheep?
<s> Hes not through yet. Renard doesnt blow up five million dollars unless he knows theres more coming in. Hes working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
<s> I have to go to work.
<s> His . . . whatever.
<s> Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
<s> You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
<s> Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
