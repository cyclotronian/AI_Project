No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
That I'm used to.
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Can't you stay with us a little?
You better get packed.
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.
Is it drug related?
Are you married?
It's easy to learn.
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
Welcome home.
Snuff?
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
Dad!
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.
He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens.
Find them everywhere. 
Striker.
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
In there.
Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?
What's he scanning for?
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
Opera? Opera!
Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I
The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.
I got seven thousand.
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
So -- how far are we from the campus?
Not a good time to lose one's head.
Here, have a piece of gum.
I saw it.
Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.
You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.
Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?
Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid?
You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.
I need to uh...
Holy shit.
This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it.
Gal, you ain't right yet.
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
What are you saying?
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
I... I blacked out.
I don't get it.
How did you get in?
Yes, Victor, I was.
I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
And never take.
You want that delivered, we'll deliver it.  That's what we do.
I thought it was my turn.
You okay, Rose?
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?
Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.
And I thought you were only after my body.
Yeah.
No wire.
I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.
You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. Name?
No I don't.  She worries about you.
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.
Yes John?
Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other.
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
Joel? It's Joel, right?
You said...
Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
Captain Miller, you copy?
Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.
So what did you do?
Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
I'll bet.
It's okay.
Now you've got him started.
Philosophical?
It's just this place. The storm. That's why you're all upset.
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
What's your frank estimation of the British?
The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill.  With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.
Sir, please accept my commission from Congress... and...  You must see this portrait of my beautiful wife, Adrienne, we had the most perfect little baby girl just before I left.  Her name is Henriette...
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
For a movie?
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
It doesn't pay very much, but I should be able to afford my own place in a few months... Do you think that's too soon? I'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage...
Starting now, we attack them.
Endorse me in public.  Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates.  I know you would give anything to be outside again.  Endorse me and you will be free.  Think of it.  What would you do with your freedom?
I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
You're trembling.
Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.
Insolent young cub!
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
He retired.
That's natural.
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where?
Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.
Man, how many girls do you need?
Ssh. I'm on a stakeout.
Come again.
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
Got tired of me?
But you said --
Need any help?
Not the point.
Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place?  Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
I knew his great-grandfather.
I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!
Mother? But your mother --
You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me.
Did you get that, Hildy?
Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to.
Thanks to you, Nate.
I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.
Seventy-five per cent.
Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
Knock it off. You're not mad.
You're in my head...
Corridor A.
And on my time.
...drink it.
She's so lovely. It's all my fault...I was wrong.
What did you say?
Where what?
ABC Telemarketing Company.
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
How is she?
I knocked several times.
Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston.  "Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible." Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston.
Never mind, son. She doesn't want it. 
SorryI didn't mean to
And if you're wrong?
Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say. 
I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.
You okay?
I'm going out for a few hours.
Hello.  Hey, Jackie...  No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
Where's West? New Jersey?
Spunky . . .
You're being really immature.
You lose!
Well, I think I've had enough.
Have they harmed you?
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
Friend Ogg.  Excuse our enthusiasm, occasioned as it was by a fondness for you.
Here now.  Toss her this when you've the chance.  Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass.  She's terribly vain.  Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle.
Ride like wild fire, Jack.
A gentleman would offer water.
How so?
I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.
Do you need anything?  I'll go to the pharmacy.  I have some Demerol at home.
I know you're not talking to me...
What are you in for, Willie?
No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
How long have you been living here?
Well? How do you like it?
Do you own a video camera?
Who's it from?
In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
Sorry.  Old habit.  I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.  My father was a minister.  Lutheran.
Thank you very much, sir.
So, when's the drop.
How'd they know who you were?
What about it?
It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
What they call you?
What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
Where does he live?
Good news. You're going back to school.
Tell me about your friend Creasy.
Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because I promised Mr. Gazzara I'd let him know tomorrow. See, what I wanna know, Tom, if a buncha individual retail merchants get together, how does it operate? On individual mark- ups? You know what I mean? Say I'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli, he's the dairyman and grocer, so suppose I mark up thirty-five percent, but he works on forty, so...
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
Is that liquor?
I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a <u>putz</u> - and I should know. I'm his little brother.
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
My first name's--Clarissa.
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
Why don't you do it yourself?
Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?
He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. They're getting a trifle impatient, sir.
Yes. Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
You're doing great.
And that's your secret?  You meant -- like a trade secret?
He'll never make it.
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.
And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something.
Don't do it, please.
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
Leon! What in heaven's name...!
I promised Iran to Townsend.
Helms wants Iran or there might be problems.  All of his old CIA buddies are over there making a fortune off the Shah.
Don't ever trust them.  They never tell the truth or honor their commitments.  Vietnamese are like Russians.  Both are dogs.
We lost ...
You don't have to go.
What airport would you use.
Do you know who I am?
How did you know?
I said 'got it?'
And she always had such spirit! But, after her mother died...
The preacher said it absolved us.
Whatever you say, Mayonnaise.
That was great.
Call me during the week if you get the chance.
And we're never getting in.
What?!
One: "We want freedom. We want the power to determine the destiny of our Black Community." Two: "We want full employment for our people." Three: "We want to end the robbery by the white man of our Black Community." Christ, they're asking for reparations...
No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
Hey--they actually found the place!
Here, kid, this is great stuff.  Why don't you give it a try?
Oh no, no, no.  No can do.  You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez!  You've got to learn to take responsibility!
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Yes ...  It's just that ...
Yes.
You lied to me?
Of course, it's just for us to verify your credit card information. It's completely confidential and it appears on your credit card billing statement as D&D Mattress Man.
Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
You gonna watch?
Orson, you wanna take five?
What?
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
Oh, I do that all the time. Whenever I have a few minutes after lunch.
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
No.  I definitely don't.  I did the sa--
Hi, Plato!
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.
And you're all alone.
What a bitch!
Yeah! Oohhhh! Get it!
What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
...free-lance. You know.
I just thought it might --
Do I know you?
Yeah. Tight.
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
So what do you think?
I can't even imagine.
Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world.  Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill?
Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay.
Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett. He's a friend of mine.  This is Sheriff Cobb.
Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.
My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon.
That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until I get a court order for a blood test.
Would you like me to read?
Goodnight, Malcolm.
I don't know how else to look--
I came back for the funeral. That's all.
I hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen Beaners up to West Virginia.
What are you doin' now?
How bad?
Is that really what you want?
You gotta get another tour.  We're gettin' too old for this.
"Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."
Would you cool it already?
-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.
Stop that, will you!  Those idiots! So they sprang Dunbar! So what good is it? He's still in the compound, isn't he? How long can he last? Where can they hide him?
What DO you want? Damn it, why isn't there a girl here? You know this has nothing to do with age. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies.
Time's up, Admiral...
Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
That was close --
With pleasure.
Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
Juice?
Their com system must still be down.
Captain, I've found the Borg Sphere. It's on the far side of the planet...firing at the surface.
What are they doing?
And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The record clearly there were no other ships in the sector.
From Starfleet?
An accident wasn't good enough...
But we haven't run out of history just yet.  Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - "the undiscovered country"...
Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing.
What do you imagine this is?
George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
Are you from up there? Space?
I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
No, man. I need to use the phone.
No.  You ask for too much.
Hey, beautiful girls!
Okay.
Yeah. We went to Harvard together. 
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
I think it's safe to get out now.
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?
I heard you were looking for this.
Would such, a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
What do you mean "got" to the dog?
... Thousands and thousands of people.  And sometimes we live in great buildings that reach up five or ten stories.
You know of them?
Say I just come back again?
Now I know you're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget.
What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything.
You want a drink?
Honey?
We gotta be inconspicuous.  Do you know what that means?
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know if I'm ready for this, man.
Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
You don't think they're too big?
South Dakota...  Did I do something unsatisfactory, Sir?
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.
Now let's get down to business.  Kuato wants what's in Quaid's head.  And he might be able to get it, cause they say he's psychic.  Now I have a little plan to keep this from happening.  --Do you think you can play along?
Oh shit....Oh shit...
Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!
Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
Eddie -- it's Art Esparza!
Mr. Ortega, you've known the defendant at Ossining Correctional for how long?
Bobby's got it.
Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed...?
You okay?
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
I'd just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one, if it's same to you.
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
You got me, peanut.
You're scarin' me, baby.
Simple? Kill him? How?
Wrong! It's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head... right toward the bridge of the nose... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.
I'm gonna take your silence as a "yes"...
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
Christ, Tripp. How did you know?
Kind of a sign, you're saying.
Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.
Oh?
A pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends.
And when you sit by the window, watching the girls in the little cotton skirts parade by, do you wave your wanger at the girls? Is that when you jerk off?
I'd say you're moving.
Is that what you are angry about?
Maybe this isn't a good idea.
Stay away from me...
Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
I see you go to the night court.
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
What would you say that was supposed to mean?
That next thing there -- six legs, tentacles -- that's the thing we saw in the food locker.
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.
C'mon, man.  One more sweep.
What with taxes coming up - and since I'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well, I've been thinking...
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP--
Are you kidding?  No.
What's up, fellas?
You ever hear of something called The Bible?
Our last game is this Saturday.
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
Because Gaston was after it.
Jesus...
Shit. I feel sick.
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
You'll laugh.
No, I got time.
yes, we had, uh...
Here you are. There's people out there.
I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
M'hm.
Cal, my wife Judy.
Fuck you.
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
General -- we have to talk sometime!
So what makes you so special?
I was sort of wondering what you looked like. Sit down.
Oh.
Sir?
It's really too much -- I mean I've collected every picture of her since she was Miss December.
I never heard about that.
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
You've gone crazy.
No -- I don't want to sleep. I want to think. Water. Give me water.
Still playing by the rules.  You're a damn good kiler.
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
He'll kill us.
No -- no, Captain.
Watch it with Meyerling.  Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.
All this for laying traps on private land?
It's amazing these things weren't done.
No... no thank you notes.
Nice of you... thank you.
My son.
Simon, you've got to get dressed.
A fine specimen for conversion.
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
I'll try to slip out. If he quiets down, passes out... I'm afraid he thinks  well, he said you were a buffoon, Barton. He becomes irrational
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
Have you been camping? You could use a scrub.
She's the first woman in a long time that's... No. She's the first woman ever. And she loves Batman. Not Bruce Wayne. If I let go of Batman I'll lose her.
Holy shit.
No.
Peanuts?
Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...
This is Elmer, our longest serving...
Heh heh. Fire. Heh heh Aaaaeeehhhhg!!!
Hell is other people.  You obviously don't read much. Besides things seem pretty quiet here.  You should thank God you didn't die in Italy.  The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been studying the manual?
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
Answer your mother.
I swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, I've got my hands full...  ... Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably...  ... Any pain here?
Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.
... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be...  I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?
Yes, Eve. That would be good.
Failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells... Not a damn thing they can do about it. Oh, they can make me comfortable, prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions... And what makes my blood boil, what little I have left, that is, Mr. Gardiner - is that it's generally a young person's disease... Here I am, getting on in years and about to die of a young person's disease...
It's starting to swell, is it painful?
... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?
Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.
Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
... This is another world, Tom - I never would have believed it...
Sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments.
Say, aren't you that actor guy?
I know.
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
That's the key to the city of Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was given two years ago in recognition of his various civic, uh.
No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--
What the fuck?
Get in. Youre leaving.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
On the plane.
No honey, I'm alright.
Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie.  Why don't we start small?
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
Barbara.
Okay.  So we need a source.  Where do we start?
Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...
I would have missed it -- but the phone rang and I let it play while I talked.  It looks like blank tape -- but it isn't.  It's been erased without any input signal coming in.
Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.
What kind of condition are you referring to?
Then why did you go see Mr. Koehler in the first place?
You ought to write these stories down.
...Bones ol' Bones so mean and bad, whupped his mamma, shot his dad.
Are they on the radio?
He probably thinks he's saving you from something.  I'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
What are we doing down here?
You're right.  One of my associates sold the building last month.
Caesar?  What is this?
I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
OK. What's in the parcel?
Security.
That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime.
It's not worth it, Tom. He's surrendering.
No.  That's not going to tell us anything.  Let's get this prompter going.
How'd it go?
If we could just eat first.
You're even weaker than the others.
You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're pissing it away.
You're with me now.
I bought him a watch too.
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
I fucked up, Frankie. I fucked up good this time. Should have never started with this fuckin' broad.
Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."
"Save the City?" I don't want to save the city, I want to move!  Listen, I'm sure the computer disc is pretty fascinating and I can't thank you enough for the little weird gold thingie, but..
Was someone in an accident?
I thought you said you could handle him.
I want you all in one vehicle. Your van.  If I see anybody else cruising around I'll keep going. No second chances.  You can kill them and I'll keep what I've got.
The 405 is coming up.
Look, I'm sorry.
And what's it like?
Ours.
There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss.
Voil what?
Now don't be nervous.
...here.   Mason... 
What the hell is all this about a detonation today?  We're scheduled...

Well, you don't look any the worse for wear, Mr. Gittes, I must say... where's the girl?...
Just to be certain, I wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
Do you know me?
I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help.
Why don't you people let me alone? I'm minding my own business.  You mind yours.
Unnhh!
You're kidding.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
It's not what you think.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
Julie Dwyer died.
You're happy?
Like you said-she snowballed him.
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
Twenty bucks?
I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.
Crime?
Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.
Yes?
How many did I get right?
I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
Guy's a C.I.A. shrink.  Here to I.D. Fletcher.  They knew each other somehow.
I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year.
A machine.  But a machine that does what?
Hokkaido Island.
Maybe he's been chain-ganging too long.
Lucille? Where do you get that?
You ain't man enough to wear them!
Mm-hmm.  I can't get to you.  You have to come to me.
That's amazing.  A whole new book, thought up in a minute.  Very good.  All I know how t do is get up, take a shower, and go to work. Hope, if he does another I'll nail the son of bitch, and they'll spell my name right in the newspaper. Where is Andy going?
Will you get time off to do that?
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
What are you doing?    You're going to be late.
I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.
The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.
Well, there used to be!  What's your name?  I'm Lo.  The Hans call me Dark Cloud.  I'm not that tall or big, but I'm quick as lightning.
Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man.  I nearly had a fucking heart attack.
You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.
Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York.
That was cool.
I was just kidding.
But -
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
Because it can't. It's dead.
It all starts with them going to the bathroom together.
I do development for TV movies.
What?
I had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. In fact...you might say that Mr. Tyler is in big trouble with the...authorities.
How're you guys... I mean, how've you guys been?
Funny guy.
Hey, I'm eating.
You should be in hospital.
Granny, when do we move to the new house?
My fault? ... Oh, Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.
I'm afraid not.  But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you?  Just another American who saw too many movies as a child.  Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion.
Yeah.
<i>They can do subtitles.</i>
Promise me... you won't ever tell Domino.
How come you ain't got no brothers up?
By the way, did Captain Rob mention how I beat the crap out of him this afternoon?
You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki.
The Water of Life.
Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?
Are things gonna be okay with you and Mom? Is there anything I can --
points at the motel.
So what's the point?
Here?
He came in four minutes ago.
That ain't me.
It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--
You sing.  All the time.
What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
Before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me?
That's great if you're a computer. In the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. The building's 600 feet high.
If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.
Will you?  You underestimate The Emperor.  It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer.
Good God.
So am I.  And I mean you no harm.
Locked.
Later.
I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
And let my cry come unto thee.
Are you comfortable Regan?
Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about.
I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us <u>worse</u>, maybe even kill us.
This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.
Grant -- wait a minute -- you're not going to dismantle the wireless?
How ya doin', Wade?
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.
Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the plane.  We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.
We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction.  The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin.  In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble.  I know this because Tyler knows this.
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
Well...
Not now, I'm busy
He doesn't read my stuff well.  'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.'  That was stupid, Alan.
Wouldn't they normally be locked?
Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?
Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
Look what I found.  Remember these?
Are they following us?
You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
Lake Forest Green?
Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks.
Everything going okay?
She's beautiful.
We must have been heroic.
I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?
Vincent, where's the shore?  We're too far out. We have to go back!
What will happen to the others?
Yeah.
Your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in Huntsville.
I made a mistake.
Confidential, like.
Thorpey. They were waiting for us in the car park.
What'll they do to him?
Meaning what?
A job with Graff.
Yeah.  You know who doesn't?
Don't.
What was yesterday?
What's this?
That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short.
Fish.
Sound it out for me.
What's the matter?
Okay, okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.?
Where to -- ?
I don't care. Something's going on.
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
Yeah, so he's like "Check the front of my truck, I can prove I hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something"--
What happened?  You got fired, huh?
Do you play the piano?
Well, you said anybody can waltz... How'm *I* doin'?
Women?
I ain't no more a preacher, you know.
Seems like we wasn't never gonna do nothin' but move. I'm so tar'd.
Sure do.
Fust thing I'll get is coffee, cause ever'body been wantin' that, an' then some flour an' bakin' powder an' meat. Better not get no side- meat right off. Save that for later. Maybe Sat'dy. Got to get some soap too. An' milk. Rosasharn's got to have some milk.
Looks like you done it.
Tommy?
Loomis. Haddonfield.
Shit!
That's disgusting!
Why not?
Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
Oh, I'm fine.
And how would you know that?
Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.
She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
What do you want?
Do something.
Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.
No.  Sorry.  Not interested.  Not for my customers.  Have you tried ...
Where do you think you're going?
My daughter. I haven't been on a bike for years.  When was the last time you rode a bike?
Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?
I have to get back.
What plans?
What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?
Their stuff in there...  ...and ours in here.
Checking the locks again?
I'm going.
Go on, Doctor.
Sean.  Sean, where are you?
I see what you're doing....
You looked just like your father... The first time the shark came to Amity....
You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man....
Alright, you got it. And I'll be putting an Observer in with you.
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
Good.  Good.  Glad is good.
Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by a single mother.
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
Go, go, go, jump!
So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?
I saw Mr. Faber.  You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?
Have you discussed this with them?
Goodbye, Kundun.
How big is Tibet's army?
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
You take care.
Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.
Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.
Advance, Sergeant Major!
Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major!
My van is half full.
Spanish in Florida called him Juan Caballo. John Horse.
Fifteen years in El Paso.
There's not that much down here, Colonel. Big O's is the only place in the county that our African American soldiers are uhm--that they feel comfortable in.
I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
I thought you got through that pretty well.
I mean what did we know about anything?
Right.
You could still help me do that.
Great.
Nonsense, it's all of our home.  So how's work treating you?
I can take it.
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?
Is this boyfriend bothering you?
To not do that.  To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
I lost my gun after I left you today and I'm the laughing stock of a lot of people.  I wanted to tell you that. I wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and I feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie about things and I'll tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I'm not a good cop...and I'm looked down at...and I know that....and I'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me.
What happend?
I've heard your tapes on the phone.
--- What was that?
Rose is on the phone and here's the cards for today --
You don't do that, you don't call him, you don't know to get involved in the bussiness of his, of his of <u>my</u> family. this is the <u>family</u>, <u>me</u> and <u>him</u> do you understand?  You understand? NO ONE ELSE. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE.  That man, his son does not exist.  HE IS DEAD.  HE IS DEAD and WHO TOLD YOU TO DO THAT?
No, M'lady.
I cannot betray Louis.  I will defend him with my life.
If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen.
I was just having a little fun -
Do you see?
Do you know something about that?
She got all right?
Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!
What is he doing?
What did she tell you?
How...?!
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
Can you spare it?
Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter.
I think you know --
30.
Like...?
And there's Dmitri...
Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!
Well, this thought just struck me. It wasn't too long ago I was washing dishes way the hell somewhere in Texas.
Sarah's reconsidering.  Claire, transport in five minutes.
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
I'm not letting this list get out in the open.
Why you looking around so much?
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here?
Hardly.
Perhaps it was. I was in boarding school for so many years, it's hard to remember. Do you have the tape of the latest exploits from my favorite hobby ?
What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?
Aren't you going to switch exits on him again ?
There's water in your bathroom.
What's that?
What's this? December 8th, 1958?
Harry, I really think she.....
You can come to my house for dinner?
Long trip.  Pretty nice of you to come.
I give.
You can't be serious?
Thanks.
Come on, Pop.
Well, if it ain't Duff!
You're late.
These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
Oh my God.  And they got a photo of you dressed like that?
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
Yeah.  Well, was the least I could do.
I I'd like to, Edie, but  there's nothin' I can do. Edie feels subdued, ashamed at breaking down. She rises, and in a low voice says
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
I'll say one thing for Jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much. He was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what I mean.
"Fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying."  Seems this woman's live-in boyfriend, seventy years old, complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelve-gauge.  Police found noodles in the woman's hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him.  They'd been together ten years.
It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?
Ironic, isn't it?
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation.
Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful?
What will they be made of?
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
It's him...Landon.
Listen-
You been smoking too much shit babe. Gotta control that. Takes a man down... I remember when you first come out to the bush, you was straight as a...
It might be worth a Martini to you.
You'll be safe here.  I won't be long.  Help yourself to anything you want. The galley's through there.  You can make coffee if you like.
If you're doing all this just for me.
Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?
Bluff. You've waited too long.
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.
Angelo, pay attention.  There's gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is showing traces of toxins.  PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
What do you want?
Those are cold.
We've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. Nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'.
If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?
At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
You are wonderful!
Here?
No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle...
You can't go up there.
Stuffy in here.  Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with "Bates' Motel" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there.... 
Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off... it'll make the girl feel better, Albert.
Take me down there.
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
What was her name?
You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I.  You'll have to admit she had four husbands.
Rose, you're very sick. You're burning up. Rose, can you hear me? Rose?
Happy Independence Day.
You tricked me.  I wouldn't have - I've never - never.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime. That ain't no crime.
Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh?
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
It's the right thing to do.
How long is it going to take?!
What do you think about all this?
Nothing.  Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went?
But nowhere near three million dollars worth.  I would say maybe twenty thousand.
That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.
Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong?
No.  It was my singing.
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
Let's go.
What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
You talk very fast.
What are you doing here?
Last night's as much my fault as yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --
You got a lot of guts calling me.
I love his eyes.  I just believe they're listening to you.
It's fun!  It's high.
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad.
But you don't pull a strike when the bosses want it -- so they can smash your union. You wait till you're ready, so you can win.
What's on the other end of this thing?
We left them eighty-eights.
Scans the Germans with his binoculars.
Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
Honey, it's not what you think.
Hello.
PAIN!
Give me my firebird keys!
There's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines.  I don't think that's a good idea.
Youre the one who got away.
Sidney. Hello. How are you?
You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
No.
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
For about two seconds.
Well... what the fuck, man?
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
I beg your pardon?
What I heard back there was that a band o' hostile Nawyeckas came through this way less'n two weeks ago...
Damn, this thing is heavy. Where do you want to have it?
Oh but why "alas?"
I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win.
It makes us feel a whole lot better.
-- yes.
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
Red Rum.
Really catching on.
I can't see anything in here!
Keep still, Constable.  You were half-drowned when they found you.
Thank you.
It appears well.  It has already clotted.
You like that Vaughan?
She's talkin' about me, Karl. That's my first name.
Yes sir.
Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook.
Not an easy book.
His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.
They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery.
Yes, indeed.  It's cost my family quite a bit of money.
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macram.
Yes.
Did your mother know you were going to see your father?
Yes... And in doing so, you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming.
Lane's closed big fellah, league night.
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
What <u>about</u> a crowbar?
He translated it wrong.
Riordan?
Did you?
Isn't it great to be in love ?
Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach !
A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?
Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.
It's Marty on the Coast -
Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
This'll work, huh?
You touched it.
I've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie.  And I'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar...
I grew up, a little.  I'm ready for a life that's built around commitm...
Nice to have you here.
Ni...
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.
Well, Mister President.
Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
Right.
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should.
So? What's L.A. like?
You sure have.
But the Power Source, Zaltar.
I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
Lots of things...
I'll do more than tell you. I'll show you, back at my place. If you'll just do me one little favor first.
Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
"They?"
-- as the keeper of the archives of Krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.
Perhaps there is some good in you after all, Lex Luthor.
Put down Lex Luthor !
Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?
No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.
I mean, the way they look.  Their hair and clothing...
Went over to Philly yesterday an' seen the folks...it's nice you send them the fifty a month...
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!
have no idea what ordinary people thought.
You were in insurance before the war.
Alright, the beige one.
I've heard good things about their London branch.  You have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
Do you know what to do?
I don't know.  A lot.
It's a profound life experience.
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?
You're not telling us something.
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
David?
I like the colors.
I should really give him a call.  He's a character, isn't he.  Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world.
Should I... should I tell you why?
We've met.  The Hacksaw Murders.  '89.
Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?
For once I'm glad you're rumor central.  What in the world is going on?
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping. What is this?
Marlon--
I know.
About time they started cleaning up the trash Downtown.  We don't want to end up like the rest of the country.
Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...
Well, yes. I suppose that is what I meant to say.
My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.
I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldnt have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.
Id appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you cant, dont worry about it. Ill call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but Im in a hurry. 
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
Stand by with the battering-rams...
Jeanne... The men are exhausted!
You think you are ready now?
I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.
T-w~e-l-v~e.
Lonnegan after you, too?
Well, what'd you think?
Shut up.
You don't say --
I'd like to see you work.
Which way do we go!?
I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl, is she Irish?
Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
Pardon me, m'sieu. Madame Colet would like to see you in the living room.
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
I'm sorry.
Yes?
He's all right.
Well I guess you can see, never a Dull moment.  Maybe you should Stay around to see what happens Next.  Who know?  You might find a Future here.
Fair enough.  You know I got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this.
Satisfied?
I'm a man without fear, Wyatt.  I Literally don't care if I live or Die.  But even I can't fight human Instinct.  Somebody suddenly Starts shooting at me, I duck. But you... what on earth were You thinking about?
Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'?
I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...
ROOAAAARR!!!
Would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while?
Running time?
Cut it out.
No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.
A walk.
What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
Sherman, set the Wayback Machine for...oh, 1973. Kevin Flynn  is one of the brightest young software engineers at ICOM. He's so bright that he starts going in there at night, and sets up a private memory file, and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing, called...  ...Space Paranoids.
I want to go to his place.
Yes?
Helen!  It's your mystery man.
Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to "Doctor Zhivago" are in arbitration?
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?
You're afraid of germs?
We need gas.
No.
I'm curious about something.  I'm wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom's at.
Toby!  Toby Tyler, leave him alone!
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
Got any requests?
Keep your change.  Bus three-twenty-three. Leaves at seven fifty two, tonight.
I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color.
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
How are you, Keaton?
Heartwarming. Really, I feel weepy.
Mr. Concannon...?
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
They might.  Yes.  That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe.  They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe.  I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.   I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve.  And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham.  There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...'
Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
Where's your husband?
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
She died.
We have to call the ambulance.
"Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me.
Come down here, you scamp.
They're varicose veins, miss, but some days I can't take care of them.
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
What about him?
We're due at Andrews. 
No, I'm fine... I got it together....
Uh...uh... Mounties.  The Mounties Guard The Border. uh... those Mountie Hats.
It's tough to rhyme.
I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?
Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud!
It's too rough.
Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?
It's not some fairytale in an old book.    Michael - look at me.  I didn't choose this, Michael.  This is who I am.  I love you.
This must be one of the old keys -
No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
Well? What do you think of her?
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
There's nothing for them to get.
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!
I could be you rguard!  I could carry your spear!
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
Aunt Em!
...Tin Man!
How long has he been with you?
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
Im not.
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey.  Three words: Are mutants dangerous?
What is it you intend to do to me?
I didn't do that.
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
