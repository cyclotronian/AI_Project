Did you change your hair?
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
I say, do what you wanna do.
So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
I'm sorry..
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
It's not?
Excellent.
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
What?
You stayed away?
The rest of the secret service?
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
I hope you can understand how special your world is... how unique a people you humans are.  So it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves.
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
Father -
So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
I've left those pills for you.
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
Go on, ask them.
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
Longer.
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!
Don't turn around.
"The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!"  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?
Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in...  Just joking...  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it.  Sorry about that.
This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.
I heard what happened.
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
What's this?
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. 
I'm starvin' like Marvin.
And?
You want my heart?
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
What happened to "degrees"?
I didn't mean that as a compliment.
No.
Hardy, what are you doing --
Well, she... uh...
The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand.
Good. Now I got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. R.L. and Lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. What do you know how to make?
Getting very weird.
You must leave?
Look, you need Ich.  I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs.
Money?
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
You wanted to see me!
This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?
Say what?!
Frank. Come in.
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
There's another stocker, right?
Give him a second.
Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
Now, my flower, do you understand?
Come, it'll help you sleep.
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
Please.
My bill.
How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.
Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.
Merry Christmas eve.
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
*Liver* killed him?
Did you know your mother better?
Can --
That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this!
How much?
Meet me at my place later.
'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend?  Who would take offense to that?
What a creep.
So this guy walks into a bar and says...
This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.
And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.
Kitty, I would appreciate... if you could wait...
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
We mustn't let him land!
Let's talk about it later.
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
They thought it said, "Liberatis me," "Save me," but it's not "me." It's "tutemet:" "Save yourself."
Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.
Do we have enough time for a weld?
Hey...
What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
We just missed the turnoff to the party.
I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end.
Why?
No, she's looking for you.
Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it.
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
Yes...?
Victor!
Died instantly?
Far out.  Where are my glasses?
I'll try anyway, sir.
Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Where the hell is he?  An hour and a half late.  An hour and a half!
I don't laugh at you, George.  I like you.  I like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings.
If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.
How about this?
You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?
I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...
Who was that?
Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
"Get her?"  That was your whole plan?  You call that science?
It's disgusting!  Animals!  I had to come here under armed guard.  Slaves -- get this junk out of my sight.
Aren't you eating?
Please let me go.
Can I talk to you a minute?
Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.
So that's how we stand, Baron.
Telegrams?
Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.
You're a very unusual stenographer --
What?
What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind?  ...Or is that the time?
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.
Where's the baby?!
What do you do for a living?
I'm sorry.
'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.
Why do you say that?
You're talking about real excitement?
Julia!
Don't look at me.
I've been better.
You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.
...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
Great.  Can I have it then?
Don't worry about it, Dick.  Barry's an asshole.
Do you want me to be there?
You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.
I haven't any hard feelings.
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
Well -- what is it?
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
Who locked the door?
Hey!
Any news?
Earl, you must never do that again.
The next one is ours. Either it hits us or it goes past us.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
Keep the change and get yourself a new name.
We'll need pictures of the inside too.
I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.
Yeah. My brother told me.
What SPF, sweetie?
Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female.
Pittsburgh?
Don't you ever cook anything?
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
I have a confession to make. I'm not real big on flying.
Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
It is you Junior!
What did you get?
Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
I can't!
I'll tell you what to say.
JOE What abilities...?
What did you tell them?
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
Lowell, I can't afford --
Poor communication skills.
I'll have the tournedos of beef. And the lady will have the same?  I assume you're a carnivore.
All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?
Oh. And that is -- mom?
No.
You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'mI'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questionsI  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
What about that diamond wrist watch she had onshe can raise some money on that?
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that busI told them to wait!
Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.
Yeah?
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
Remember that.
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .
Did you like it?
Leave him behind!
Larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. But they got him!
If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him.
No.
Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!
You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
Yo, you think we killed that guy?
I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative.
What's this?
I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
The spiral begins in the west.
A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
And if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. Which would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. Isn't that right?
You almost had me fooled.
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
So, I hear the tart from California shot Heyworth.
You're magnificent.
What was that?  Did you hear that?
Well done, lad.  Stout heart.
Pinching?  Where?
Where is it?
A night in the hole?
You're soft.
What are you in for, Willie?
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
Did you check out the dragon mouth?
All right. Now you keep your bargain.
Not even a radio?
The police?
Yes. I'm afraid it does.
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
That money is your per diem.
I can't make out that shit.
Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.
Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
Stomach's gone. But... okay.
[I know this. Your point?]
He's not a cop killer.
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
Planes mostly. May take a crack at rickshaws. How does the direct approach work over here?
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything.
Yeah?
What?
He had access to the keys --
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
Here you go!  No pushing!
"Basically".
You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you!
He seemed quite taken with you.
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
You can't find it in racing forms, Chick.
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
But they did take place?
Oh, thank you!
Hello, Mary?
It's merely a suggestion. I don't wish to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything. It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something.
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
I've got one for Cobb
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely?
At least you pulled yourself out...
I can't believe the price of these fleabags.
You know I'm writing a play -- it's just a little Broadway thing, but there's a part in it that I think you'd be perfect for.
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
Were you in love with any of them?
Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.
Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.
Well, let me in.
Wait.
Pearl! You ain't --
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
Now: Where?
You believe in the Boogey Man?
That's two weeks from Thursday...
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
We can't touch Hoover --
Like you said Jack, I'm just a New York lawyer now.
Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.
Do you know who I am?
We should go.
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!
Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit.
Fuck.
I know that.
Lord Cornwallis is brilliant.  His weakness is that he knows it.
The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
If I had known --
You can't do this!  You owe me, O'Brien.  I made you plastic!  I made you!
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
Uh oh.  I remember that temper.
Look, I quit!
Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again.
How far have you gotten?
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  If you need anything, I'll be right over there.
David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.
No.
Come on, I thought we had fun, rich boy --
I'll say whatever I want --
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
Thank you for your time
Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk like that. She's still my wife.
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
Vickie, open up. I need to come in.
Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.
Hello.
Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
What do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a match?  I'm going to break my neck in here.  Where are you?
Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
Got something to say to me, Nick?
Not these guys.
And this is Helen Carter.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
Okay, I get the point.
Yo' Tommy, what up, man?
But I'm not joking.
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules.  When did you say you wanted them?
This is just... so...
Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes would have laid on you, Rog, but it's all I got, and...  ...all I got I share with you. Go ahead. Take all you want.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!
You talked to Wendy?
You came all the way out here to tell me you're going to California? All you had to do was go, and we'd never see each other again.
You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
Hello, Rae.
What makes you think I could?
-- I've been here before! -- On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
That's not true -- Where are you--?
An existentialist.
What happened?
And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
So, this could be your last night, huh?
What do you think?  Any chance?  There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this.
I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
Some prep school thing.
-- but at least Aunt May's okay now. I really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.
Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
To the Brick Kremlin!
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise --
My Lord... what are your orders?
Saavik, get us out, best speed!
Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
Iowa.
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...
Can he breathe under water?
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
Suppose when they returned they threw the boots into the garbage?
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
What are you saying?
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
Who knows.
You live in such a fantasy world...
I'm so sorry, man. You were so right. I got rid of the gun
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
Things went badly in Palermo?
You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.
Are you okay?
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
Yeah.
When did you start smoking?
They couldn't wait to see you.
Luke... what time is it?
Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is.  "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters.  Now, did you go to any meetings?
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
Mitch, let's turn back.
How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
Oh, you'll have ample opportunity -- ample --  Good morning, Dr. Fettes.
Good afternoon.  I'm glad to see you up and around.
That's right.
What you doin'?
Goes on like that quite awhile.  What do you gentlemen make of it?
Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
Hey, Mister, you need a ride?
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
I... I don't know.  I don't know what you're askin' me.
I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.
Well why don't you look her up?
Mary.
You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
You bet.
I thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts. We did an honorin' song for him and everything.
I thought he'd never leave.
No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
Catch it later, Pham.  Gotta get over to Nestor's.
Isn't it a standard trick to pack a line-up with men who resemble each other but look different than the suspect, so the suspect will stand out for the eyewitnesses?
That would indicate that it's the future.
Even this heavy work beats being at home with the old ball and chain.
But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
Really, Marietta, you got more scenarios swimmin' around in your brain than Carter got pills. Try to take it easy. Go over to Myrtle Beach for a few days.
What brand'd she smoke?
Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that?
Wouldn't make any difference.
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
Is that in my chart?
Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle.  Have one.
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
I'm kidding. Hello?
What's her name?
Look, you can go now.
Lord Almighty.
No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
How do you manage to put up with all this confusion? You always said people bore you.
I'm being punished.
God!  It was God.  And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him.
Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
Ringo!
You're a window rattler, son.
Dell, I want greater magnification. More surface detail.  I want to see what this place looks like.
It's really on there tight.
<u>How</u>?
My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!
What is it?
What the hell are you doing?
She's quite a girl, that what's-her name...
Addison-!
It's after one now. You won't get home till all hours.
Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
I guess it started back home. Wisconsin, that is. There was just mum, and dad - and me. I was the only child, and I made believe a lot when I was a kid - I acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. But somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more, it got so that I couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me... I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I?
Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
Right.
Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old.
Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.
Oh shit! No! Andy, don't let them take me back there!
Noooo....
Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
Two minutes, Alvy.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
Oh, yeah?
That's the key question.
I tell you this because, as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving... on the road at night... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion.  The sound of shattering glass. The... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.
Stop calling me Max.
Are you my big hard hero?
We closed.
What are you saying?
Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I don't understand you.  And I don't think I ever understood Lucy.  I don't understand throwing it away.  How do you throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I want the possibilities.  And all kinds of crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  All the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it.  We'd have had amazing children, you and me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have surprised yourself.  I'll never love anybody else, you know.
Yes I did.
Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to help me find the dog!  I let their dog out.  We need to find the dog.
Oh my god.  I've been so rude.  I'm Skye Davidson.  Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers?
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
You're a shit.
Water...water...
We're going to die!
Good night.
You know, I felt so lousy this morning -- a hundred and one fever -- then my promotion came up -- now you and I -- eleventh row center -- and you said I should have stayed in bed.
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
Why they call you that?
I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want.
...I won't let a killer walk!
I'm not gonna carry you out of here.
What the heck are those for?
Not too good at small talk, eh?
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
Why?
Damn!
You will wish you hadn't.
No, just a drill.
I don't want to go.
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
By the way, that reminds me...  Saturday night we're taking Grandma Stella out for Chinese food.
Hi.
You're a welcome sight...
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had one of those days?
Sure, Charlie.
The boat blew.  There was a leak in the gas line.  There were two previous repairs.  There was a five-mil policy on both of 'em.  A real heavy investigation.  Zilch. Goose-egg.  It was an accident.
Bruno called. In Europe, people are saying you're gonna die from drugs. They think they can cash in on your death.
Don't you think he's using you?
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
No beauty...
I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.
How about, MR. E.
You SCUM!  You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
Are they paying you for all this?
You know, Mr. Bean's okay.  You're not gonna kick him out, are you, Dad?
Otho'll know what to do.
Oh, I like that very much.
You must sit with us, my friend, we have much to discuss.
I was, wasn't I?  I was John fucking Malkovich!  Take me back, Craig.
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it?
What you want?
I ain't sure I know that. Baby never laid eyes on her till she showed up here. And how'd she make it and her husband didn't? And where is he? And how she have that baby in the woods by herself? Said a whitewoman help her. Shoot. You believe that? Well, I know what kind of white that was.
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
From who?
--now c'mon!
Beer and weed is what I've got.
--and none of 'em were mine! I-am-so-fucked, I-am-so-fucked-- where the hell was everybody???
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
See you Tuesday, Frank.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?
Can I give you a kiss good night?
Okay.
He comes over to study.
Jesus Christ.
Bah, for that matter, Algeria isn't the only country in the world ...
Humped
I don't know.
Do you ever regret not having a family?
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
Where is it?
Forget it.
When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down.
What?
What if it doesn't come back?
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
I mean it fixed itself.
I got some forms here to fill out about that accident when you get the time.  I'll fire you tomorrow. I promise.
She wanted something to help her sleep.
That's how it's done. You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
Okay.  I think I'd better be alone for a while.
Do you want him all the way to the car?
Is it murdered man?
May I please have another little kiss?
You were supposed to be here at three.
Oh.  Sorry.
Well, I'm done.  Are you done?
The homelesses?
A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--
Party without me.
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
Yeah.
Now, what does she have to do with all this?
Yeah, uh, who's this?
Legally, she can't take that stuff. Legally, she can't take the stuff.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
How serious?
Yeah, that works out.
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
You fucked with me for the last time!
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
Will you two cut it out?
You're not Lenore Oberfeld.
You old-fashioned?
What was that all about?
Why?
Leave her out of this.
Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
Yes, I know.
Reggie -- open the door.
Shut up.
They'll meet you at the top.
It's not over, Brynner.
 Talk to me.
How do you do that?
Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.
Elena!...But when...
Let him finish, Charles.
That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
With this guy locked in?
This is the last time I come to this place.
No.
I didn't think they even enforced this.
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
I don't think your manager would appreciate...
Get with it.  Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us.  Lost in space.  The universe doesn't care.  The cop, you, me?  Who notices?
You going to warn him?
Was that who I thought it was?
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
Belief is immaterial.  What's important is the truth... It's been my job to find Jerry.  I'm very much responsible for him.
I want you to listen to me, carefully.  The minute the implications of this message became clear, this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one -- an extremely complex, extremely volatile one. There are forces at work here you don't understand; I can help you up to a point, but only up to a point.
You was eyeballin', Luke. You can't gitcha mind on them weeds if yer eyeballin'...
Whoee, it's cold. Wisht I had somethin' to eat. Bread, grits, beans even. Soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then I'm gonna show you some farm girls that...
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
I'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. If you want me to pick you up, I will.
I don't know why you feel you have to lie, Letty.
No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.
Especially now.
All right, knock it off.
So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
Please.
Take my horse and go to the compound. Give this to Mrs. Wu.  She'll help you.  Hurry!
What do you want?
I'm... I'm alright.
I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
What was that?
Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy shit.
What do you want?
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
You?
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
No, I have a cat.
Very good, Mr._?
And don't limit poetry to the word. Poetry can be found in a work of art, music, a photograph, in the way a meal is prepared--anything with the stuff of revelation in it.  It can exist in the most everyday things but it must never, never be ordinary  By all means, write about the sky or a girl's smile but when you do, let your poetry conjure up salvation day, doomsday, any day, I don't care, as long as it enlightens us, thrills us and--if it's inspired--makes us feel a bit immortal.
You know me, always taking on too much.
I have to go home, Sanchez.
You okay?
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come.
Jabez -- Jabez!
If you're right I'm gonna back you a hundred percent, you know that.
No.  Look, we're kind of....
You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?
What?
Cool it, Choco.
Something is going down. Something bad.
Nice!
That's what you think?
I should have Vito go with you all the time.
You're it.
Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?
Well, I'm listening now.
I got the early edition!  It was just dropped off at the newsstand.
Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
You know what would be great?
Sure.
How's Marcia? She all right?
What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
You wanted to meet here?
You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?
They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
What did you say?
Oh - I've found plums.  We have plums in the orchard.  We have an orchard! She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.
What's happening?  Am I needed?
Meaning--
It's a fake.
Hang on.
It's too soon.
Which number do you want, George?
He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else.  I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head.
They're my friends.
Plissken...?
Merlin, help me. I need your help. I don't know how--
She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.
Frankie.
Count it.
So?
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
Almost married.  And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
Rise...and...shine...!
About four grand.  And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D.  Im putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
Kate...
I found it!
You said there was a quick way out!
lot. It's a limited -
Bob was a grown man.  In any great struggle, there will be casualties. Wouldn't that be implicit in the name?  Project "Mayhem."
I do?
Where -- ?
Him...?
Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?
Mrs. Stanwyk!
You wish.
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
You don't use shit?
You give him his drops?
Now you listen to me.  My name is John Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st, where I've lived my whole life.  And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father...
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
I just realized something. Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him for hours.
Diana -- you heard from Jessica lately?
You have no right...
Did you find Rennie?
So, are you having fun yet?
I've got the numbers.
It's okay...you're going to be okay.
Where the hell are you?
"...what shape it will take." Jinnah has -- what?
We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.
Call German.
He has the heart of an ox.  He could run through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run. Actually, he was a big college swimming star.
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric.
What about the other two?
I will close.  John, John, ten percent.  I can get hot.  You know that...
Is that what you're saying?
The check's no good?
John: John:...my daughter...
Rick...
Ready, Frankie.
They're still on the property. Maybe you better stay inside.
I accept your generosity...
Thanks, doll.
To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
Did you kill anyone?
Go home, Clay.  We're closing up.
A boost. A big boost ...
You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?
I know...
On account of Mitch?
I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ?
Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?
About thirty million to one.
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
Yes, sir.
...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure.
Wait a minute--
I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.
What did you say?
I'm sorry... about what I said. It's just that -- all those times you and Daddy were trying for another kid, I... I used to pray at night that it would work. And not because of you guys or that I wanted a brother or sister... but... just so I wouldn't have to be...
Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?
Crash Override.
You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up.
But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us.
Ohh?
Boy...Holly...Holly.
Waal...
"Because we don't have any money."
I want the money.
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
Yes.
Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?
My God!  It... it <u>is</u> him!
How was your lunch with Charlie?
Oh God.
Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. I've had it.
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
What do you want?
He didn't say.
You are the manager?
What do you want?
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
Keep talking!
... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is.
Oh, you read that.
Talking to me, dad?
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but --
You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly.
What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?
You promise to care for her then?
I know I don't want to stay in here.
Can't talk right now.
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
What's that?
Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it.
No . . . No . . . No. . .
Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't.
Zuzu! What's the matter with Zuzu?
Did you say Cable Junction?
Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm gonna go!
You set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen.
No fair, I'm not armed.
Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry....
In a minute....
I know how to tag a damn conch....
Shit....
You can drive down there, Sir ..
Alright, we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know. Take notes if you want to.
What did you say?
We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  And very well-funded.
You four are going to have a little company out in the park.  Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.
What is it?
Ted, what are you talking about?!
No.
We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.
It really is beautiful, isn't it?
Who taught you be be a nurse?
You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?
Hank?
No way...
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!
It hit me!  Where are they?!
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?
Mikey--
When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.
Bad show last night?
Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?
Quiet.  Real quiet...
Sorry about your game.
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
I'm Bob.
Phone number.
I am preparing for a ball!
What the hell happened?
Do you see?
Yes?
What's the problem, Molly?
Lt. Fisk said...
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
What's in Memphis?
How did you do that?
Well, he isn't.  Nice...real nice.
Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them?  Lock her up?
Wasn't a book...was a short story.
Don' be facety, woman.
Uh --
Joe, don't do this --
...It's not over, 'til it's over.
What a night.
I've got patients coming in --
Where's she now?
How'd they get onto you?
Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them?
It's there!
Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster.
The profanity bothers you?
Max made a deal with you?
May I presume to ask you a question?
There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.
Sorry ...
Good idea, O Lord!
No, no, this cannot be.   I am sworn to chastity!
Should we take it seriously?
"You're still here?"
Kojak here is arresting me for unpaid parking tickets.
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
What are you doing? You can't go in there!
He won't give it to me.
I like my name.
It doesn't work, it always stays black. 
I could go for a Coke.
Ya know, I was.
Don't, Duff.
Why'd you do it, Armitage?
He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.
Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?
You mean a shithead.
Mom and Dad?  That's...crazy.  They never said...
Bernie -- this is Anna.
Yeah, it'll satisfy me.
Go with him, Rose. Go with him.
Shhh. Wait a minute. You guys are gonna screw up my plans. So just gone on back to bed like nothin' happened.
What?...
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
ex-tanker who's walking on his heels ?
About Edie?
You love me then?
When!?
Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu.
Bandits at 2 o'clock.
Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker.  I'm Rafe McCawley's best friend.
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
One more thing, Your Honor...
Julius!
... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it.
<u>Fuck me</u>. You said "clear."
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
It goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete Englishman.
You're so famous now.
Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
No, but it's getting there.
I'm sorry.
I know.  I'm glad.
Goddamit!  Where is he getting the money to fight?
Why do you want to know?
I asked him what was so important for him. "True love," he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are.
Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.
Inigo.
They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
It's been three.
I won't feel satisfied unless I got out there, Sam.
You are too gracious. These things have some merit, I suspect ... but this--  ... I am convinced, is fine. 
See that, son? Now this is a heel, see, and there, that's the ball of a foot. Someone has been walking here.
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
I'm sorry, darlin', I hate it as much as you do.
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
Good luck.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
I just dislocated my finger.
Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy.
Outta my house I want ya!!
Does this help?
A challenge, on my life.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
O sweet my mother cast me not away. Delay this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim  monument where Tybalt lies.
Shhh!
What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...
Whatever...
Did they ever find out who they were?
No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
Behind me is the soft count room.  We're pretty sure the plates are back there.
Help me Rhonda.
No, that's what makes you unemployed.
You could have told me you were fiance number three.
That's fair.
Don't horse me. Price of zinc's never been higher. They don't want no strike -- not with their war boom on.
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
It did?
You know what, you'd like her.
Have you checked the...
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
Tell that to Cotton Weary. You wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.
They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
Can you see me right now?
You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect.
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.
This could be good. What do you think, Sid?
It's a bucket of vomit.
Did you read them?
Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
I wish I still thought like you.
Another little problem.
The show must  you know
Will!
You're a bad loser.
Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
What are you looking at?
I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.
It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...
I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.  I fear that is the only thing to do.
I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years.  What a marvelous program. Innovative.  Inspiring.  You are to be commended.
Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last night...
Then I guess you're stuck.  Life sentence.  No parole.
I am?
You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
My God... what has happened?
How 'bout you, Jerry.
Do you like to play football?
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
Still, you can't just write her off.
Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.
It's the way it happened, I know it is.
Cut it out, girls.  Stop it. Joe - Josephine - help!
Where are we running, Joe?
Did he get fresh?
Its the past. Its nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then lets go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.
Come on, you guys... We have to THINK!
Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
What is happening around here!!!
Sir, if the subs haven't left by now...
Parasolutrine?
How do you feel about him now ?
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
Evening, Annie.
Start?  This isn't a good time.
I'm looking for the writer.
Grace, get on the other phone, call that girl: well, call her, and have whatsername send up some <u>nosh</u>...what do you like to drink...?
I don't got the money.
Where the hell have you been...?  It's...
But I couldn't r'member all the words. Ast them would they gimme a second chance.
You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!
She's devastated.
We make our lives, one step at a time.  We do the best we can.  The truth about the future?  A promise. Is only a hope.
You're not.
Well?
I don't think that's a fair analogy, sir.
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
Hello?
From Artie.  What's wrong?
You're a writer, you said.
Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
You're late. Very late.
I've never been in a place like this before.
Ahhhh, my favorite part of the day. Who else could have thought of this aquarium?
Where's mine?! Where's my parachute?
He knows that?  Billy?
Do you have the blood test?
That's a lollipop that, boy.  The kid is only great.
I know Steve.  No.
What are you so chipper about?  If I put a cross on every one of your mistakes, you'd look like a graveyard!
J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.
So, what does the Russki want?
Dinner's in the oven.
Pleasure to meet you, I'd like to see my brother, thank you.
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
... No, I went in for more improving pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses.
I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo.
But first I gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking.
You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?
Dr. Frock.  Did you hear that?
I'm coming with you.
But why didn't he just follow her to Fiji?
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
What?
On whose orders?
You're sure?  Any more nightmares?
Harry...
How did you get the fucking number?
Don't tell me what I --
What part of Germany are you people from?
From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times...
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
It may sound like music to her -- I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower.  Click  click  click.
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. Ill give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
You go to Heller, did I ask you to talk to him?
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
You don't want to learn.
Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
Sounds like a good case.  Girl mysteriously murdered.  No one knows who did it.  They haven't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --
Is that true?
What happened?
I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?
He says it's a box.
It's all right now, shhhh it's all right.
Well?
....with me?  What am I to her or she to me?  Nothing.  She's an ordinary roommate.  I..I share...
The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.
Good, now the other side.
So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch.
Like it?
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
Madame Colet, I think you deserve a scolding. First, you lose your bag--
It's disgraceful!
Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?
An accident?!
Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
Come on, you...
Not me.  I'm in my prime.
Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour.  For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago -
Is this - like - a normal day for you?
Oh no you can't. Get on with the painting.
Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in the family connection business: real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries. He met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things: entering society and using his fishing boats.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two.
Dana, Mr. Hardy called.  Why weren't you in class today?
Hi, honey.  How was the flight?
Go to the liquor store -  Where is there a liquor store around here?
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
Where's the fire sweetheart? Don't know how they work things in Nevada, but we got speed limits in this state.
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
You forgot the "Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on" step. See usually that comes before the, "It's over" Step. And it always, always comes before the "You can go" Step.  What is over?
He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.
William Munny, yeah.
How many men you killed?  Ain't you gonna answer?
We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  Isn't that what you did?
Uh ... in the, well, in the interests of her family ... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution.  Her doctors ...
Dr. Gruber.
So what?
Dr. Towler...
It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
Boyd...I don't know man...It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins self-help thing...you're all fucked-up in the head.
That's a good one.
You all right?
What does that mean?
<u>Fuck</u> the world.  Try a ten A.M. <u>pitch</u> meeting, no sleep, coked-to-the-gills, and you haven't even read the <u>material</u>.
Where is he now?
Uh...uh... Mounties.  The Mounties Guard The Border. uh... those Mountie Hats.
So what's the problem?
You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the "sir" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline...
Would you like some iced tea?
Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
How long have you been watching me?
Check this out.  Hurry!
Ted, we put a lot of love in our business.
You're amazing.
Well? Surprised?
We're a tiny version of all that?
I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!
I just wanted to test it first.
If she?
I haven't slept in weeks.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
I dont want to be safe!
His what?
Yorgi and Kirill.
What are you talking about?
But look at what's been done with hearts and kidneys!
