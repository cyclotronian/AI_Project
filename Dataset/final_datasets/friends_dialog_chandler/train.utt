i mean hey !  i just met you ,  i don &apos;t know you from adam .   .  .  . only child ,  right ?  parents divorced before you hit puberty .  
i know ,  i mean ,  why can &apos;t parents just stay parents ?   why do they have to become people ?  why do they have .  .  .   why can &apos;t you stop staring at my breasts ?  
alright ,  alright .  we &apos;re all adults here ,  there &apos;s only one way to resolve this .  since you saw her boobies ,  i think ,  uh ,  you &apos;re gonna have to show her your peepee .

now ,  y &apos;see ,  most people ,  when their pets pass on ,  they want  &apos;em sorta laid out like they &apos;re sleeping .  but occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose .  like ,  chasing their tail ,   or ,  uh ,  jumping to catch a frisbee .

y &apos;know what i mean ,  about how i &apos;m always going out with all these women .  and i always figured ,  when the right one comes along ,  i &apos;d be able to be a stand - up guy and go the distance ,  y &apos;know ?  now i &apos;m looking at my dad ,  thinking .  .  .

well ,  we &apos;re applying to a lot of them .  naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos ,  y &apos;know ,  like ,  uh ,  san diego .  .  .  right ?  but that might just be a pipe dream ,  because ,  y &apos;know ,  he &apos;s out of state .  uh ,  my vet ,  uh ,  knows someone at miami ,  so that &apos;s a possibility .  
hey .  we found her ,  we found the girl .

okay ,  you hide my clothes .  i &apos;m gonna do the exact opposite to you .  
hey ,  opposite ,  is opposite !   
rachel ,  didn &apos;t have anything that i liked ,  so ,  but she had this christmas ribbon ,  and i thought ,   &apos;all right ,  fine i &apos;ll be political .  &apos; 
it was ,  it was her voice .  
 uh ,  michelle .  yeah ,  that was me ,  i - i dialed your number by mistake .   oh ,  you &apos;re so sweet .  yeah ,  we were a great couple .  i know i really miss him .  well ,  you know how it is ,  it &apos;s that .  .  .  .  
okay ,  fine .

okay ,  buddy - boy .  here it is .  you hide my clothes ,  i &apos;m wearing everything you own .  
look at me !  i &apos;m chandler !  could i be wearing any more clothes ?  maybe if i wasn &apos;t going commando .  .  .  
okay ,  okay .  enough ,  enough with the lunging .  no !  i &apos;m sick of this .  okay .  i &apos;ve had it up to here with you two !  neither you can come to the party !  
 how  &apos;bout instead you ,  go get changed !   you ,  give him back his underwear !  i &apos;m gonna go get a cab ,  and i want everyone down stairs in two minutes !  monica !   
 well ,  i have to tell you ,  i was quite impressed with your paper on pre - cretaceous fossils .  yeah ,  it confirmed everything that i have written .  
yes ?  
what do you mean ,  your seat ?  
but ,  you got up !  
 whoaa !  !  
hey .  
nooo .  i had a story all worked out but then chandler sold me out .  
whoa ,  jam !  i love jam !   hey ,  how come we never have jam at our place ?  
hey .  
do i look fat ?  
okay ,  walk us through it ,  honey ,  walk us through it .  
and it works both ways .  
okay ,  for instance .  let &apos;s say ,  janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options .  option number 1 she &apos;ll take a cab home from the airport .  option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim .  which do you do ?  
 wrong !  now you &apos;re single .  it &apos;s actually secret option number three ,  you meet her at the gate .  that way she knows you love her .  
good luck chandler .  
 okay the sleeping thing .  very tricky business ,  but there is something you can do .  
noo !  no ,  not cuddlily ,  not me ,  just her .  i &apos;m like you ,  i need the room .  okay ,  come here .   okay ,  you &apos;re in bed .  .  .  
i &apos;m gonna use the cushion .  
okay ,  you &apos;re in bed .  she &apos;s over on your side ,  cuddling .  now you wait for her to drift off ,  and then you hug her  and roll her back over to her side of the bed .  and then you rollll a - way .  hug for her !  roll for you .  
yep .  
shoot .  
okay ,  first i &apos;m not crazy .  and second ,  say it don &apos;t spray it .  anyway his name is malcom ,  and he wasn &apos;t following me ,  i mean he was ,  but  &apos;cause he thought i was ursula ,  ick .  and ,  that &apos;s why ,  that &apos;s why he couldn &apos;t just come up and talk to me .   &apos;cause of the restraining order .  
aww .   ohh !  
i figured out i need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even .  so ,  i &apos;ve got a new plan now .  babies .  
it took me 28 years to find one man that i wanna spend my life with ,  if i have to wait another 28 years then ,  i &apos;ll be 56 before i can have a baby ,  and that &apos;s just stupid .  
night - night bing - a - ling .  
 okay ,  sperm donor number 03815 ,  come on down !  okay ,  he &apos;s 6 &apos;2 &quot;  ,  170 pounds ,  and he describes himself as a male geena davis .  
well ,  right after i did that sex study down at nyu .   hey ,  remember that sweater i gave you for your birthday ?  
what ,  he &apos;s not still following her .  do you think he is still following her ?  
 hey .   uh ,  chan ,  can i uh ,  can i talk to you for a second ?  
 are you intrigued ?  
hey .  
maybe you can tell me .  my agent would like to know why i didn &apos;t show up at the audition i didn &apos;t know i had today .  the first good thing she gets me in weeks .  how could you not give me the message ?  !  
  &apos;annie !  hi .  listen we got a problem with joey tribbiani ,  apparently he missed his audition .  who did you speak to in my office ?  estelle ,  no ,  i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m going to do with her .  no .  all right ,  so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment ,  the world does not stop .  &apos; 
  &apos;right ,  well look ,  um ,  if joey loses this audition ,  that is it for estelle .  i don &apos;t care !  annie you are a doll ,  what time can you see him ?  &apos;  i need a pen .   
i &apos;m sorry ,  it just felt nice .  
hey ,  i only got one good arm ,  you know .  you should be doing stuff for me .  go get me a sweater .  
what &apos;s the big deal ?  why don &apos;t you wanna see janice ?  
and that &apos;s bad because .  .  .  ,  you hate chicken piccata ?  
you didn &apos;t want to share your tomatoes ,  tomatoes are very important to you .  
what is it with you people !  i mean ,  the minute you start to feel something ,  you have to run away ?  
hey ,  you know about that ?  !  
 where there is no fear of commitment .  
amazingly ,  that makes sense .  
oh ,  yeah .  go for it man ,  jump off the high dive ,  stare down the barrel of the gun ,  pee into the wind !  
so ,  how come you wanted to eat in tonight ?  
ohhh ,  are you a puppy !   contact paper !  i never really know what to say when someone you &apos;re sleeping with gives you contact paper .  
oh ,  you didn &apos;t have to do this .  
well ,  i gotta buy a vowel .  because ,  oh my gawd !  who ,  would &apos;ve thought that someday ,  chandler bing would buy me a drawer .  
we should ?  
 i don &apos;t think we need to ,  because you &apos;re tripping me out right now !  are you okay ?  
you probably want us to move in together ?  
yeah ,  well ,  it scares me !  i mean i not even divorced yet ,  chandler .  you know ,  you just invited me over here for pasta ,  and all of the sudden you &apos;re talking about moving in together .  and ,  and i wasn &apos;t even that hungry .  you know what ,  it &apos;s getting a little late ,  and i - i should just ,  um .  .  .  
honey ,  this will help .   
that is never good .  
okay ,  wait a minute ,  wait a minute ,  wait a minute .  maybe it &apos;s not so bad .  how did you leave it ?  
she said she &apos;d call me .  
welcome to our side of the tunnel .  
yeah ,  you do .  
well ,  no ,  not at all ,  you &apos;re not terminal ,  you just ,  you just need some damage control .  
right .  so ,  what you have to do is ,  you have to accidentally run into her on purpose .  and then act aloof .  
oooh ,  honey ,  you &apos;re not a total loser .  
 no ,  thank you .   chandler !

who &apos;s party is it ?  
what woman ?  !  
okay ,  you know ,  one of two things is happening here .  either you &apos;re seeing somebody behind my back ,  which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet .  or ,  else you &apos;re pretending that you &apos;re seeing somebody ,  which just makes you so pathetic that i could start crying right here in the cereal aisle .  so like which of these two guys do you want to be ?

yeah !  you don &apos;t like kathy .  
yeah ,  you &apos;ve been avoiding her ever since we started going out .  look ,  i made an effort to like janice ,  now i think it &apos;s your turn to make an effort to like kathy by going out to dinner with us .  right ?  
good ,  and hey !  my treat .   but that &apos;s only because you &apos;re not eating anything ,  right ?

not your type ?  !  she &apos;s gorgeous !  
okay .  understanding a little more why you &apos;re single .  ohh !  y &apos;know ,  i have a friend you would like ,  she &apos;s really pretty .  and then we could double date !  
okay ,  i &apos;ve got some ugly friends ,  and they &apos;re all available too .  
 i &apos;ll be right back .   what was that ?  
kathy was being really nice and you just walked away .  i thought we had a deal .  
i want you to like her !  but if that &apos;s too damned difficult for you ,  then the least you can do is pretend .  
well then ,  do it better !  
hey what are you guys looking at ?  
probably the only time i &apos;ll ever say this ,  but did you see the ass on her ?  
actually she &apos;s a paleontology doctoral candidate ,  specializing in the centazoic era .  
oo !  is it for my birthday present ?  
yeah ,  but remember you said you ordered something special ,  and it just hasn &apos;t come yet ?  
 &apos;kay .  
oh ,  the velveteen rabbit !  oh my god ,  when the boy &apos;s love makes the rabbit real !  
huh .  well ,  then you &apos;d better keep it away from ross &apos;s hair .  so this is pretty rare .  how did you get that ?  
yeah ,  and what a great way to say ,   &quot; i secretly love you ,  roommate &apos;s girlfriend !  &quot;

why not ?  
sure it is !  she needs a pen for work ,  she &apos;s writing ,  she turns it over .  .  .  .   &quot; whoa !  it &apos;s time for my date with joey !  &quot;  
she didn &apos;t have a birthday while we were going out .

thanks ,  man .  and oh ,  while you &apos;re at it ,  could you get her a card ?  
any luck ?  
all right ,  look .  why don &apos;t you just return the book ,  let joey give her the clock pen ,  and you give her something worse than that .  like .  .  .  a regular pen .

yeah !  joey has the best boyfriend ever !  
does joey know ?  
no the - the sad thing is ,  if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her ,  knowing joey ,  he probably just wouldve just stepped aside .  
he loves you .  
i remember you did .  
well ,  chandler ,  youre gonna have to tell him .  
because you do .  
hey !  samboucha margarita ?  
well ,  we only had samboucha ,  so it is now .  
whats up ?  
you do ?  
well ,  youre timing couldnt be better .  shes not my girlfriend anymore .  
yeah ,  she broke up with me .  
just now ,  after acting class .  at first i thought she was doing some kind of scene ,  thats why i let people watch .  
well ,  ive been better .  but ,  im all right .  so you like her huh ?  
no - no - no ,  no its uh ,  its okay .  
yeah .  you know why ?  cause you came to me first .  
but hey ,  listen just so you know ,  you might have youre work cut out for you .  cause when i talked to her ,  i kinda got the feeling that shes into some other guy .  so 
who ?  
what ?  
and what ?  !  did you sleep with her ?  !  
what ?  !  !  thats even worse !  !  
i dont know !  but its the same !  
who cares ?  !  you went behind my back !  i would never do that to you !  
over the line ?  !  you - youre - youre so far past the line ,  that you - you cant even see the line !  the line is a dot to you !  
is that why you bought all this stuff ?  !   well ,  yknow what i will not watch your tv ,  i will not listen to your stereo ,  and theres a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that im not gonna eat !  you know why ?  !  
 hello .  
 hello .  
so are things with you and joey any better ?  
i know ,  but all that work youre doing to get it ready ,  i just  
i picked her !  oh thank god you want her !  ooh !  
because she exchanges every gift she ever gets ,  its like impossible to get her something she likes .  come on ,  lets trade !  
well ,  maybe you could give to somebody else .  ooh ,  like ross geller .  
who cares ?  he works in a museum !  
you dont have to do that ,  ross and joey arent here ,  you can watch the parade if you want .  
 people are trying to sleep in here !  
oh ,  yknow what ,  i cant ,  it really kills .  
no ,  my eye doctor is richard !  i cant go to him when i dont have a boyfriend !  
okay ,  get out of my kitchen !  
so listen ah ,  i picked monica for secret santa ,  but im already getting her something for chanukah ,  i was wondering if you wanna switch .  
really ?  !  wow !  thats - thats so nice ,  what are you gonna get me ?  
yeah ,  well maybe phoebe will switch with me .  
oh ,  thats not true !  ive got her lots of stuff she never took back .  
like uh ,  that gold necklace i got her last year .  
well ,  she wore it all christmas day ,  and then uh 
oh my god ,  is it really that bad ?  
oh .  
my folks .  
i dont know .  i might stay there for a few days while i look for an apartment .  
yeah ,  yknow at first i thought we could talk about this yknow ,  work it out ,  but uh ,  seeing you two together i dont think i 
look ,  its not about her .  okay ?  but seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did .  and i dont want to live with some one who doesnt know what it is to be a friend .  so ,  ill see ya .   
yeah !  you did !  and thats why im leaving .   
when that guy was robbing us ,  and i was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours ,  you know what i was doing in there all that time ?  i was thinking about how i let you down !  
yeah !  but if wouldve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be ,  i wouldnt have worried about it so much !  see you around !  
ewwwww !  !  ew !  ew !  ew !  
chandler ?  
 now ,  well see .  
and rachel .   and thats chandler .  
hes doin some thinkin !   
oh ,  ill get it .   
that doesnt sound like thinking to me !  
yknow i dont think you should be talking at all in there !  i think youve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes !  
okay ,  fine .    
all right ,  look !  if this is just a big joke to you ,  then forget about it ,  all right ?  !  this means something to me !  and if it doesnt mean anything to you ,  then you should get out of there ,  otherwise youre just an idiot in a box !  
so are you gonna start taking this thing seriously ?  
he can still catch her !  come on ,  get out of there !   get out of there !  
yeah ,  were gonna be fine !  get out !  
yeah ,  you did some real good thinkin in there .  
come on ,  no peeking !

yesterday &apos;s pages did not reflect my best work .  
dude ,  if you think fireball &apos;s relaxing ,  you &apos;ve obviously have never played .

hey !   dude ,  some guy just called for you .  
okay listen ,  yknow when you move in rachels room is gonna be empty ,  you wanna talk about what we want to do with it ?  
okay ,  i was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room ,  right ?  with a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time !  and we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here !  !  okay ,  whatever ,  i really havent thought about it that much .  
no .  
oh ,  im sorry .  of course i mean that .  interesting idea ,  umm ,  talk about it ,  but no .  
i just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room .  the beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques .  
what do you have against the beautiful guest room ?  
are you mocking me ?  
hey ,  whats up ?  
but youre still moving in together ,  right ?  because my ad came out today .   
hi .  
stop it chandler .   im sorry too .  
yeah !  oh yes !

totally !   
oh good .

youre - youre - youre gonna bring the barca lounger over here ?  
well ,  its a set and they should probably stay together .

look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly !  
whoa !  !  now look ,  dont be just blurtin stuff out .  i want you to really think about your answers .  okay ?  
oh dont listen to him ,  hes just some guy who really wants the apartment ,  but i dont think hes gonna get it .  
well ,  apparently not ,  and i cant just stand by and watch two people i care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly .  i mean ,  enough of the silliness !  
 okay - okay !  two very good points ,  look ive known you both a long time ,  and ive never seen either of you one / millionth as happy as youve been since youve got together .  do you really want to throw that all away over a room ?  that is so silly .  now wh - what is more important ,  love or silliness ?  
love is the best medicine .  
why do you do it ?  
okay !  all right !  now ,  chandler you - you wanna live with monica ,  right ?  
thats very funny !  
okay ,  there are no stupid fights !  !  this isnt about the room ,  this is about what the room represents !  and unfortunately ,  this room  could destroy you !  !  
you still want to move in together right ?  
ross didnt scare you ?  
come here ,  i want to show you something !  
okay !   ,  the coffee table forward  ,  and taped a square outline on the floor . )

so ,  i just finished this fascinating book .  by the year 2030 ,  there &apos;ll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain .  so theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and - and - and live forever as a machine .  
 honey ,  that &apos;s a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor !  
oh ,  so you can move them !  
i didn &apos;t know that !  well ,  what a pretty last name !

 hi !  
terrible .  if - if i want something done right ,  i have to do it myself .  other people just wreck stuff .  i really think i might kill someone tonight .  
it &apos;s worse .  the only thing that &apos;s getting me through is knowing that i &apos;m gonna be seeing you soon .  i think i may even try to get out of here early .  
well ,  are you just hanging out with ross ?  
yeah that - that ,  doesn &apos;t look right .  
whoa ,  whoa ,  but then the back of the couch won &apos;t line up with he back of the carpet .  
whoa ,  whoa ,  whoa ,  but then the coffee table won &apos;t be centered in the seating area .  
look ,  we do not repel women ok ?  that is completely untrue .  
yeah ,  well what about you ?  you weren &apos;t you know ,  so hot in college either .  after everything he said ,  he &apos;d go  &quot; ba dum bum chessh &quot;  
oh y &apos;know what ,  girls don &apos;t like it when i start talking about science .  
uh ,  they don &apos;t like it when you correct their grammar .  
they don &apos;t like it when you keep asking them if they like you .  
who cares ?  i repel women .   
 what ?  !  
is it the same thing that chandler had ?  
okay ,  listen ,  there &apos;s still some of chandler &apos;s medicine under the sink in the bathroom .  bye !

bye !   
well ,  the end table is wrong ,  the couch looks bizarre and don &apos;t even get me started on the refrigerator magnets .  
it &apos;s okay .  chandler ,  are you afraid of me or something ?  
of course not .  i mean gosh ,  chandler what you did ,  it &apos;s ,  it &apos;s a wonderful thing and i really appreciate it .  i know i have this weird thing where i want everything to be in the perfect place ,  but i &apos;d never expect you to worry about that .

so that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday ,  you dont really believe that do you ?

how ?  i dont have any money .  
how much ?  
 ohh ,  you guys are so made for each other .  
well ,  youre not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding ?  
this is the most special day of our lives .  
honey ,  umm i - i love you ,   but umm ,  if you call our wedding a party one more time ,  you may not get invited .  okay ?   listen ,  we could always earn more money ,  okay ?  but uh ,  were only gonna get married once .  
you - youre gonna have to put your foot down ?  
hey .  
listen umm ,  ive been thinking ,  its not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding .  i mean ,  you work ,  you work really hard for that .  
eh ,  you work for that .  
you do ?  !  
oh ,  youre so sweet .   oh ,  but wait ,  what about our ,  what about the future and stuff ?  
you thought about that ?  
how many kids were we gonna have ?  
what else did you think about ?  
 yknow what ?  i - i dont want a big ,  fancy wedding .  
no ,  i want everything you just said .  i want a marriage .  
uh - hmm .

 ahoy !  
oh ,  its great !  its a great place to just kinda ,  sit ,  hang around ,  drink a few beers ,  eat some chips .   
what ?  
 hey chandler ,  what are you doing tonight ?  
no ,  why ?  
yeah and he didnt really ask for you ,  he asked for chancy ,  i assumed he meant you .  
he hates to lose .  
youre not a lefty ?  
oh ,  we have to get you an engagement present ?  
okay ,  here i wish you health and happiness .   
see no - no ,  i made a batch and i froze it ,  and this is the only one left .  
why not ?  
yeah !  i bet i can do it .   
well i had a great time !  umm ,  chancy on the other hand 
and what did he ask you not to call him ?  
daddy .  all right look ,  heres the story .   well ,  we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam .  i walk into the steam room and it was really steamy .   so i take off my glasses and thats when it happened .   
oh my god chandler !  i cant believe it !  
you gave my father a lap dance !  
cause otherwise theyd have to call it the room room .

you were trying to eat it !   
 yeah ,  and - and you better make sure he tips you this time .  
i understand completely ,  theres nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in - laws .  as a matter of fact ,  when i started dating judy i was unemployed ,  and her father asked me what i did for a living and i told him i was a lawyer .  
they never did ,  so if you ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along .  shall we ?

she was like 30 ,  dark hair ,  attractive .  
come on ,  was it somebody maybe you dated in college ?  
what are you doing ?  
oh my god yes !  who is she ?  
did you break up with her ?

you broke up with a girl because she was fat ?  !  
well ,  apparently she does .  
chandler !   chandler !  i just figured out who you are !  
youre lewis posin .  
lewis posin !  he was my best friend in fifth grade ,  and - and then one day i asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no .  do you know why ?  
no !  but because he thought i was too faaaaa  .   and every time i think about it ,  it makes me feel as bad as i did in fifth grade !  yknow ,  i - i really think that you should apologize to julie .  
no ,  i know .  but yknow what ?  it would make me feel better if lewis apologized to me .  
hello skidmark .  
its pretty clear .  
thats why you broke up with me ?  
why dont you just stop doing stupid things ?  then you wouldnt have to apologize .  
all right ,  i i have to ask .  
are you gonna break up with me if i get fat again ?  
well ,  you broke up with julie grath !  how much weight could she have gained ?  
in one year ?  !  my god what did she eat ?  her - her family !  thats not the point .  
well thats not the only time this was an issue .  you remember when umm ,  you spent thanksgiving with us ?  you called me fat .  
how ?  
what if i have babies ,  okay ?  i mean im gonna look different .  im okay with that ,  but im not sure that you are !  
keep going .  
even if i shrink down to two inches tall ?  
i love you .   
okay ,  okay take a guess .   
okay ,  okay ,  i was typing names into the library computer earlier ,  yknow - yknow for fun ,  and i typed mine in and guess what came up ?  my doctoral dissertation !  its here !  yeah ,  its right - its right down here !  in the biggest library in the university !   
 oh umm ,  theres also a book here by a woman named wendy bagina .   what is that ?  
sounds like two people are really enjoying the dewey decimal system .   
so ,  whos the lucky guy ?   
well ,  she saw the ring .  
well ,  she was shocked when i told her ,  but then again so were most people .  
well ,  she actually has a boyfriend yknow herself ,  named clark .  uh ,  she also kinda invited herself to our wedding .  clark too .  
huh ?  
well ,  she cornered me !  she asked if the wedding was in town !  i mean ,  what was i supposed to do ?  !  
come on !  so she comes to the wedding !  i mean it wont be so bad .  
oh my god ,  shes not gonna like the chicken that night either ,  is she ?  !  
really ?  
so - so you wouldve just lied ?  
would it really have been that easy ?  
i should just go on to happier things ,  okay ?  umm ,  why dont you tell about your lovely wedding ?  
what are we gonna do ?  
chandler ?  
please ,  its because otherwise i really dont know what i might do .  
well just well just let her stay .  
kinda like your barcalounger .  
hey you guys ,  umm do either one of you want to get in there before i take my bath .  
why not ?  
he does ?  
thats right .  thats right .  and that is why you cant stay here tonight .  and probably why you shouldnt come to the wedding .  
 hey everybody !  happy thanksgiving !  
what ,  are we keeping thanksgiving a secret this year ?  
what ?  that &apos;s like insanely easy !  
nobody cares about the dakotas .    
all right ,  i got 48 .  
oh ,  i got tired of naming states .  so i decided to list the types of 
hey !  how is new england not a state ?  huh ?  they have a sports team !  
done !  with time - a to spare .  
you know ,  i hate to lecture you guys ,  but it &apos;s kinda disgraceful ,  that a group of well - educated adults and joey can &apos;t name all the states .  did you ever see a map ,  or one of those round ,  colorful things called  &quot; a globe ?  &quot;  hmm ?  
all right ,  i &apos;m out of oven space .  i &apos;m gonna turn on joey &apos;s .  please ,  watch him !  do not let joey eat any of the food !  
no ,  just give me another minute .  
this - this is crazy !  i can do this !  all right ,  uhh ,  i bet i can get all 50 before dinner .  
chandler ?  can you give me a hand ?   
rosss apartment is nice !  how come we don &apos;t hang out here more often ?  
that &apos;s my pie !

oooh ,  i wish she could stay here ,  but chandler is allergic !  
that &apos;s odd ,   &apos;cause this dog &apos;s been living here for the past 3 days 
chandler ,  if that dog &apos;s been here that long ,  and you haven &apos;t had a reaction ,  maybe you &apos;re not allergic to this dog ?  
well ,  it still has to go ,  right ?  
don &apos;t do what ?  
told ya .   
wait a minute .  do you not like all dogs ?  i mean ,  not even puppies ?  
you don &apos;t like puppies ?

um ,  in phoebe &apos;s room .  you can &apos;t go in there .  
monica &apos;s crying .  she &apos;s very upset about this whole clunkers thing .

 shh ,  wait and see .  maybe we will ,  maybe we won &apos;t .  
 hi !  
it &apos;s a thanksgiving miracle !  
okay ,  maybe this is so hard ,  because there aren &apos;t 50 states .  let me tell you something ,  i have 49 states ,  and there are no more !  i - i think ,  i should be able to eat something .

making holiday candy for the neighbors .  
im gonna hang this basket  on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece .

do you realize that four weeks from today were getting married ?  four weeks baby !  !  four weeks !  !  !  
theres still so much to do .  have you written your vows yet ?  
sweetie ,  you know i have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding .  
no !  but i know exactly what im going to say .  
 lets just do it right now .  okay ?  it wont be hard .  just say whats in your heart .   
well with carol ,  i promised never to love another woman until the day i die .  she made no such promise .  
well ,  why dont you just start with something simple .  like umm ,  monica from the moment i met you ,  i knew i loved you .  
 .  .  . everyone ,  this is chandler !  
okay .  okay .  okay .  umm ,  maybe you can start with ,   &quot; chandler ,  even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew i wanted more .  &quot;   
now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones .   you got one ,  two three ,  four  ,  five ,  six ,  and seven !  
its kind of an important one !  
oh ,  i got it !  how about saying something like ,   &quot; monica 
 &quot;  when i look back over our time together  &quot;  
no fair .  i don &apos;t even have one .  how come they get two ?  
oh yeah ?  when ?  
why won &apos;t i be married when i &apos;m 40 ?  
ok ,  hypothetically ,  why won &apos;t i be married when i &apos;m 40 ?  
what is it ?  is there something fundamentally unmarriageable about me ?  
well ?  
 do you think he knew i was here ?    
wait ,  wait ,  wait !   
look !   
i bet this will work !   
what ?

yes ,  you did !  
you love me !  
no i don &apos;t !  stop it !  stop it !  stop it !  stop it !    
then all your stuff would be here .

you wanted it to be a surprise .   
chandler in all my life i never thought i would be so lucky .   as to fall in love with my best my best theres a reason why girls dont do this !

is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache ?  
isn &apos;t that sad ?  i mean ,  can you see how pathetic that is ?  you shouldn &apos;t be jealous .  you should feel bad for him .  
chandler ,  this is not our problem .  we &apos;ve got each other .  that &apos;s all that matters .  
cowboy boots ?  i &apos;ve never worn cowboy boots in my whole life !   
that &apos;s not me !  
that bastard taped over me !   
hey hon ?  would you help me get the plates down ?

connected ?  i mean .  .  . to what ?  she &apos;s a lump !  
ok ,  how bout this .  if you guys die ,  and the crazy plate lady dies .  .  . then do i get the baby .

that &apos;ll work !  
okay ,  now we just need something borrowed !

eh ,  you work for that .  
you do ?  !  
oh ,  you &apos;re so sweet .   oh ,  but wait ,  what about our ,  what about the future and stuff ?

no ,  i want everything that you just said .  i want a marriage .  
uh - hmm .  
okay ,  fine .  let &apos;s talk about snow .   -  -  do you think it &apos;s snowing in tulsa ,  where my husband is having sex on a copying machine ?   
what are you doing here ?  
hey ,  hey ,  uh ,  who did you miss the most ?

what ,  you ,  you really quit your job ?  
what do you really want to do ?  
oh my god !  
no ,  i think that this is what you wanna do ,  i think it &apos;s great !  
chandler ,  your being here is the best christmas present i could have ever imagined .  
 thank you .  
wha .  .  .  are you kidding ?  i can &apos;t return this .  
mine &apos;s is to lilian myers .  
good morning ,  tiger !  i &apos;m making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight .  you &apos;re gonna get me good and pregnant .  
well ,  i just lost my erection .  
you &apos;re supposed to find your passion in life .  you can be whatever you wanna be now .  it &apos;s exciting .  
hey ,  wait a second .  i can help you with this .  you just need to be organized .  we can make a list of your qualifications ,  and categorize jobs by industry .  there could be folders and files !  
 okay ,  i have looked through a bunch of career guides ,  photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision .  
okay .  let us start with the a &apos;s .  advertising .  
don &apos;t you want to look through the rest ?  
you call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time ?  ooh ,  now i get to use my shredder !  
i got one .   &quot; socks .  because your family &apos;s feet deserve the best .  &quot;  
i actually know someone in advertising .  i grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency .  maybe i can get him to meet you ?  give me the phone .  
so ,  do you have any other question about advertising ?  
monica warned me you might do that .  i actually think we might have something for you at the agency .  
it &apos;s an unpaid internship .  
come on now .  monica has a good job .  and it &apos;s not like you have a family to support .  
so you have to tell monica you don &apos;t want to have a baby right now ?  
 okay ,  it &apos;s baby time .  pants off bing .   didn &apos;t see you there geller .  
hey .  
you have a blue tie that would go with this ?  emma spit up on mine .  
 sorry .   but i kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night .  
what are you talking about ?  
you faked it ?  you couldn &apos;t have faked it !  
guys can fake it ?  unbelievable .  the one thing that &apos;s ours !  besides ,  why would you fake it when we &apos;re trying to have a baby ?  
like a month ?  
really ,  you want to wait a year ?  
i really wanna have a baby .  
no ,  i want you to have a job that you love .  not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration .  
it &apos;s just ,  i think ,  there &apos;s never gonna be a right time to have a baby .  i mean ,  now you &apos;re unemployed and in a little while you &apos;ll find a new job that &apos;ll keep you really busy .  there &apos;s always gonna be a reason not to do this ,  but i think once the baby comes ,  forget about all those reasons .  
it &apos;s gonna be really scary .  i mean ,  god .  when we have a baby ,  there &apos;s gonna be so much that we &apos;re not able to control .  i mean ,  the apartment &apos;s gonna be a mess ,  i won &apos;t have time to clean it .  what if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer ?  messes up all the ribbons ?  !  what if there &apos;s no room for a ribbon drawer ,  because the baby &apos;s stuff takes up all the space !  ?  where will all the ribbons go !  ?  !  
yes ,  please !  
hey .  so where &apos;s mon ?  
and you &apos;re not helping ?  
yeah .  
what ?  you really think she &apos;s hot ?  
thank you !   
would you stop staring at her ?  
yeah ,  obvious beauty &apos;s the worst .  you know ,  when it &apos;s right there in your face .  me ,  i like to have to work to find someone attractive .  makes me feel like i earned it .  
whazzup ?  ?  
listen ,  can you do me a favor ?  i &apos;m gonna be out today .  can you just keep an eye on joey ,  make sure nothing happens between him and molly ?  
wh  -  no .  some woman who sounded a lot like joey called earlier and asked for her daughter ,  the  &quot; hot nanny &quot;  .  
you do appear right on the cusp of something .  come on man ,  i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll lose interest in a week or two ,  but for now can you please just do this for me ?  
well we gotta do something ,  ok ?  nannies like her don &apos;t grow on trees .   
for a walk .  
actually ,  that will be long .  you know ,  i really need to organize my thoughts .  
allright ,  fine ,  i only have one thought !  it &apos;s about the hot nanny ,  i gotta see her !  
now you &apos;re telling me i can &apos;t see her ?  ?  you guys are killing me !  she &apos;s forbidden fruit !  it &apos;s like  .  .  .  like she &apos;s the princess and i &apos;m the stable boy  .  .  .  why are you doing this ,  huh ?  did ross tell you not to let me go over there ?  
huh .  interesting .  now there are obstacles .  hot nanny and me against the world .  this is the kind of stuff great novels are made of .  
where the hell are joey and molly ?  i asked you to watch them .  
we have to stop them before something happens !  
see ?  why ,  gavin ,  why ?  right when i &apos;m about to change my opinion of you ,  you go and you  .  .  .   and you do that  .  .  .    ending credits 
 hey 
listen ,  i think i &apos;ve left something here .  
 no ,  but i like it .  i think i left one of my rat babies .  
yeah !  yeah !  ok !  sure !  look !  can we .  .  . can we talk about what happened here last night ?  
ok you .  .  . you really don &apos;t know what i am talking about ?  
ok !  last night after the party i saw rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony .  
right that &apos;s why i came over to talk about .  hum .  .  . i saw rachel kissing some guy on your balcony ,  even though there were no lights  !  
why .  .  . why should i ?  i mean if she wants to move on ,  that &apos;s fine !  
no i &apos;m serious .  i mean she wants to date people ?  fine !  i don &apos;t care but .  .  . at least she could have told me .  you know i .  .  . i &apos;ve been putting my life on hold and just concentrating on emma but if she wants to go out there kissing guys she barely knows ,  then so will i  !  very funny !  ross is gay !  ah !  ah !  
i don &apos;t know .  i mean i have plenty of opportunity .  just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me .  and then the other day on the subway a woman  &quot; accidentally &quot;  sat on my hand .  
well ,  and how about this ?  there is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter - departmental potluck dinner .  
not well .  i went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants .  
that &apos;s funny .  .  . do you think you &apos;ll ever work again ?  
i can &apos;t believe rachel just moved on and didn &apos;t say anything to me 
no no ,  about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar .  
no .  when he called ,  i .  .  . i threw the message away .  
you know what ?  enough !  enough talking !  i have to get moving !  hey check out those two blondes over there !  hey come with me !  
you don &apos;t have to do anything .  it will just be easier if it is the two of us ,  like college ,  remember ?  you .  .  . you break the ice with some kind of jokes so that they know you &apos;re the funny one and i swoop in with some interesting conversation ,  so they &apos;ll see that i &apos;m the brilliant ,  brooding ,  sexy one .  .  .  
don &apos;t you have to be at work ?  
hum .  .  . so .  .  . hum .  .  . oh hey i noticed you were reading the paper .  .  . another would you rather drown or be burnt alive ?  &quot;  
right ,  so that &apos;s a firm  &quot; no &quot;  .  i cannot believe this ,  i just keep striking out .  
this is great .  rachel &apos;s gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and i &apos;m gonna die alone .  
all i ever wanted was just love him and have him love me back .  i mean ,  am i so unlovable ?  
hey ,  i need your help .  
look ,  i &apos;ll get new headshot taken ,  all right ,  so i want to get my eyebrows shaped 
you may be a sissy but i &apos;ll still  .  all right ,  it hurts so bad ,  i could only let her do one eyebrow and now .  .  .  they dont match !  
all right ,  look ,  you got to help me out ,  ok ?  look ,  i have the magic marker ,  i want you to fill in the skinny one so i dont look stupid for my pictures .

what ,  what .  
oh my god !  
ok all right ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  i do ,  i do ,  i do ,  i need your help ,  but chandler i dont know if i can take anymore plucking .  it hurts so bad !  
oh my god !  i didnt feel a thing  !  hey ,  are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles around that sadistic bitch at the saloon 
yeah ,  yeah .  hey ,  they totally match !  they look great !  they look great !  how you doing !  
thank you so much .

oh youll probably take care of that on your hands .  
honey ,  youre just in time ,  im about to sing another song !  
and they love me !  
 &quot; tonight &apos;s the night we &apos;re gonna make it happen ,  tonight we &apos;ll put all other things aside .  give in this time and show me some affection .  .  .  &quot;  
oh ?  isnt that funny ?  i didn &apos;t see that before ,  i wouldn &apos;t have let her go up again .  
oh ,  who cares ,  they still love me !   &quot; i am so excited .  .  .  &quot;  
your eyebrows look weird .   
you guys aren &apos;t doing anything tonight ,  are you ?  
oh my god .  
what ,  slept together a year and a half ago ?  yeah ,  i &apos;m all set .  
emma ?  emma ?  look at me !  well ,  i think i &apos;ll go downstairs for a while .   
okay ,  just so you know ,  i &apos;m gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth ,  so don &apos;t touch yourself in the next 48 hours .  
i don &apos;t do that .   
yeah .  
no ,  it &apos;s not .   
oh my god .  today &apos;s the sixth ?  !  i may be done ovulating !  i may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant .  
okay .   
hey ,  where are all my ovulation - sticks ?  there &apos;s only one here .  
chandler !  
we &apos;re okay .  i &apos;m still ovulating .  
so ,  let &apos;s do this .  
come on .  i know you &apos;re not eighteen anymore ,  but give it a minute .  
oh my god ,  emma .  oh ,  sweetie ,  i forgot you were here .  oh ,  you &apos;re right ,  we can &apos;t do this .  we can &apos;t leave her alone .  
unless .  .  .  maybe we do it here .  i mean ,  how much can she even be aware of at this age ?  
canoodling ?  
i don &apos;t know .  i mean ,  i guess having sex in front of a baby isn &apos;t so .  .  .  
i guess you &apos;re right .  
what are you doing ?  
she &apos;s asleep .  
well ,  that was weird .  you were loud ,  and i was fast .  
oh ,  i wish i didn &apos;t have to wait to take a pregnancy test .  
you may wanna get some more of those too .   
oh my god ,  where &apos;s emma ?  where &apos;s emma ?  
okay ,  okay ,  i &apos;m sure that rachel came home early and picked up emma .  you go look across the hall ,  and i &apos;ll call her cell .  
don &apos;t you lie to me !  i could tell by chandler &apos;s hair .   you are so lazy .  can &apos;t you get on top for once ?  
hey !  it is unacceptable that you two would have sex with emma in the next room .  i &apos;m gonna have to tell rachel about this .   
unless you name your firstborn child joey .  
hey ,  i may never have kids ,  and somebody &apos;s gotta carry on my family name .  
what &apos;s your news ?  
 gosh ,  what &apos;s the pay like ?   oh ,  come on people  come on ,  now ,  if i don &apos;t know who makes the most ,  how do i know who i like the most !   hey joey !   
oh ,  that &apos;s cool .  we have interns at  &apos;days of our lives &apos; .  
so ,  uh ,  what kinda stuff do you think they &apos;ll have you do there ?  
 that &apos;s great .  
yeah ,  i mean ,  there &apos;s probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink ,  you know ,  grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating  
can i get you a cup of coffee ,  sir ?  
seriously ,  you &apos;re an intern ?  
 dude !  
right .  look ,  i know i &apos;m a little bit older than you guys ,  but it &apos;s not like i &apos;m bob hope   
so far so good !   
 what &apos;s wrong ?  
so you &apos;re a little older .  try to look at the positive all this life experience .  
what are they ?   
 i give you $ 500 for them !  
ah ,  come on ,  sneakers are easy .  you wear sneakers all the time .  
okay ,  have you considered using a girl with huge knockers ?  
hey !  
what are you doing ?  
oh ,  anything yet ?  
we gotta get more of that .   
okay ,  first of all ,  that &apos;s stupid and second of all ,  i &apos;m not allowed to talk to ralph .

 that &apos;s interesting !  just one thought mention the shoes .  who &apos;s next ?   chander 
 your age ?  
chandler ,  that &apos;s great !  
you see ?  that has a clear selling point .  it appeals to our key demographic ,  it &apos;s  .   you did you come up with that ?  
see all of you tomorrow .    
i know .  .  . god .  i haven &apos;t seen my savings take a hit like this since i was a kid and they came up with double - stuffed oreos .  what happened to all our money ?  
i guess with you doing the internship ,  we &apos;re just spending more than we &apos;re bringing in .  
oh ,  but you &apos;re finally doing something that you love !  i can &apos;t ask you to give that up .  though it &apos;d be nice if the thing that you love was y &apos;know .  .  .  finding gold .  
ok worse case scenario is .  .  . we borrow some money from my parents .  
why not ?  
wow !  i had no idea you had this much pride .  
well you know it &apos;s just like living with a girl .  only they don &apos;t steal your makeup .  unless they &apos;re playing  &quot; this is what my sister would look like &quot;   
we don &apos;t do that !  tell her we don &apos;t do that !  
hey !  
i thought you didn &apos;t have secrets from monica .  
yeah ,  i know .  
err .  .  .  i just figured it out !  you know ,  i mean you &apos;re not working and the economy is bad .  
 that &apos;s the fastest i have ever thought !  
oh !  sure !  how much ?  two thousand dollars ?  
err .  .  . well i .  .  . know how much you used to make and i know how much your rent is .   
err .  .  .  kind of .  
oh no no no no no .  .  .  it wasn &apos;t .  .  .  it wasn &apos;t because of your money problems ,  it was for something for her .  
something personal .  
thanks .  .  .  .  .   
thank you ?  
ok ,  you &apos;re being wierd .  do you want sex or did you do something bad ?  
ok .  . you know the old classics you know , you look nice ?  they &apos;re still ok .  
okay .  .  .  
honey ?  
about that ?  erm .  .  . i &apos;m going to change .

well ,  my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not !  and you know what ?  it &apos;s not just my breasts .  my ass is going to get bigger too .  
man ,  don &apos;t be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too !  
it &apos;s kind of a package deal !  
i thought i was something that we both wanted !  
oh my god chandler !  if you can &apos;t handle this ,  what are you going to be like in the hospital ?  with the blood and the screaming and the little present that &apos;s shooting out of her !  ?  
hey hey ,  can i help ?  
someday .  
we &apos;re all sorry .  .  .   
hey ross ,  check this out !   yeah ,  i can &apos;t do that !  
have you seen this ?  it &apos;s a new alumni website for college !  it &apos;s cool !  you can post messages for people ,  let everyone know what you &apos;re up to .  
it &apos;s actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing .  .  .  remember andrea rich ?  
uh uh .  .  .  well ,  her internet company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident .  .  .  
no .  .  .  i already e - mailed her .  
 what do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes ?  ?   
breaking up sucks !  oh ,  i really miss mike !  
oh god ,  i tried everything to make myself feel better .  i even tried writing a song about it .  .  .  but .  .  .  i can &apos;t think of anything that rhymes with aarrgghh !  !   hey monica ,  i really need your help getting through this .  .  .  
well no ,  when i get to the point where .  .  .  you know .  .  .  i &apos;m ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about mike .  .  .  i &apos;m gonna come to you .  
 i have sex with dinosaurs ?  ?  
that only is not funny ,  it &apos;s physically impossible !  ok ?  depending on the species i &apos;d have to have a six foot long .  .  .   it &apos;s not funny !  !  
i can &apos;t believe you put that on my alumni page !  
you &apos;d better hope not because i just read what you put on your page today .  
alright ,  wait a second ,  why would ross tell everyone in your class that you are as .  .  .    &quot; gay as the day is long &quot;  ?  
but that &apos;s clearly a joke .  this could easily be true .   
 hello ?  no ,  he &apos;s not here .  yeah ,  this is his wife .  yeah ,  well ,  it came as quite a shock to me too .  i guess i should have known .  yeah ,  i mean ,  he just kept making me watch moulin rouge .  
what are you doing ?  
 i &apos;m dead ?  
posting that i died ?  that really isn &apos;t funny .  
oh please ,  hit by a blimp ?  
unbelievable ,  my classmates are gonna think i &apos;m dead ,  my professors ,  my .  .  .  my parents are gonna get phone calls .  you &apos;re messing with people &apos;s feelings here .  
uhu uhu ,  check this out .   
eh .  . actually no ,  i don &apos;t need to because your little  &quot; ross is dead &quot;  joke didn &apos;t work ,  ok ,  there were no responses .  nobody posted anything on the website ,  nobody called my parents ,  so the joke my friend is on you .  nobody called ,  nobody wrote anything ,  nobody cares that i &apos;m dead .   oh my god !  nobody cares that i &apos;m dead !  ?  
what are you talking about ?  you get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet !  i didn &apos;t get one response !  and i &apos;m dead !  
i can &apos;t believe this .  not even my geology lab partner ?  and i carried that guy !   
you &apos;re right .  there isn &apos;t a decent outlet .  
exactly !  !   
no !  that would be stupid !  you &apos;re having it for me !  
it &apos;s been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up !  i tell you ,  when i actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted !   
hi ,  glad you could come .  
hi ,  you &apos;re chandler bing ,  right ?  i &apos;m tom gordon ,  i was in your class .  
thanks .  .  .  uh .  .  .  i &apos;m so sorry about ross ,  it &apos;s .  .  .  
who is he ?  
what ?  you .  .  .  you .  .  .  oh !  can i ask you a personal question ?  ho - how do you shave your beard so close ?  
 hey ,  listen .  call me .  
i look like a man ?  ?  
it isn &apos;t ridiculous ,  look around !  no one &apos;s here !  
yes ,  you &apos;re right .  still somebody must have seen it .  .  .  i mean ,  i went to that school for 4 years ,  i didn &apos;t have an impact on anyone ?  
 yeah .  .  .   oh ,  great .  more party boys for chandler !  
hi .  i &apos;m here for ross geller &apos;s memorial service .  
yeah .  .  .  
and you are .  .  .  
you are married though .  
i can &apos;t believe that ross is gone .  it is just so sad .  
we weren &apos;t but we had one class together .  he was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science .  i always remembered him .  
yeah with chandler not getting paid ,  we could really use 300 million dollars .  
uh .  .  . sure i do ,  and i also wanna be king of my own country and find out what happened to amelia earhart .  
no !  do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery ?  i .  .  . i mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times .  
seriously you guys ,  i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery ,  i mean that &apos;s such a bunch of boohaki .  
well when i talk to her i almost feel like she understands what i &apos;m saying .  
god !  look at all these tickets !  it &apos;s so exciting !  you know i haven &apos;t won anything since the sixth grade .  
oh !  you assume because i was heavy that &apos;s the only way i could win something ?  
yeah ,  uh .  .  .  and then i figured after you win ,  we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it !   
think he washed his hands ?  
look who &apos;s coming around !  
did you get it ?  
by you !  ?  
oh !  i hate that guy !  i mean come on kid !  pull up your pants !  
well ,  there &apos;s two spots left right ?  
ok ,  i &apos;ve heard myself on tape and i sound nothing like that .  
why would i eat my own arm ?  
get a room !  
i don &apos;t know ,  probably just invest it .  
 you would do that ?  i never get picked !  
you &apos;re not gonna let me buy the knicks ?  ?  i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re taking this away from me !  
 uh ,  how long until they announce the numbers ,  mommy ?   
 well that depends  .  .  .  have you been a baaad gi  .  .   no i can &apos;t .   
dude ,  i &apos;m sorry .  but hey ,  there &apos;s one spot left ,  right ?  
hey ,  don &apos;t say that !  you got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job !  
yeah .  
there are no tickets on the nightstand !  
un ,  no you didn &apos;t !  you must be mistaken !  
chandler ,  would you just tell her what she did was wrong ?  
ahhh !   
hey ,  if anybody gets extra tickets ,  it should be me !  this all thing was my idea !   
don &apos;t come any closer !  
as a matter of fact she said that &apos;s how i am going to die .   so ,  excuse me for being a little skittish .  
oh ,  play them !  
well ,  i bet that was very hard for him to do .  
oh ,  it is so unfair .  it &apos;s like that time they promoted sandra over me at work .  
 honey ,  you &apos;ve been really strong about this ,  i know how badly you wanted that job .  
 &quot; here we are ,  the official powerball numbers !  we have 53 &quot;  
 damnit !  anybody got anything ?  
 hello ?  hold on .  it &apos;s your boss .  
chandler ,  hi !  i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve heard we filled the three positions .  we just felt that with your maturity and experience ,  you wouldn &apos;t be happy being someone &apos;s assistant .  
chandler ,  you were the strongest person in the program .  we &apos;re offering you the position of junior copywriter .  
yes ,  that &apos;s right .  we &apos;re excited about the level of sophistication you &apos;ll be bringing to the job .  
ok well ,  thanks ,  you won &apos;t regret it .  i &apos;ll see you tomorrow  .   
oh sweetie ,  i &apos;m so proud of you !  
 hey ,  that is so great about the job .  
and i like to think i had a little something to do with it .  
well ,  before ,  with the wishbone .  .  .  i didn &apos;t wish we would win the lottery ,  i wished you &apos;d get the job .  
i know that ,  but look ,  we &apos;ve got the powerball number ,  we &apos;ve won 3 dollars !  
you know what ?  you can have mine .  
well ,  it was an accident .  .  . you know ,  it &apos;s a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips !   
oh no ! you guys aren &apos;t supposed to get divorced for 7 years !  
oh ,  good ! ok ,  good for you ! try to recapture the magic !  
oh ,  honey ! i can &apos;t .  i was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant !  
yeah ,  i &apos;m sorry .  i really am .  
and tell them that in 2 weeks i will once again be a masseuse in good standing !  
oh ,  don &apos;t worry about it !  just use your travel insurance .  
welcome to the chestnut inn mr .  bing ,  so where are you joining from ?  
 the big apple !  
i am sorry mr .  bing ,  there &apos;s no record of your reservation in the computer .

unfortunatly the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite ,  the rate is six hundred dollars .  
totally insane .  dude ,  let &apos;s drive home ,  we &apos;ll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if .  .  . if they &apos;re closed maybe we &apos;ll tap a tree and make some ourselves .  
great .  
dude ,  don &apos;t worry  &apos;bout it !  i know how we can make your money back !  this is a nice hotel ,  you know ,  plenty of amenities ,  we just load up on those !  like those apples .  instead of taking one ,  i &apos;m .  .  .  i take six !  
c &apos;mon ,  you get the idea ,  ow - ow - ow we &apos;ll make our money back in no time !

no ,  chandler ,  you have to find the line between stealing and taking conditioners ,  yes ,  yes ,  yes .   now ,  the salt shaker is off - limits ,  but the salt  i wish i &apos;d thought this through .  
not my first time in a hotel ,  my friend .  
no ,  no ,  no ,  you can &apos;t take the remote control !  
yes ,  but the batteries .  .  .   
let &apos;s celebrate with some maple candy !  
here &apos;s your copy of the bill ,  we hope you enjoyed your stay .

i wish i could but i just found out that i have to be at work really early the next day ,  so i can &apos;t go ,  but ,  you know ,  take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want .  
hey !

oh ,  you &apos;re so wonderful .  
hey ,  i thought i &apos;d end up kissing charlie too ok ?  but surprise !  
ok .   
 hey honey !  i missed you today !  
yeah .   what d &apos;you wanna do tonight ?  
ok ,  trying to turn me on by making a mess ?  know your audience !  besides ,  tomorrow we &apos;re doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank .  
honey ,  we &apos;ve been trying to have a baby for over a year .  i think it &apos;s a good idea to find out if everything &apos;s ok .  just a few routine tests .  
what is the big deal ?  
it &apos;s not ok to do it in a doctor &apos;s office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a taco bell ?  
look ,  i don &apos;t wanna do this test either ,  but i really do think it &apos;s a good idea !  
 oh !  
mr .  bing ?   here you are !  you &apos;ll go into that room and deposit your specimen into the container .  
hey ,  honey ,  my test is down the hall ,  are you sure you &apos;re going to be ok ?  
oh my god !  !  
hey ,  we &apos;re probably fertile ,  let &apos;s go home !  
well ,  sid and i are trying again and we had trouble last time because apparently we .  .  .  
oh !  someone &apos;s a little cranky today cuz they have to do it in a cup !   oh !  they gave you the kiddy size  .  
this was fun !  but i &apos;ve got an invasive vaginal exam to get to !   
please .  .  .  go !   just let me know if you need a hand !  
oh !  sid is still in his room .  i don &apos;t allow porn at home so this is like a vacation for him .  so did you do it ?  did you make your deposit ?  
that &apos;s not the hard part honey !  the hard part is what comes next ,  i mean aren &apos;t you worried about the results ?  
oh !  well ,  you know what ?  it probably is .  
oh ,  chandler ,  look .  you and monica are meant to have children .  i am sure it &apos;s gonna be just fine .  
what ,  you can do it in the parking lot of a taco bell ,  but you can &apos;t do it at a doctor &apos;s office ?  
 it is not okay that i &apos;m aroused by this now .   
hey sweetie .  
with good news ?   of course it is not good news ,  you just said   &quot; doctor connelly just called &quot;  .  if it was good news you would have said   &quot; doctor connelly just called !   &quot;  but so what is it ?  is there a problem ,  uh ?  is there a problem with me or with you ?  
what ?  
oh .  .  .  what does that mean ?  
chandler ?  
 oh my god !  
i &apos;m sorry too .   
why would you ruin it ,  who was that hurtin &apos; ?  
oh ,  i so can &apos;t believe this !  my uterus is an inhospitable environment ?  i was trying so hard to be a good hostess !  
oh ,  i can &apos;t believe my sperm have low motility because ,  let me tell you ,  when i was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places !  !  
ok .  
 ok .  
tsz .  .  .  no !   .  
wait a minute ,  you guys .  oh ,  i wanna ask you something .  i - i i may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if i do ,  i &apos;d love for you guys to come and hear me .  
it &apos;s in barbados .  
bye ,  see ya .   
all right ,  so .  how did it go at the fertility clinic ?  
so - so what did the doctor say ?  
so you &apos;re ruling out surrogacy ?  
so ,  i don &apos;t have to learn what that means ?  
enough said ,  i &apos;m there for you man .  where is she ,  upstairs ?  
how do you feel about all this ?  
hi honey !  
 you too .  
thanks .  
yeah ,  i guess .  
 excuse me ?  
chandler ,  this is crazy !  what did you even say to him !   &quot; come up ,  meet my wife !  give us your sperm &quot;  !  
chandler !  
i &apos;m not going to be a part of this !  you can &apos;t just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor !  
uh !  
oh !  i &apos;m gonna go wash up first .   thanks !  
ok ,  there &apos;s enthusiastic and there &apos;s just plain gay !  !  
i think he is fine !  it &apos;s just that we don &apos;t know anything real about him .  .  .  we should get more information .  
you guys have such a great place here .  
uhm .  .  .  no .  although i did have an uncle who voted for dukakis .  
ok .  i heard a joke today .  it &apos;s pretty funny .  .  .  
ravioli &apos;s delicious !  
yess !  !   
i &apos;m gonna take off now .  you &apos;re gonna let me go home ,  aren &apos;t you ?  
no ,  no ,  i should get home ,  i &apos;m kinda tired .  
no it &apos;s just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died .  i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .  
ok .   
does seem pretty perfect .  
 no .  
no ,  that &apos;s not it .  it &apos;s just that when we were asking him all those questions before ,  i just .  .  .  i just realized i don &apos;t care if he &apos;s the most perfect guy in the world .  .  .  he &apos;s not you .  
no ,  he &apos;s not .  and if i can &apos;t get pregnant with you ,  then i don &apos;t want to get pregnant by .  .  .  him or anyone else .  
yeah ,  i &apos;m sure .  
that is so sweet .  i love you .   
adoption .  
i think i feel ok about it .  actually i think i feel really good about it .  
so this is it ,  we &apos;re really gonna adopt ?  
 oh my god ,  we &apos;re gonna be parents !  
and it could be soon .  i mean ,  think about it 
wait ,  if we &apos;re lucky ,  and we &apos;re really really really quiet ,  we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking !   
 hey chandler .  
no you didn &apos;t .  
no you did .  
oh ,  thank you .   
do you have anything that would .  .  .  get us out of them ?  
 see ?  
really ,  it doesn &apos;t mean anything .  i mean ,  you know ,  monica refers to chandler as richard all the time !  
 well ,  phoebe &apos;s still pretty hung up on that mike ,  uh ?  
still you know ,  a girl calls you by your ex - boyfriend &apos;s name ,  that - that &apos;s not a good thing ,  right ?  
sorry ,  i just .  .  .  i wish there was something i could do ,  you know ?  well ,  you know phoebe .  .  .  
i &apos;m sorry ,  uh .  .  .  i just wish i could make her forget about mike already ,  you know .  .  .  why did phoebe and mike break up ?  
that &apos;s great !  that &apos;s great !  i - i &apos;ll propose to her !  
well ,  i was probably going to do it at some point .  
why not ?  it &apos;s brilliant !   goodbye mike ,  we &apos;ll see you at the wedding ,  fella !   well ,  we probably won &apos;t invite you to the wedding .  .  .   thank you ,  chandler .  sincerely .  
 how do you think i should propose ?  
wow !  that mike thing was interesting !  i don &apos;t know what &apos;s gonna happen with phoebe and david .  
ok ,  i &apos;m sensing that this is some kind of word play ,  because you are pink with barely controlled glee .  
what ?   why ?  
chandler ,  we have talked about this .  you are not supposed to give people advice !  now couldn &apos;t you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke ?  
they &apos;ve only been going out for a few weeks and phoebe is completely hung up on mike !  she &apos;ll say  &quot; no &quot;  ,  david &apos;s heart will be broken ,  it will be too hard for them to recover from and then phoebe will end up alone again .  
ok !  when i go places with high humidity ,  it gets a little extra body ,  ok ?  !  
so ,  ehm .  .  .  i &apos;m proposing to pheobe tonight .   
yeah ,  well ,  being a failed scientist doesn &apos;t pay quite as well as you might think .  that &apos;s uhm .  .  .  one seventieth of a karat .  and the clarity is uhm .  .  .  is quite poor .  
 nice !   
ok !  
see what happens when you give people advice ?  i hope you told him not to ?  
ross just read me his speech .  it &apos;s fantastic !  
if you want to check your email ,  just ask !   
it &apos;s not the time charlie .  
oh what ,  did someone outbid you for the teapot ?   oh !  secret teapot ?  
wha .  .  .  what do you mean ?   
what ,  oh my god .  what did you do ?  
why ,  why would you open it ?  
what did it say ?  
what .  .  .  what am i gonna do ?  my speech is gone ,  chandler !  
no !  i don &apos;t !  !  
yep !  i &apos;d like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career !  
yeah ,  well you should !  i mean ,  nude pictures of anna kournikova ?  i mean ,  she &apos;s never even won a major tournament !  
 well ,  i hope you &apos;re happy !  
phoebe is going to say  &quot; yes &quot;  to david .  see ,  that &apos;s what happens when you meddle in people &apos;s lives !  
no it &apos;s not ,  b &apos;cause she &apos;s still in love with mike !  
no ,  i called him .  it &apos;s not gonna happen .  
well ,  if you hadn &apos;t meddled to start with ,  i wouldn &apos;t have had to go in there and meddle myself .  now ,  no matter how much we meddle ,  we will never be able to un - meddle the thing that you meddled up  -  in the first place !  
i can &apos;t believe she &apos;s gonna say yes to david .  she &apos;s clearly in love with mike .  
oh my god ,  he &apos;s gonna do it now .  please ,  i cannot watch this ,  let &apos;s go .  
i have a ring .  
 open your drapes !  open your drapes !  
the sun is out !  
ok listen ,  you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs ,  and i &apos;ll get the magazines and the lotion .  
finally ,  factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered 
and that &apos;s just the herbivores .  i &apos;m not even gonna discuss the carnivores ,  their heads are already too big .  which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development .   
 ping pong ?   honey ,  they have ping pong !  let &apos;s play !  
 why not ?  
i &apos;m not always that bad !  
 i punched you .  .  .  ?  
so ,  we &apos;re just four losers .  .  .  super !  
mike ,  you don &apos;t know ,  you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing !  
oh ,  by the way .  .  .  i &apos;m awesome !  !  
hell ,  yeah !  
 one thousand .  .  .  
 no .  .  .   either of you girls got a quarter ?  
ah yeaaaah !  
 oh ,  yeah !   are you telling me you .  .  .  you &apos;re not even .  .  .  a little turned on by monica ,  right now ?   
and that &apos;s how it &apos;s done !   
that &apos;s what i &apos;m thinking .  
ok ,  so it &apos;s a tie again ,  41 to 41 .  
no ,  i have just to have two more points to beat him !  
i can &apos;t just walk away !  i &apos;ve put in four hours !  
look !  you knew this about me when you married me !  you agreed to take me in sickness and in health .  well ,  this is my sickness !  
 aww !   
i can &apos;t believe it !   i lost !  
what ?  
 honey ,  you don &apos;t have to do this .  
but .  .  .  you suck !

it &apos;s like watching porn !   
 oh my god .  that was so amazing !  when did you  hold on !  i almost forgot  loser !   when did you stop sucking ?  
why ?  
this is so great !  now we can enter into doubles tournaments !  
do you have anything that would .  .  .  get us out of them ?  
 see ?  
really ,  it doesn &apos;t mean anything .  i mean ,  you know ,  monica refers to chandler as richard all the time !  
 well ,  phoebe &apos;s still pretty hung up on that mike ,  uh ?

god ,  this adoption stuff is so overwhelming .  there &apos;s inter - country adoption ,  dependency adoption .  .  there are so many ways to go ,  and this is like the biggest decision of our lives .  
hey ,  have you seen frank jr .  ,   &apos;cause he &apos;s meeting me here with the triplets .  
we went through the same thing when we were adopting .  
so ,  a lot of malfunctioning wee - wees and hoo - hoos in this room ,  huh ?   
i know the process is frustrating ,  but it &apos;s so worth it .  adopting owen was the best thing that ever happened to us .  
that &apos;s great .   can i see the book ?   
can i adopt you ?   
yeah .  
you were ?  
huh ?

why ?  what did you do in the bathroom ?  
i &apos;ll go get him in a second .  by the way ,  you should know we haven &apos;t told him he &apos;s adopted yet .  
i &apos;m adopted ?  !  
he told me !  and he paid me 50 dollars not to tell .  
you told him he &apos;s adopted ?  
uhm ,  we just wanna give you a heads - up .  bill and colleen hate us .  
still ,  he had to find out sometime .  
yeah ,  but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them ?   
yeah .  it &apos;s actually our first official date 
naa ,  no .  this is the part i &apos;m actually good at .  
 it &apos;s ok !  
well ,  i .  .  .  i know exactly what i &apos;m gonna do !  
no ,  no no no no .  see .  each woman is different . you have to appreciate their uniqueness .  
no ,  i do six things !  first ,  i look deep in her eyes .  then ,  i kiss her .  next i take my hand and i softly graze her thigh .  
no !  not like that ,  no no .  no ,  like this .

 chandler gets pedicures !  
oh ,  i guess we could try that ,  but .  .  .  it seems so harsh !   have you ever done that ?  
ok ,  dont hold thy breath !   
yes ,  i was looking for monica .  
we werent picking up ,  its amanda !  
 
i went to that tanning place your wife suggested .  
oh !  and it gets worse !   
oh oh !  what is up with miss hawaiian tropic ?  
well ,  it was good .  .  until we got back to our apartment ,  and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and i kept slapping it away !  
 chandler ,  stop !  it is not going to pop open !  
we are not friends with phoebe anymore .  
ooh ,  that accident must have been terrible .  you look positively ghastly .  
i don &apos;t know .   
hi !  hey ,  listen ,  can we ask you a question ?  when you and monica first hooked up ,  was it weird going from friends to .  .  .  more than that ?

 because .  .  .  we may not be who she thinks we are but no - one will ever love that baby more than us .  
i mean ,  who knows how long it &apos;s gonna take for someone else to give us a baby ?  what if ,  what if no one ever picks us ?  
 please .  .  please ,  we are so close .  
 okay ,  right .   
 maybe she will .  uh !  why couldn &apos;t i have been a reverend ?  
hi !  
look ,  doctor !   look ,  before we sign anything we really have to talk .  .  .  we &apos;re not who you think we are .  
what ?  
so who are you ?  
i don &apos;t want to look at your file !  this is over .   
i &apos;ve nothing to say to you .   
why don &apos;t you ask the reverend to pray on it ?  
oh yeah .  i actually liked you guys .  but it doesn &apos;t matter ,  because what you did was wrong .   
but you did like us .  and you should .  my wife &apos;s an incredible woman .  she &apos;s loving and devoted and caring .  and don &apos;t tell her i said this but the woman &apos;s always right .  .  .  i love my wife more than anything in this world .  and i .  .  .  it kills me that i can &apos;t give her a baby .  .  .  i really want a kid .  and when that day finally comes ,  i &apos;ll learn how to be a good dad .  but my wife .  .  .  she &apos;s already there .  she &apos;s a mother .  .  .  without a baby .  .  .  please ?   
 sex !  
oh ,  i &apos;m sorry honey ,  you know ,  but when she said  &quot; sex &quot;  i wasn &apos;t thinking about  &quot; sex with you &quot;  !  
oh yeah ?  well ,  let &apos;s see .   ok ,  duck down .   
oh ,  hi chandler .  it &apos;s phoebe .  uhm .  .  .  i know that monica is working today so .  .  .   .  .  . i was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and rachel .  
 oh ,  well ,  it &apos;s a shame that you - that you miss the movie  &apos;cause we were gonna see ,  you know ,  either  &quot; liar ,  liar &quot;  or  &quot; betrayal &quot;  ,  or .  .  .   &quot; an affair to remember &quot;  .  
hey !  you smell like perfume and cigarettes .

 you son of a bitch !  
 ok ,  alright ,  you guys ,  you &apos;d better sit down ,  this is pretty big .  
and that &apos;s great for you guys ,  but we want a lawn and a swingset .  .  .  
 it &apos;s ok ,  because they have to get it out of their system ,  okay  ,  but you &apos;re going to realize ,  this is the only place ,  you wanna be .   
and about an hour ago ,  we made an offer .

okay ,  if joey does the ceremony ,  then we have to find someone else to walk phoebe down the isle .  
i &apos;ll .  .  .  
okay .   it &apos;s zero hour .  all teams execute on my count .   let &apos;s get this bad boy on the road .  
 i have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours .  
groomsman ,  groomsman ,  why are you just standing there ,  where is your bridesmaid ?   we &apos;ve got a broken arrow .  bridesmaid down !   oh ,  that &apos;s me .

oh wait ,  oh no .  wait .   
i don &apos;t care .  .  .  i &apos;ll be my something blue .

nice .  oh hey ,  what about ross ?  
oh !  
hey .  
i &apos;m making cookies for erica .  and oh ,  by the way ,  we have to leave for the airport soon ,  her plane comes in about an hour .  
well ,  because we want to get to know her better and she &apos;s never been to new york so she wants to see all the tourists &apos; spots .  .  .  you know ,  statue of liberty ,  empire state building .  .  .  
honey .  
everyone .  erica ,  baby !  
welcome to new york city !  or should i say  &quot; ghe deu flooff new york city &quot;  ?  
oh yeah ,  let &apos;s do that !  
oh ,  i &apos;m glad .  listen ,  i want to apologize about chandler ,  though .  i just did not see this coming .  
what is with you ?  
well ,  if there is anything else you wanna know .  .  .   
oh ,  sure .  yeah ,  well ,  he was my high school boyfriend .  captain of the football team ,  really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college .   
well ,  there is a chance it &apos;s another guy .  i mean ,  i have only ever been with two guys ,  but they sorta overlapped .  
no .  .  .  he killed his father with a shovel .   but other than that ,  he &apos;s a great guy .  
are you awake ?  
alright ,  we don &apos;t know that it &apos;s him .  i mean ,  it could be the football guy .  
alright ,  lets say that it is him ,  would we not want the baby ?  no !  would we treat him any differently ?  
how ?  
yeah ,  but maybe we &apos;re just over - reacting .  
 we had a good time .  by the way ,  i wanted to ask you something .  it would really mean a lot to me ,  if the baby was a boy ,  that you name him after my father ,  jiminy billy bob  
no !   you we &apos;re right ,  that was fun !  i &apos;m gonna go finish packing .  
nope ,  she doesn &apos;t have to ,  i found out who the father is .  
 no it &apos;s not .  
well ,  it turns out that erica didn &apos;t pay much attention in sex ed class ,  because the thing she did with that prison guy .  .  .  it &apos;d be pretty hard to make a baby that way .  
the thing we never do .  
oh !  yeah ,  this is fun ,  couples night .  
well ,  because every time we do ,  you make jokes about swinging and scare them away .  
oh ,  well ,  er ,  i already ate ,  but sure .  .  .  !   guess what happened at work today .  .  .  
uhm the .  .  .  the ministry .  .  .  of names .  .  .  bureau .  .  .

what ?  i get my own room ?  
that guy mark .  from bloomingdale &apos;s .  .  .  she thinks he &apos;s just being nice to her .  but i know he really wants to sleep with her .  
so what if he wants to sleep with her ?  i mean ,  she &apos;s single and he &apos;s cute .  
oh please !  yesterday on the subway ?  you couldn &apos;t stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time .  
should we send something ?  
he offered me one .  
previously on friends .  .  .  
so if you take this job you &apos;ll be moving to paris ?  
i mean ,  i &apos;ll fly back and forth ,  they &apos;ll fly you out .  .  .  anything we want .  
you okay with this ?  
talking to ross .  
how is that gonna happen ?  
hey phoebe .  hey ,  tell me what you think .  all right .  the house next door to the one that we &apos;re buying in westchester ?  just went on the market .  i wanna take a look at it ,  but chandler doesn &apos;t .  
but what if it is better than ours ?  should we at least look ?  
well ,  i think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a baskin robbins .  .  .  anyway .  .  .  hey ,  isn &apos;t joey &apos;s agent estelle leonard ?  
she died .  
yeah ,  last saturday .  wow !  she was the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic .   oh ,  wait a minute ,  i read the wrong one .  
joey &apos;s gonna be *so* upset .  
what if he reads it in the paper ?  
thanks .  
what a small world !  
oh ,  we go way back .  before monica made an honest man out of him ,  chandler used to be my little love muffin !   .  so ?  are you guys thinking of getting this house too ?  ooh !  are we gonna have a bidding war ?  i &apos;d better warn you ,  i &apos;m a toughie  
no ,  actually ,  we &apos;re buying the house next door .   
ooh ,  that decides it then .  i was on the fence .  but knowing that you two would be our neighbors ?  ah !  now we have to get it !   ellen ,  we &apos;re going to talk numbers .   
okay ,  the realtor said another couple made an offer .  maybe the janice &apos;s won &apos;t get it !  maybe the other couple will .  
 okay ,  okay ,   all right .  what if we got both houses ?  huh ?  we can turn this house into a guest house .  
okay ,  you come up with an idea .  
but we love our house .  
okay ,  but if we don &apos;t get this house ,  she &apos;s stil gonna show up wherever we go !  i mean ,  at least if she &apos;s here ,  it eliminates the element of suprise .  i mean ,  never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body .   
well .  .  .  i just talked to sid ,  we are definitely putting in an offer on the house .  .  .  a - a - and i &apos;ll bet we get it .  
all right ,  i got to run .  tell monica i say goodbye .  and .  .  .  i &apos;ll see you later ,  neighbor .   
oh ,  me too .  .  .   
huh ?  
oh .  .  .  my .  .  .  
chandler ,  what are you talking about ?  
i don &apos;t know what to say .  .  .  i mean ,  you know ,  obviously we have this .  .  .  heat between us .  
but i love my husband .  and i know you love your wife .  now ,  i don &apos;t think we should get this house now .  
chandler ,  one of us has got to be strong .
