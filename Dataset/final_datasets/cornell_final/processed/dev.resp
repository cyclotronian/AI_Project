<s> Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
<s> Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
<s> Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
<s> I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
<s> Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
<s> Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
<s> Expensive?
<s> Hi, Joey.
<s> It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
<s> After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
<s> I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
<s> I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
<s> God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
<s> I guess I'll never know, will I?
<s> Exactly my point
<s> Otherwise known as an orgy?
<s> So they tell me...
<s> North, actually.  How'd you   ?
<s> How many people go here?
<s> Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
<s> Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
<s> You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
<s> Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
<s> Dead at forty-one.
<s> No, I ' m not.
<s> You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
<s> How much?
<s> Fine, thirty.
<s> Fifty, and you've got your man.
<s> I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
<s> Are you lost?
<s> No fear.
<s> I didn't have a choice.
<s> Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
<s> Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
<s> You -- covered in my vomit.
<s> Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
<s> Then why'd you ask?
<s> I'm gettin' there
<s> You 're so --
<s> Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
<s> So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
<s> Hearsay.
<s> I hate peas.
<s> You know what I mean
<s> Why not?
<s> Because I like to torture you.
<s> Don ' t you even dare. . .
<s> Then tell them I had a seizure.
<s> I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
<s> Parts of it.
<s> Oh yeah.
<s> Yeah...
<s> With the teeth of your zipper?
<s> See you next week!
<s> Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
<s> Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
<s> Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
<s> They tried... but I didn't let them.
<s> Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
<s> If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
<s> Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
<s> Chief says...
<s> The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
<s> I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
<s> Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
<s> If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
<s> You'll always be older than me, Father.
<s> A woman?
<s> If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
<s> He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
<s> Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
<s> He must be replaced.
<s> Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
<s> You bring the cigarettes?
<s> What about Oleg?
<s> No.  No way.
<s> Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
<s> What else do you need?
<s> Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
<s> So...the station is empty?
<s> I'm just trying to find out who you are.
<s> In the kitchen.
<s> Daphne, I...
<s> No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
<s> I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
<s> Okay.  But not water sports.
<s> Takin' a bath.
<s> I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
<s> Describe him.
<s> Watch the news?
<s> Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
<s> Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
<s> This has nothing to do with your fire.
<s> My point exactly.
<s> You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
<s> Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
<s> Then do it, asshole.
<s> He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
<s> I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
<s> Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...
<s> Answer the phone.
<s> That's good.
<s> Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
<s> My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?
<s> I am butcher.
<s> Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
<s> My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
<s> Where's Czech girl?
<s> Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
<s> I have five-hundred dollars.
<s> New York's finest.  This is his case.
<s> Yes.  Both.
<s> Okay.
<s> A job?
<s> You want the tape?  There it is!
<s> Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
<s> A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
<s> Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
<s> I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
<s> Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
<s> Yeah?
<s> How long they been livin' here?
<s> What the hell happened?
<s> And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
<s> What's up?
<s> It's possible.
<s> That seems very unlikely.
<s> Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
<s> But not completely inconceivable?
<s> Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
<s> No.
<s> I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
<s> I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
<s> Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
<s> I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
<s> Well, what is it?
<s> Thank you.
<s> I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
<s> I'll bet it's a fortune.
<s> How is gregor?
<s> I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
<s> You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
<s> Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
<s> Thank you very much, Hal.
<s> It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
<s> Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
<s> No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
<s> You got a real big mouth, convict.
<s> I ain't tired yet.
<s> Yeah, dummy.  Money.
<s> Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
<s> Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
<s> Goodbye.
<s> I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...
<s> You're done.  End of story.
<s> I'm helpin' you, huh?
<s> You have a good time?
<s> Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
<s> Jesus.
<s> In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
<s> Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
<s> I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
<s> What about Ganz?
<s> Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
<s> Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
<s> I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
<s> Luther's on the move...
<s> Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
<s> Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
<s> Partnership?
<s> I lost them, that's what happened.
<s> Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
<s> Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
<s> This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
<s> What'd you do?
<s> You sure you want me to?
<s> Yeah, one of my favorites.
<s> Jack, are you okay?
<s> I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
<s> Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
<s> I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.
<s> Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
<s> Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
<s> Tell me.
<s> Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
<s> I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
<s> This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
<s> I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
<s> Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
<s> When is she not in trouble?
<s> One more reason to shoot first eh?
<s> I didn't know your size.
<s> Who?
<s> Don't exist bud.
<s> How do I look?
<s> When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
<s> You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
<s> I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
<s> Yes ma..
<s> Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
<s> I don't think this is a good time...
<s> Three of us will never fit in there!
<s> I suppose that means "Hi" ?
<s> Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
<s> All 900.
<s> The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
<s> I'm so tired...
<s> You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
<s> Because...
<s> Actually only one cell survived..
<s> Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
<s> Wonderful!
<s> It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
<s> Recommendations.
<s> No... not at all.  Where are you?
<s> We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
<s> Honey, I'm not, please...
<s> I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...
<s> I don't know.  I'm sorry...
<s> Dino...
<s> Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
<s> I'll consider it.
<s> I'd rather you didn't.
<s> Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
<s> Machine's in?
<s> Move it, dirtbag... !
<s> I'm not so sure about this.
<s> You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
<s> I know what you did.
<s> Fuck you!
<s> Yeah.
<s> Something like that.
<s> Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!
<s> You enjoy it?
<s> Show me.
<s> That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
<s> Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Yeah... guess so.
<s> From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
<s> What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
<s> I don't know, where are yours?
<s> So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
<s> See ya.
<s> I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
<s> I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
<s> I'll do whatever I can to help.
<s> I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
<s> The checks were for odd amounts...
<s> Okay, I follow you so far...
<s> Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
<s> Yes, but...
<s> I don't know.
<s> It got to be too much for him.
<s> Okay.
<s> What?
<s> You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?
<s> Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
<s> It was bad.
<s> I can't find him.
<s> You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
<s> She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
<s> You're not taking my baby!
<s> Huh?
<s> He's inside you, where he hides.
<s> No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
<s> To take a picture.
<s> Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back.  Make them understand.
<s> Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
<s> They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
<s> That's the only reason you're alive...
<s> Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
<s> I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today.  Could we interest you in someone else?
<s> Nobody thinks that.
<s> Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
<s> That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
<s> Next life.  Oh, what's that?
<s> I don't believe this... All that gore you paint in the comics and you're squeamish?
<s> I want to talk about the baby.
<s> You're really a mixed-up oddball, aren't you?
<s> Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
<s> I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
<s> Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
<s> You know - it <u>is</u>?
<s> What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
<s> What???
<s> Radiation level...constantly rising...
<s> <u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
<s> What direction does the system indicate?
<s> There's got to be an explanation!
<s> Your friend was to remain where he was!
<s> Toward the Pole!
<s> This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
<s> Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
<s> About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
<s> What is the Northcountry Development Association?
<s> You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
<s> Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
<s> Shit! What are we gonna do?
<s> Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
<s> Hmm.
<s> LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
<s> Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 
<s> Piece of fucking cake.
<s> In the chest.
<s> What blood?
<s> What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
<s> No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
<s> See, I knew you'd be mad.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> What are you sorry for?
<s> His son-in-law damn near killed me.
<s> So?
<s> What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
<s> No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
<s> You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
<s> From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
<s> Yeah. I mean that.
<s> There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
<s> The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
<s> The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
<s> There's a furnace.
<s> I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
<s> Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
<s> Where... how'd you hear that?
<s> A lesson in work and its rewards. You'll thank me for this one day.  Sally, turn off that TV!
<s> Bang!
<s> You think Jack shot him?
<s> Who?
<s> Yeah, I guess.
<s> I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
<s> No thanks. I don't drink.
<s> What about her?
<s> Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
<s> Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
<s> You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
<s> I know, Mom.  It was great... really.
<s> Alice... I...
<s> Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
<s> Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
<s> You read my mind.
<s> I'm doing what I can.
<s> We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
<s> This doesn't make sense.
<s> An exercise in futility. Send the Nimitz back in.
<s> We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
<s> Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
<s> Because it is my duty.
<s> Roger.
<s> Sir, this plane carries the President of the United States.
<s> Dead.
<s> No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe.  The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. Call the White House.
<s> Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
<s> Tower, here.
<s> A dubious distinction, no?
<s> No.
<s> Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
<s> Gravity.
<s> We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
<s> Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
<s> She's a big girl.  She understands.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
<s> White House Situation room.
<s> Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
<s> But...
<s> Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
<s> Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
<s> I might still have a few chips left.
<s> Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> They better. Fuel's almost gone.
<s> You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.
<s> Ask Simon.
<s> Not now, Elaine.
<s> That was very well put, Ted.
<s> I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
<s> That's right -- premature ejection.
<s> You can do it from up here, Captain.
<s> Scraps.
<s> How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
<s> Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
<s> I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
<s> Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
<s> Thank you. Cream?
<s> No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
<s> Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
<s> Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
<s> Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
<s> Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
<s> And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."
<s> I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
<s> Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
<s> Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
<s> Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
<s> I love you, Elaine.
<s> Headquarters!? What is it?
<s> And a little ice.
<s> All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner.
<s> I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
<s> ...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
<s> Okay, this is one of my favorites.
<s> Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
<s> Thank you.
<s> This is becoming a serious breach of security.
<s> It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
<s> Here?
<s> There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
<s> Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?
<s> And still it fits?
<s> But I-- .
<s> Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
<s> Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
<s> George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
<s> Nothing.
<s> No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
<s> ... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
<s> Harcourt was the brain who brought it all together.
<s> There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
<s> Do what?!  George-- ?!
<s> We can't let him get away.
<s> Who else can I ask around here?
<s> I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
<s> Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it.
<s> Sure.  Just a minute.
<s> The human?
<s> Lucky nothing.  I had to empty my damn gun into him.
<s> Yeah, I'll bet.
<s> Departmental policy.
<s> Well, thanks, I --
<s> Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
<s> Hear me out...
<s> No!  The answer is no.  Now please go.  I'm sorry.  Just go, would you.
<s> Bullshit!
<s> It's insured.
<s> The structure seems intact.  They have power.
<s> I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
<s> Do it!
<s> Let's get these things lit.
<s> On my way.
<s> Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.
<s> Stand back.
<s> The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
<s> Seal the door.
<s> Terrible.
<s> No.. I've slept enough.
<s> What about me?
<s> Why do they tell little kids that?
<s> Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
<s> You mean dead.
<s> I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
<s> Look!
<s> Certainly!
<s> Indeed.
<s> No.
<s> Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
<s> You were sublime.
<s> Sir -
<s> Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
<s> Ui-vol-i-tub!
<s> Oh, leave me alone.
<s> Oh yes? You always know everything.
<s> Well, don't do that again!
<s> Stanzi!
<s> Wolfi! Your father is dead.
<s> Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
<s> Madame. How can I help you?
<s> No, sir. This is my own idea.
<s> He needs me, ma'am.
<s> He asked me to stay.
<s> You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
<s> So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
<s> Gertrude!
<s> Gertrude!
<s> Who was your teacher?
<s> Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
<s> Yes?
<s> Really?
<s> No, no, please! It is not a holy relic.  You know we have met already? In this very room. Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old.  He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no?
<s> Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto!
<s> Thank you, Sire!
<s> Yes, Sire.
<s> Well, yes, I admit it is.
<s> How is your financial situation?
<s> That's not what I hear.
<s> This is just a game, Papa.
<s> But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
<s> I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
<s> Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'
<s> Good morning, sir.
<s> Yes, thank you, sir.
<s> You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
<s> I don't know. He has pains.
<s> Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
<s> Sublime! Utterly sublime!
<s> Yes, well, it's all good fun.
<s> German!
<s> No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
<s> Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction?
<s> If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
<s> Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
<s> Did you like it, then?
<s> It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
<s> So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
<s> Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
<s> Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
<s> Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
<s> Taking out what you should never have put in.
<s> What is what?
<s> Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.
<s> Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
<s> You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
<s> Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
<s> I regret it is not too familiar.
<s> You cannot say that!
<s> What? Who the devil are you?
<s> Oh, I'm tender enough for you, my boy. I'm tender enough for you.
<s> Bene.
<s> Yes, Doctor?
<s> Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
<s> He's fine. We'll come right over.
<s> I dream of death mostly.
<s> It's okay. I want to talk to you.
<s> Twenty-eight.
<s> A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
<s> Now I'm embarrassed.
<s> Lovely.
<s> Yes?
<s> Of course.
<s> Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
<s> Yeah, I do, but go to work.
<s> A doper werewolf.
<s> David, let's go now.
<s> Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
<s> That's very funny, that is.
<s> You could have told them!
<s> Alex?
<s> What are you going to see?
<s> Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
<s> You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
<s> Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.
<s> In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
<s> We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
<s> You ask them.
<s> I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
<s> I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
<s> Plan?
<s> A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.
<s> What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
<s> Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
<s> We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.
<s> No.
<s> Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?
<s> How much?
<s> It was more than that last week.
<s> Here's twenty-five thousand.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
<s> I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
<s> Not yet, Mr. Clark.
<s> Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
<s> The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
<s> Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
<s> I'm sorry, Dude, but—I—
<s> But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
<s> All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?
<s> You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
<s> Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
<s> Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
<s> Well, you can. You always could.
<s> Yes, yes, it does. What are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
<s> I've loved you ever since I can remember, long before you married Tom Dickson.
<s> Good for you. Come on.
<s> Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
<s> I'm listening.
<s> That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
<s> Of course, let them in! You're late now.
<s> Yes.
<s> You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn—
<s> Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
<s> In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .
<s> Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?
<s> Directors, eh? Long faces?
<s> Mr. Sampson . . .
<s> Yes?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> I can't tell you.
<s> Gee, thanks, Mr. Dickson—
<s> Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night?
<s> Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
<s> I'm afraid he's been stalling.
<s> He says he can't get away in the daytime.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Is that busy husband of mine busy?
<s> Oh, is that so?
<s> I tell you, I saw them!
<s> Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that—
<s> Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!
<s> Yes, why?
<s> Now, let me see - a half hour after the Dooley sisters - and the Dooley sisters never get home until after—
<s> I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
<s> Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
<s> Jim Younger, I told you--
<s> The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
<s> Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
<s> WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
<s> ... Will Perry ...
<s> If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
<s> You'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend, cousin.  Cole Younger's going to make everybody rich!
<s> Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
<s> Pass me some whisky.
<s> Missed you too, cousin.
<s> Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
<s> Which one, right or left?
<s> Get buckets!
<s> The District Marshall
<s> Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
<s> Ho-yah!
<s> Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The railroad men come through, offering to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason?
<s> Mm-hmm.
<s> Maybe, maybe...
<s> Your Zee? Hmm.  "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."
<s> Heard of him.
<s> And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
<s> I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.
<s> Maybe it started out that way. But now...
<s> No, I --
<s> I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
<s> They're making him a hero now.
<s> Everything but the boring parts.
<s> No! I mean, of course not. No.
<s> What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
<s> What?
<s> Unfair. You are completely unfair.
<s> Me neither.
<s> You are a hell of a woman.
<s> Last February?
<s> Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
<s> Fair enough.
<s> You don't think God'll mind, do you?
<s> I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
<s> Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
<s> I swear.
<s> You do that.
<s> I'm doing you folks a favor --
<s> Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
<s> I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
<s> We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
<s> It is a nice piece of writing.
<s> Stop it. I'm...
<s> Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
<s> Courtney? Dinner?
<s> The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
<s> Is that Donald Trump's car?
<s> Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip –  to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
<s> Yes, Courtney?
<s> Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
<s> It's not that nice.
<s> Do...what.
<s> Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
<s> No. I'm not. Why should I ?
<s> I'm just leaving.
<s> Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
<s> I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
<s> Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
<s> No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.
<s> But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
<s> No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
<s> It looks that way, doesn't it?
<s> Calm down. Let's do it anyway
<s> Leaving what?
<s> Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
<s> Detective Donald KIMBALL?
<s> Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.
<s> Oh no. I have no plans.
<s> Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
<s> I'm on a diet. But thank you.
<s> Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
<s> Who's Ted Bundy?
<s> Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?
<s> Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
<s> What are I doing?
<s> What?
<s> Hello 
<s> Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
<s> Why would I?
<s> No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
<s> You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
<s> No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
<s> The disappearance of Paul Owen.
<s> Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
<s> Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
<s> He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
<s> Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places.
<s> We were both seven in 1969.
<s> Oh.
<s> Don.
<s> 0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
<s> Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
<s> Let's see...  That you were with-
<s> Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
<s> I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
<s> But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
<s> I'm hungry
<s> What am I gonna do?
<s> Al.
<s> You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
<s> Oh well, you know.
<s> We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
<s> Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
<s> 'Gonna wait outside.
<s> Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
<s> We're not gonna let it.
<s> You're right. It's -- a working relationship. Don't know what I was expecting.
<s> Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.
<s> You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
<s> ...Why?
<s> I remember.
<s> It's gonna get cold.
<s> Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
<s> I am. I am, sir.
<s> It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
<s> No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
<s> Is it your dish?
<s> I think they call him the "Houseman." 'Cause "guard" sounds too weird.
<s> ...Do I?
<s> Maybe I'm going too fast.
<s> I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
<s> Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --
<s> Wait... He knows.
<s> Just do it.
<s> Got out of my other commitment.
<s> Where we going?
<s> You know my name.
<s> I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
<s> No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
<s> She saved my life.
<s> They'd frame him.
<s> They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."
<s> Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
<s> Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!
<s> A what?
<s> Before they kill somebody else, too.
<s> I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally?
<s> Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
<s> Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
<s> She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
<s> What?
<s> Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!
<s> What?!
<s> Jesus, Teddy.
<s> Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
<s> Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --
<s> You may.
<s> I'd rather talk about Number Two.
<s> Is it about my teeth?
<s> Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup.
<s> Oh, and Austin...
<s> Thank you, Exposition.
<s> Right away, Exposition.
<s> Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
<s> What's the other?
<s> What?
<s> Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
<s> Yes, Basil?
<s> Yes Basil?
<s> Hey, Mick!
<s> Well, you can't always get what you want.
<s> Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
<s> No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
<s> Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
<s> Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
<s> Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
<s> Here, use mine.
<s> Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
<s> Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now.
<s> Indeed.
<s> Danger's my middle name.
<s> I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
<s> Is it one of ours?
<s> What are you saying, son?
<s> Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
<s> And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth!
<s> Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
<s> They're mutated sea bass.
<s> Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
<s> Great.
<s> You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
<s> I don't wanna take over the family business.
<s> No, he's really evil.
<s> You don't say. How real does it feel?
<s> No need. I'll call again.
<s> ... power ...
<s> Really -- what happened in 1922?
<s> Ropes?
<s> After the cold war ...
<s> You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
<s> How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
<s> And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
<s> And just what is the game?
<s> Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
<s> Do you really think so?
<s> They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
<s> An eccentric recluse?
<s> You should be dead.  How do you feel?
<s> Did he say who?
<s> But if someone miniaturized the process...
<s> Have I trespassed on a male prerogative?  We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ...
<s> Barely.
<s> No trouble.
<s> Always.  Except ...
<s> Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
<s> Not quite.
<s> You're saying I have no choice.
<s> Decontamination -- ?
<s> Getting to what?
<s> I fail to see --
<s> Well, I can't possibly go like this.
<s> How did you guess?
<s> Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
<s> Guilty until proven innocent?
<s> You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.
<s> I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.
<s> Both, actually.
<s> Perish the thought.
<s> Did I? My mistake.
<s> Check out the other guy's buns.
<s> You're kidding.
<s> Chulo, one thing at a time.
<s> Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
<s> Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
<s> What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
<s> I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
<s> He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
<s> Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
<s> She's mine!
<s> Yes, sir, I am.
<s> Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
<s> Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
<s> I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
<s> Gonna get married...
<s> Your mother's not dead.
<s> You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
<s> Great, Mom.
<s> Quiet, Mother.
<s> I hope those guys are all right.
<s> All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
<s> I'll take some.
<s> All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after "Falcon Crest."
<s> No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
<s> Ha, ha, ha.
<s> This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
<s> I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
<s> Rick!
<s> If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
<s> Very.
<s> Who?
<s> Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
<s> Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
<s> I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
<s> Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
<s> We're gonna be okay, man...
<s> -- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
<s> There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.
<s> My Lt. might have something to say about that.
<s> Just come down, John. Just --
<s> Who asked you?
<s> It works.
<s> Yeah? What about Laura --
<s> Hey! You don't know me --
<s> -- Never mind.
<s> You got a problem with drilling, probie?
<s> Roll the hose.
<s> Thanks for the insight.
<s> Just leave me alone, okay?
<s> Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
<s> He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
<s> Just... Just wanted to say hello...
<s> We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
<s> Got anything to drink in there?
<s> Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
<s> -- I work for the city.
<s> Who's doing this?
<s> What?
<s> -- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
<s> -- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
<s> "During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
<s> I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.
<s> Fire.
<s> Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.
<s> How ya feeling?
<s> I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
<s> You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
<s> There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
<s> Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
<s> Management were pin heads.
<s> Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
<s> He's got piano lessons.
<s> He's going to be a fireman.
<s> The great communicator.
<s> You treated me like shit.
<s> Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
<s> In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
<s> What the hell was it doing in the fire?
<s> Did he tell you how we finally met?
<s> Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow. You're depriving our famous young friend here...
<s> And old ladies?
<s> And the world -- the whole world.
<s> Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.
<s> Investigator Rimgale.
<s> Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
<s> Just catch the son of a bitch.
<s> Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant...
<s> I was gonna bring it back myself.
<s> What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
<s> Why do I dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death? And why have I never forgotten that if she, then I --
<s> What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
<s> I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.
<s> How 'bout...
<s> I'm on it.
<s> Yo Black, you looking for trouble.
<s> What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
<s> Must be the pressure.
<s> What are you talkin' about?
<s> Damn skippy.
<s> You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
<s> We might need some mo' money behind this.
<s> I'm tired of waiting.
<s> Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?
<s> EUREKA!!
<s> No costume.  No blackface.
<s> So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
<s> I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
<s> And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
<s> This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."
<s> I don't know about that plantation angle.
<s> We think so.
<s> I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
<s> I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
<s> Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.
<s> Is that so?
<s> Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
<s> Manray better not be bleeding to death.  I need him.  After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours.
<s> The pleasure is mine.
<s> This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
<s> I don't want to hear it.
<s> The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
<s> No.
<s> Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
<s> Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
<s> A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
<s> Oh her.
<s> She hates dem.
<s> ...no, she didn't...
<s> ...I heard different, thought that was...
<s> So when are you comin' to pick us up?
<s> You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
<s> Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper.
<s> I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
<s> Never read a book in my whole life.
<s> After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
<s> You can go now.
<s> What is your uncle's name?
<s> How do you do, sir?
<s> Only a very little, as soldiers do.
<s> Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
<s> He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
<s> Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
<s> Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
<s> Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
<s> You are going to drive to the frontier.
<s> Your honor must lower his voice.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Certain?
<s> On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
<s> That is a trifle strong.
<s> It is my only object.
<s> Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
<s> O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!
<s> All right, five hundred guineas.
<s> In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
<s> Good night, my little darling.
<s> Yes, papa.
<s> The milkmaid's daughter?
<s> Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
<s> I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?
<s> Black-eyed Sczortarska.
<s> You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
<s> Fine.
<s> Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
<s> We found him like this...
<s> Shut up.  West's dead.
<s> We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
<s> I'm serious --
<s> Do what?
<s> Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
<s> So did we. Why didn't you come?
<s> West's. Any kindling for afire?
<s> Just look. Little pocket.
<s> Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.
<s> From up close or far away?
<s> They?
<s> What don't you know?
<s> How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
<s> No. I said Dunbar.
<s> Because I was standing next to him.
<s> I didn't --
<s> Maybe he...
<s> Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
<s> That's preposterous --
<s> You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
<s> Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
<s> You and the Colonel go back.
<s> See, Ray, this is what we call "good cop, bad cop". She shouts, I stand up for you, you're grateful, a bond of trust is established.
<s> Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.
<s> Best time for banal chit-chat.
<s> I lost a bet.
<s> Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.
<s> I plan to grow on you.
<s> So noted.
<s> Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight.
<s> I lied. Wait for it...
<s> Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --
<s> That bugs you too?
<s> You mean the falsely accused?
<s> Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
<s> Right back where we started.
<s> Hardy, for Chrissakes --
<s> Seven.
<s> Tough.
<s> There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
<s> Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
<s> So you took off your shirt?
<s> Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone.
<s> Blame the nigger, then, huh? Someone turns up dead, you just look for the darkest face in the crowd --
<s> Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
<s> Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?
<s> We're not going anywhere.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Sir, yes, sir!
<s> Sir, yes, sir!
<s> Sir, yes, sir!
<s> Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
<s> Edward Bloom.
<s> Thirty years. Maybe more.
<s> A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
<s> You're pretty good at arithmetic.
<s> I can get it. I can just...
<s> That's terrible.
<s> I never knew.
<s> I can.
<s> Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
<s> Did you do any of that?
<s> There's a lot you don't know about me.
<s> Can we talk?
<s> What?
<s> Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...
<s> You say...
<s> You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
<s> I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
<s> I'm robbing this place.
<s> My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
<s> Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
<s> I'll help you.
<s> Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
<s> Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
<s> Yes. But that's a different...
<s> No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
<s> Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
<s> Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
<s> Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
<s> The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
<s> We'll stop then.
<s> You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
<s> Leave him!
<s> Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
<s> Uh. Do you like England?
<s> "I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.
<s> I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
<s> Sorry?
<s> You don't understand anything.
<s> It's makes it easier. Okay.
<s> Well as it turns out I did.
<s> You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
<s> What? No you're not..
<s> I said I don't have any.
<s> If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
<s> He will come back.
<s> You don't want to talk about it.
<s> Okay we won't talk about it.
<s> So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
<s> Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?
<s> Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
<s> Thank Christ for that.
<s> Not really. Maybe a little.
<s> What?
<s> She's dead.
<s> I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.
<s> Except for Small Eyes.
<s> Just wanted to see.
<s> This gonna get you in trouble?
<s> Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
<s> Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live shit. Like a wake up in here, now.
<s> You seen my snake-skin shoes?
<s> These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
<s> She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
<s> That's not right, really, cuz I...
<s> It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...
<s> I got others.
<s> I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
<s> It's so stupid. Says to me that he don't want nothin' to do with no military career. Says he wants to move. Open up an auto shop with his uncle up in Knoxville. I said, okay. How about now? Let's go.
<s> Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house.
<s> If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...
<s> Let go...
<s> Come on, gal...
<s> Why you got me chained?
<s> Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
<s> No ma'am.
<s> Or what?
<s> Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
<s> I CAN'T!
<s> Uh-uh.
<s> Uh-uh.
<s> We drinkin' buddies now?
<s> I'm here with you.
<s> Maybe I won't.
<s> He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
<s> I just know how you get. Good to know, them butterflies still in ya gut.
<s> Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat.
<s> I'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me.  I think folks carry on about heaven too much. Like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. And folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. I can go to Shoney's for that.
<s> Rae!
<s> Ronnie...
<s> Thought you had a man for that.
<s> Let go...
<s> Maybe we should do something?
<s> He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
<s> Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
<s> What'd she say?
<s> The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.
<s> That's what you said in the last three piss pots.
<s> I stole them.
<s> Only one way to find out... Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night.
<s> Good.  Very good...
<s> Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
<s> Yes...
<s> I need someone to translate for me.
<s> Not if it works.  I'll meet you at the train?
<s> Time, I've got plenty of.
<s> I'm amused.
<s> Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.
<s> He'll find out you took me.  I'm unprotected.  He'll kill us.  All of us.  You don't stand a chance.
<s> You certainly have a nice place here.
<s> Where?
<s> Then go get him.
<s> Had in mind something a little more radical.
<s> Why?
<s> Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are made to last -- as least they were. But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari. A high strung racing car -- built to win, not to last.
<s> I am?
<s> Well, no, not really.  There's Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor.
<s> Well, actually
<s> I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
<s> Thank you.
<s> We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
<s> What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
<s> Garbage man?
<s> Your customer, eh?
<s> Nexus designated Zhora:  incept June 13th 2017, athletic conditioning, highly competitive, special abilities in the entertainment field.
<s> I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
<s> No thanks.
<s> Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Huh huh.
<s> Sorry.
<s> You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.
<s> Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
<s> Ugh.
<s> Can you?  I couldn't.
<s> What do you want me to do?
<s> Dead.
<s> Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
<s> What?
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
<s> Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  Answer quickly as you can.
<s> I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
<s> Pris.
<s> I don't have one.
<s> We sure did.
<s> Just better.
<s> What's your problem?
<s> For how long?
<s> We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
<s> See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
<s> You don't?
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
<s> Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
<s> Why?!
<s> You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
<s> Sure.
<s> No dogs, huh? Okay.
<s> You said it would be easy!
<s> Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
<s> Um-hum.
<s> Yes!
<s> Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
<s> Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
<s> Good-bye!
<s> Not that one!
<s> Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
<s> You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
<s> Eve, I'm sorry.
<s> Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
<s> Goodnight!
<s> Well, you had better!!
<s> Yes, Eve?
<s> The front door is open.  Will you be back?
<s> Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.
<s> Merci!
<s> Yes. That's kind of how it was.
<s> Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi.
<s> Really?  Since when?
<s> 1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
<s> Sorry, that's the largest city.
<s> Yeah.
<s> He's a Windows guy then, huh?
<s> No.
<s> I LOVE THIS!!
<s> Okay. Thank you, my friends.
<s> How 'bout we check with Eve first?
<s> I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
<s> Bye, Adam!
<s> I guess living up here makes people look older.
<s> Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
<s> Up there!!
<s> You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> Yeah.
<s> "Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
<s> Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
<s> I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
<s> To you maybe.
<s> What?
<s> Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
<s> Hi.
<s> Would you excuse me?
<s> Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
<s> We do?
<s> --and we will--
<s> To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
<s> Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
<s> And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
<s> Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
<s> No.
<s> He's from Alaska.
<s> It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.
<s> Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
<s> To bed.
<s> He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
<s> He left with Sophie.
<s> Coward!
<s> Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
<s> The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
<s> Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
<s> I've seen a few.
<s> Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
<s> Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
<s> It must be great.
<s> Yes?
<s> Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
<s> Okay, I gotta tell you. I've discovered some things. Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
<s> I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
<s> Yes sir. I sure am.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
<s> Oh my God. Is her son OK?
<s> I wanted to see you.
<s> I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
<s> No.
<s> See my nipples?
<s> Yes, I like you.
<s> Yeah, hurry up though.
<s> Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
<s> Please, please stay.
<s> Whatiya mean?
<s> Yes.
<s> Frank would open you.
<s> Beeeee careful.
<s> Kiss me.
<s> Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
<s> You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
<s> If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
<s> I want you to stay with me.
<s> Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God.
<s> Who, Dorothy?
<s> Here's to Ben.
<s> Yes.
<s> This is it.
<s> Yeah. okay.
<s> Uh-uh.
<s> Terrible boring.
<s> That's too bad.
<s> There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
<s> Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.
<s> Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
<s> Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute.
<s> Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?
<s> You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
<s> Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
<s> I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
<s> Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
<s> Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
<s> Oh, okay, can I call?
<s> Look, it can wait till Sunday.
<s> Okay, okay. Bye.
<s> Actually. I've been in twice.
<s> Yes.
<s> That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
<s> Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
<s> Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
<s> I like that idea, that's a real good idea.
<s> No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
<s> Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
<s> Yeah, nice meetin' you.
<s> Sure, just a sec.  Excuse me.
<s> Go find one.
<s> Aye.
<s> Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit.  If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something.
<s> Got it.
<s> Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.
<s> What?
<s> Yes.
<s> Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.
<s> Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
<s> Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
<s> Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
<s> Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!
<s> Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?
<s> I know what the fuck he looks like!
<s> Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us.
<s> Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
<s> We... met them last night.
<s> Our mother can see through bags.
<s> Be careful.
<s> He got beat up by a girl.
<s> Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
<s> Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
<s> Just like on TV.
<s> Yes.
<s> It is your corrupt we claim.
<s> Do you know where that term comes from? In the early 1900's it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb.
<s> That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
<s> Rocco!
<s> You... oh god, why?
<s> It was... It was...
<s> He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.
<s> No way they could have seen it?
<s> Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
<s> Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?
<s> Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL! All the scumbags in the quiet city of Boston start dropping dead and you think it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police doing my thinking for me, I will have a fucking tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad car and get me over there. I want the crime scene photos and any witness statements. NOW!
<s> Hallelujah, Jaffar.
<s> I'll be back at 9:00.
<s> Hey Murph.
<s> I'm fuckin' fine.  Catch you on the flip side.
<s> Y'know it is, a bit.
<s> Well, I'm sold.
<s> You feel?
<s> Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
<s> Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
<s> Thank you, Father, thank you.  Whatever. Goodbye, amen.
<s> Yeah boss?
<s> Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
<s> Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.
<s> Fuck you Vincenzo.
<s> Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
<s> As part of his plan. I don't know why.
<s> The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
<s> She's an attractive older woman.
<s> You think we're going to be chased?
<s> Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
<s> No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
<s> Don't worry about it, Bob.
<s> This was in fourth grade.
<s> After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
<s> Maybe he just went to the store.
<s> This morning.
<s> You were asleep.
<s> He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
<s> If you say so.
<s> I don't think we can do that.
<s> How much?
<s> That's Applejack. You want to meet him?
<s> You really hit a guy with a bottle?
<s> What is it?
<s> Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
<s> Eleven fifteen.
<s> As a person?
<s> It's going back down.
<s> It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
<s> I'll see you there.
<s> I'll get him.
<s> I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
<s> Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're going to want: Kumar Banijamali.
<s> Hold it.
<s> Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
<s> Why'd you want to help us?
<s> Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
<s> Yeah. He said that.
<s> I hope not.
<s> Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
<s> My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
<s> His health isn't very good, you know. They take that into account.
<s> No.
<s> Like silk?
<s> Uh-uh.
<s> True.
<s> I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
<s> I warned you, Dignan.
<s> No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
<s> Maybe she turned.
<s> Let's just go.
<s> Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway.
<s> Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
<s> They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
<s> Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
<s> Watch me.
<s> His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
<s> That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
<s> Man, I don't want to go into this.
<s> I don't want to fight you, Dignan.
<s> Look. We want you on the job.
<s> I'm working on it.
<s> Hey, Jackson. How's it going?
<s> I'm trying.
<s> Social issues. Crime prevention.
<s> The basic grammatical rules of robbing.
<s> Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
<s> You Hoto?
<s> Mr. Henry?
<s> What?
<s> Pleasure to meet you, John.
<s> And the Landy woman?
<s> Never heard of it.
<s> I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
<s> Don't know.
<s> I'm sorry, Ward.
<s> And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
<s> No good options left?
<s> Lots of people...
<s> Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
<s> It's nothing. It's just a picture.
<s> I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
<s> Conklin.
<s> A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
<s> But it ends up the same.
<s> We pushed it. We got lazy.
<s> No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there... 
<s> What?
<s> But you found another choice.
<s> You do?
<s> Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
<s> Sounds like a threat.
<s> Who's going? Us?
<s> Here?
<s> Is there. Is all there.
<s> Me? Four years.
<s> And why is that?
<s> It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
<s> I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
<s> So?
<s> Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
<s> You've all sworn to Longshanks.
<s> He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.
<s> He was a modest man.
<s> He will. I know he will.
<s> So the Scots will have none of them, will they? My armorers have already made a thousand.
<s> You fancy him.
<s> No. One of us is enough.
<s> Shall I leave, M'lord?
<s> Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
<s> Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
<s> My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
<s> He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
<s> ...I wouldn't know.
<s> No English lord would trust an Irishman!
<s> I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
<s> Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
<s> How soon?...
<s> You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
<s> He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc?
<s> No, protecting her.
<s> Are you sure? Not even with my father?
<s> Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
<s> Where are my goddamn books?
<s> I thought you were a December baby.
<s> Like Ozzy.
<s> What the fuck are you doing?
<s> Huh?
<s> Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
<s> Those are your clothes, silly.
<s> As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?
<s> Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
<s> No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
<s> He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.
<s> Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.
<s> That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
<s> It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
<s> Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
<s> Who's to say you can't make things better?
<s> Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
<s> I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
<s> Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't...
<s> Thumper had a busy afternoon.
<s> Y... yes. I guess I did.
<s> Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
<s> No thanks, Carl.
<s> Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
<s> Suppose we do.
<s> And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
<s> Well, good luck. But be careful.  You know you're being shadowed?
<s> Occupied France?
<s> How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
<s> I will.
<s> In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
<s> Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
<s> -- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
<s> It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
<s> The stairs from the street.
<s> No.
<s> I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
<s> Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
<s> Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
<s> What for?
<s> My office.
<s> I said, ask your wife.
<s> We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
<s> Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
<s> Here it is.
<s> Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
<s> This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
<s> I slept very well.
<s> May we proceed with the business?
<s> Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
<s> Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
<s> You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
<s> I see what you mean.
<s> But I have no excuse to close it.
<s> Why? What's in Lisbon?
<s> What, again?
<s> Yeah? Have a brandy?
<s> -- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
<s> Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
<s> Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.
<s> You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo?
<s> It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
<s> Have you taken leave of your senses?
<s> Put that gun down.
<s> -- Sacha, call a cab.
<s> It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
<s> Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
<s> I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
<s> No.
<s> Then don't have a drink.
<s> Worse than Warsaw.
<s> Take it.
<s> Take it, damn it.
<s> Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the damn water.
<s> I'm putting it off.
<s> But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
<s> If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
<s> You are.
<s> He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him.
<s> You smell like formaldehyde.
<s> Let me guess, Russia came up?
<s> He's your cute thing.
<s> You have any children?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Great.  Really.
<s> And how was your Christmas?
<s> Under the circumstances your overall health is good.  Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.
<s> Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
<s> Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
<s> It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
<s> Don't you even think about it.
<s> Borrowed.  I borrowed it.
<s> The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
<s> What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
<s> We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.
<s> It's me.
<s> You should have smelled me.
<s> Time I had lots of.
<s> To life.
<s> Believe me I know.
<s> Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it.
<s> It claims to restore monthly regularity.
<s> I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
<s> He mentions Homer, too, you know.
<s> Good night, Daddy.
<s> Two.
<s> Burma!
<s> Sure... I'll see you around.
<s> I'm *never* bored! It's all very... different for me... here.
<s> When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone.  Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I...  ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.
<s> I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
<s> Ah-ha.  So what is that--a radio?
<s> You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
<s> I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
<s> I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
<s> How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
<s> He's leaving...
<s> Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
<s> She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
<s> Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
<s> Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
<s> Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
<s> What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
<s> You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!
<s> And I *love* her! There ain't nobody else gonna treat her as good as I do!  I wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her, Homer--you must know that.
<s> Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* business.  If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere.
<s> Right?
<s> You do it then.
<s> How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
<s> I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
<s> It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
<s> I don't know.  Just promise me one thing.
<s> Just promise me that, if there's a blizzard, you'll move into Wally's room until it's over.
<s> We heard that one already, Homer.
<s> Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
<s> No trouble.
<s> Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
<s> Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen...
<s> Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
<s> Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.
<s> You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
<s> You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
<s> You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
<s> On me. For the seat. Cheers.
<s> Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
<s> Big.Com. That Internet thing.
<s> You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer.
<s> No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.
<s> And these cops? What do they get?
<s> You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
<s> That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
<s> After you cut her loose.
<s> Guess so.
<s> Let's see... Let's suppose he gets to Customs and he gets caught. We get our money back, but then we have to deal with a criminal investigation. I don't much like that idea. Then again, let's suppose he actually gets through Customs. Now, that'll be something. We recover the money in cash and let the insurance cover the corporate fraud. We double our money.
<s> So what? We hide, right?
<s> Alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second. Is this the best thing to do?
<s> Let's go, Jake?
<s> So what? We just stay clear of him.
<s> Jake, I mean, come on --
<s> I told you, use less powder.
<s> And what about Big Al?
<s> Tonight. Just me.
<s> Eight A.M. flight.
<s> I can't do that.
<s> Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
<s> Yeah Well, Sobo's kid needs braces.
<s> Well, it certainly is a coincidence. Here of all places! How is Mrs. Lewis?
<s> LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
<s> Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
<s> Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.
<s> What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
<s> It's what I do. It's my job.
<s> I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
<s> Glenn talked you out of it.
<s> It's me. It's Jake. Listen... It's happening. Gordo's landing right now. Meet me at the Euclid... For your cut, I mean. It's... I want you to have it.
<s> Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
<s> Just mail it to the hospital.  Mr. King, please. It's regarding an accounting problem. Yes... Correct... I know where it is. That will be fine. Thank you.
<s> What do we need another Shill for?
<s> Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
<s> Do you have a ticket?
<s> Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
<s> Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
<s> What?
<s> No offense, but I've seen you fight. You gotta be kidding m-
<s> Eee Oott Auught!
<s> Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?
<s> I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
<s> It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic. Last year I had a tooth capped. The dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic.
<s> All men are cheats.
<s> You called the casino a cesspit.
<s> I don't know anything about it.
<s> How about five hundred.
<s> I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
<s> What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?
<s> I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
<s> Who was he?
<s> Do you have to swear all the time?
<s> What about a drink on the way home?
<s> Gambling's not about money.
<s> It's not that.
<s> All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him.
<s> Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that
<s> Don't let yourself down.
<s> So why did you come to my casino?
<s> And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
<s> Absolutely not.
<s> Wait a minute...
<s> I told you, all bets are off.
<s> Do you?
<s> The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
<s> Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
<s> Who...
<s> Turn left at the lights.
<s> You're talking about complicity.
<s> Rough life, Jack.
<s> I'll tell you later.
<s> What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
<s> I said good call.
<s> What for?
<s> How?
<s> No.
<s> Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?
<s> Well, there's the possibility of...
<s> Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
<s> Energy shielding positive function.
<s> Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.
<s> Armed.
<s> Thanks.
<s> I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
<s> And I saw that I was alone.
<s> Of course.
<s> Right!
<s> That is correct.
<s> Yes, Doolittle.
<s> Doolittle...
<s> What?
<s> Fred.
<s> I hereby name this star Fred.
<s> Out where?
<s> Ah, negative drop.
<s> Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
<s> Yes, Talby, what is it?
<s> Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up.
<s> Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
<s> I like to keep it professional, that's all.
<s> None of your business.
<s> Where?
<s> You mean until you showed up?
<s> I ain't mad at you...
<s> I got overhead...
<s> And for all his cattin' around, not much of a stick man either.
<s> Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
<s> Every week.
<s> Hello...
<s> But why can't we stay here?
<s> Are we in some kind of trouble?
<s> Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
<s> Can we go somewhere and talk?
<s> Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
<s> People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
<s> You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
<s> Bent?
<s> Yes on all counts.
<s> The other ones?
<s> You did go through my stuff.
<s> How well do you remember the lab?
<s> And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
<s> We're quoting Mom again.
<s> And you still think you can do something to change that.
<s> He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
<s> Oh?
<s> How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
<s> You're also a fool.
<s> Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
<s> My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?
<s> He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
<s> Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--
<s> Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
<s> I just don't go in with any expectations.
<s> You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
<s> You know what I'm saying.
<s> And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
<s> I actually know how this works.
<s> What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
<s> She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
<s> I know what I got, Max.  They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.
<s> I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
<s> Max--
<s> I'm the victim here.
<s> She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
<s> Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
<s> Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
<s> You don't.
<s> You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
<s> You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
<s> I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
<s> I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
<s> You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?
<s> Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.
<s> Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
<s> Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one.
<s> Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.
<s> What's in Sandusky?
<s> And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
<s> Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
<s> ...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
<s> ...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
<s> The easy way.
<s> Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
<s> Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.
<s> Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm.
<s> Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
<s> Go ahead, Jam.
<s> It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
<s> Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.
<s> You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.
<s> I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! Lord have mercy!!
<s> Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
<s> I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it.
<s> What?
<s> We won?!
<s> Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
<s> You heard me, nad breath. My time's precious and I think that's a reasonable price to pay for your sorry life.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
<s> Take it off. I want to see you.
<s> We went to a hotel.
<s> That's easy. Antiseptics.
<s> Wonder where we'll be then.
<s> I'm going home.
<s> And you'd never been there before?
<s> With, like, images?
<s> And what?
<s> Are you okay?
<s> Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
<s> No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
<s> When did you stop taking your medication?
<s> Fine. You know, Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.
<s> Do you get to meet Ed?
<s> A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
<s> A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that "Cellar Door" is the most beautiful.
<s> I think about... fucking a lot during school.
<s> I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
<s> No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
<s> Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
<s> Why?
<s> Where are we going?
<s> Where is he, Donald?
<s> Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
<s> What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
<s> You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
<s> Frank?
<s> You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
<s> He died, remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed.
<s> What else?
<s> Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
<s> Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.
<s> Raspberry.
<s> I stole four beers from my dad.
<s> Don't let that worry you, Annette!
<s> Oh God, I'm dead...
<s> Yeah, you betcha...
<s> Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
<s> Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
<s> Huh?
<s> Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes?
<s> Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons.  Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed.
<s> Here, have some.
<s> You could be quiet.
<s> My dress'll reek.
<s> Yeah.
<s> The important thing is that we have a winner...
<s> "U.S.A. is A-okay."
<s> Yah -- Gladys had me order that swan special made from Mexico  in case Becky won. I do a lotta business with those people. I always offer to pay 'em in tacos.  Whoo, they love that.
<s> A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.
<s> I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
<s> It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
<s> Uh, Gladys?
<s> Come on! Hankey here can't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse rat!
<s> I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
<s> What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!
<s> I'll have to enclose the check first.
<s> But you're my father -
<s> I wanna powder my nose...
<s> He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
<s> Yeh, he's only got one eye.
<s> Yankee Poodle.
<s> You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
<s> I don't know what's keeping me.  I should've been here a long time ago. Now how about my proposition?
<s> Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult somebody.
<s> You told it to me.
<s> I don't know about us, but I know he's-a got something...
<s> Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
<s> I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
<s> You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it.  Where's my secretary? 
<s> Well, why not say the least and get it over with?
<s> No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
<s> That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
<s> The king can do no wrong!
<s> Well no -- not exactly -- but --
<s> I didn't come here to be insulted.
<s> With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control -- 
<s> If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
<s> I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
<s> He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?
<s> ...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
<s> Yes?
<s> Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> I intend to.
<s> I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
<s> All you do is profit from another man's misery!
<s> Good morning, sir.
<s> Indeed!
<s> No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
<s> Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend?
<s> Yes, I think I can.
<s> Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.
<s> I am very pleased to meet you.
<s> Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
<s> It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh no, my friend...
<s> Say "Merrick".
<s> Thank you very much.
<s> I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
<s> Of course.
<s> You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
<s> I've heard.
<s> We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
<s> Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
<s> You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
<s> Oh... oh, I didn't know her very well...
<s> Who?
<s> I mean, you could have killed yourself.
<s> Goodbye, Aud...
<s> There is something I must ask the Gods...
<s> No... no...
<s> Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
<s> That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...
<s> REALLY?
<s> Yes?
<s> Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
<s> Shut up.
<s> Sh!
<s> Oh, get it over with.
<s> We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
<s> That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
<s> Just say something cheerful.
<s> What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
<s> DEATH!
<s> I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
<s> It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
<s> But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..
<s> The Age of Ragnarok ends...
<s> Well... I... I thought...
<s> YOU do it!
<s> We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!
<s> You went berserk...
<s> I must only let the red rage...
<s> I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
<s> Sh!
<s> No... he's not... not... there...
<s> I never do...
<s> No one.
<s> I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.
<s> Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
<s> I don't know any jokes about your name.
<s> I don't want to take you out of your way.
<s> You're not a stalker or anything, right?
<s> Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
<s> I know a man who needs a refill.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Thanks.
<s> No, not at all.
<s> Yes.
<s> You'll call me, right?
<s> I want to have a baby.
<s> It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!
<s> Would you get me another, Joely?
<s> No. Thanks.
<s> Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
<s> Yeah.
<s> I'd like to... take you out or something.
<s> Okay.
<s> It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
<s> I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
<s> Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
<s> Oh.
<s> Female.
<s> I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
<s> Joel, come here. Please.
<s> Make love?
<s> Well, you obviously don't know me.
<s> That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke.
<s> Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?
<s> Your dried cum.
<s> Hi.
<s> And what are you like? A wino?
<s> Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
<s> Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
<s> No. I just need some space, maybe.
<s> Hi.
<s> In a minute.
<s> I hope you get your work done.
<s> Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
<s> What?
<s> Do you swear you didn't know?
<s> I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
<s> Thanks, Stan.
<s> That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
<s> Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some.
<s> I have a family, Mary.
<s> December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.
<s> Did you try going through C-Gate?
<s> Jesus.
<s> Patrick, we need to focus.
<s> She was unconscious, Patrick.
<s> Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
<s> I know who you are.
<s> Save your breath for the climb.
<s> Easy come, easy go.
<s> How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
<s> Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
<s> Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
<s> FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
<s> How did this business get started, anyhow? Why are the birds nesting here?
<s> 'Drugged' is a stupid word.
<s> It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
<s> She always leaves town, you dummy. That doesn't mean anything. What about in bed? How does she like it in bed?
<s> I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
<s> A job for me?
<s> Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.
<s> Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
<s> Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
<s> You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
<s> Hold on, Coop...
<s> We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.
<s> No, he didn't.
<s> I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect!"
<s> No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers.
<s> His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.
<s> "Another man?" Who?
<s> A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. I have to go with them.
<s> The Lewis and Clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she's docked in bay four.
<s> It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.
<s> Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years.
<s> I don't know.
<s> What makes you think I'll miss?
<s> I'm not the Devil.
<s> Starck... Cooper...
<s> That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Starck...
<s> She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
<s> Let's go.
<s> Blow it up?
<s> No. I'll be right back.
<s> Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
<s> Not according to the computer.
<s> Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point A" here...  ...to "point B," here.  Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?
<s> We're losing atmosphere...
<s> Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
<s> Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
<s> Relax, it's casual.
<s> Is it safe?
<s> To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
<s> I already got it. Everything I want.
<s> Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
<s> Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
<s> Well maybe you should date him.
<s> Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
<s> 'Course not. Strictly business.
<s> Give me the god damn mirror!
<s> Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
<s> Ben! Ben!
<s> The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
<s> Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
<s> Please tell me you go silent too.
<s> Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
<s> Dude. That's my sister.
<s> At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
<s> No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
<s> It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
<s> Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
<s> That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not mine."
<s> Great minds think alike.
<s> Are you kidding?
<s> Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.
<s> I did. I did, Reed... but I wanted you to be that man.
<s> I'm sure I can come up with something.
<s> I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
<s> Raising the shields.
<s> Don't worry about it.
<s> If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
<s> Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?
<s> Totally.
<s> First door on your left!
<s> Where did you hear that?
<s> No.
<s> They were left over from the last shift.
<s> Okay, Dennis.
<s> Ugh.
<s> Get a ride with somebody.
<s> I don't know. It's getting pretty late...
<s> Come on...
<s> It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
<s> You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
<s> All right. Pay attention.
<s> I think I've got it. Once I get going, I'll be okay. But... how do I get started? I mean, I hardly know her.
<s> Damone. It's Mark.
<s> Okay. See ya.
<s> You're crazy. Those girls love me.
<s> Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
<s> Fascinating.
<s> They're fuckin' with us.
<s> All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
<s> You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
<s> Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
<s> What should I do?
<s> Should we buy a frame for that?
<s> Not since November.
<s> I think they're both virgins.
<s> I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.
<s> I don't know... I just don't feel right.
<s> That little prick.
<s> He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
<s> Yes.
<s> I don't know. I guess so.
<s> Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
<s> We keep them.
<s> My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime?
<s> Not at all.
<s> Two more Cokes.
<s> Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
<s> Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
<s> Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
<s> Crying? Why was she crying?
<s> Naw! Not a major.
<s> Jesus! Did I say that?
<s> We will. You Samoans are all the same. You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
<s> My heart!
<s> Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. 
<s> Why what?
<s> It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop.
<s> Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.
<s> There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
<s> It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.
<s> I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done.
<s> Right. Sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops.
<s> They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...
<s> ...and every one of them stacked naked...
<s> They were all veterans.
<s> We keep it quiet. It's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs. Not with the press around.
<s> Me?
<s> Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month.
<s> Of course, officer.
<s> Part of what?
<s> Yes! I'll help you all you need! I hate dope!
<s> He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
<s> We're going to get my little girl.
<s> But it's got teeth.
<s> Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
<s> It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
<s> Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday.
<s> Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
<s> Sure.
<s> What?
<s> Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
<s> Covered.
<s> They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.
<s> F-f-fuck you.
<s> You smell like ass!
<s> What the hell's going on here!?
<s> Get something on that.
<s> Am I too heavy for you?
<s> Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
<s> Nothing, just lookin'.
<s> YOU'LL HIT US!
<s> Wait God-dammit!
<s> Stop her!
<s> I'm fine, I really am.
<s> I think --
<s> Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
<s> I'm not lying.
<s> I said I'm not lying.
<s> But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
<s> That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
<s> I think it's time to take the gloves off.  Get me some reporters.  Particularly Louella Parsons!
<s> But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
<s> I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford.
<s> He's not here.
<s> Right now we have to be practical.
<s> In my eyes, officer.
<s> All square, Doc.
<s> I know you believe that.
<s> I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
<s> Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
<s> We'll get you home, Frances.
<s> ...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...
<s> No. Never.
<s> He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
<s> Be careful, Francie.
<s> What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Good.
<s> No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
<s> Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
<s> Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
<s> Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
<s> Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
<s> Enh.
<s> ...So you think I should go.
<s> I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
<s> What?
<s> Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
<s> Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
<s> Calm down, Frances.
<s> I took the early rounds.
<s> And?
<s> You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
<s> Whattaya think you're in now?
<s> Huh?
<s> I guess.
<s> Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
<s> Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
<s> I know. Don't tell anyone.
<s> Well... you're looking well.
<s> Who's writing this guy's lines?
<s> Who're you?
<s> You're Farmer? Oh... Well, look, they took your stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.
<s> Your big speech?
<s> I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
<s> I'll be back.
<s> I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
<s> Excuse me.
<s> Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
<s> Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
<s> All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.
<s> I'll have someone show you to your room.
<s> Sedate her.
<s> Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
<s> There is something I want.  A friend.
<s> I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
<s> She's not for you.
<s> So have I
<s> She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
<s> To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
<s> Your decision. For us.
<s> Why the change? What about your work?
<s> Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
<s> They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
<s> You're a comfort to me, Henry.
<s> He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
<s> I resent God's monopoly.
<s> So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this.  The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted.  How did it come to be in your possession?
<s> Victor, explain yourself.
<s> Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor.
<s> Lives are ephemeral. The knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on.
<s> It will be all right. I'll take care of you.
<s> I will protect you.
<s> Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push.
<s> You told her to sweep the courts.
<s> And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about children...
<s> I'll go take a look.
<s> Wet. I don't know.
<s> Don't burn that gorgeous body, or I'll scratch your eyes out...
<s> Oh, you...
<s> Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
<s> For sure.
<s> Whatever you make yourself.
<s> Ned!
<s> I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
<s> I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
<s> Mmmmmmmph.
<s> There you are dead wrong.
<s> Girls can't be cowboys.
<s> Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
<s> I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
<s> You've made a science out of coincidence.
<s> Another coincidence.
<s> Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
<s> Have you ever been there before?
<s> Stop? We're not going to actually stop at a motel, are we?
<s> They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.
<s> It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
<s> To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!
<s> Jacob.
<s> How do I know you'll keep your word?
<s> No, I didn't.
<s> You won't let him touch her?
<s> Pass.
<s> Forever together.
<s> You bet your sweet ass you are, and I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't got much time.
<s> Kate, Scott?
<s> Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.
<s> It's a flop house.
<s> No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.
<s> Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
<s> I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
<s> Sure.
<s> The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9.
<s> Yes.
<s> Later.
<s> Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
<s> Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
<s> Whatsamatter?
<s> Isn't there a law or something against retards serving food to the public?
<s> I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to "Benny's World of Blood."
<s> One... Two... Three.
<s> What am I supposed to do, Seth? He recognized us.
<s> No.
<s> There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
<s> Yes, Seth, I understand.
<s> Duly noted. Now, shut up.
<s> As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
<s> What?
<s> Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.
<s> Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
<s> Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
<s> It don't look together.
<s> Yeah, it's mine.
<s> Thank you, ensign.
<s> More than you'd guess.  It's just that we don't hold coffee klatches. If more then three of us get together at any one time, the guys think it's some kind of uprising.
<s> If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.
<s> Motherachrist...
<s> Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
<s> Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
<s> In face, I do:  Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same.
<s> 'Snot me.  It's him.
<s> Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...
<s> If you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! I want nuts to butts!
<s> I oughtta report you.
<s> Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts.  But I think the Chief knew that his way -- his world -- had come and gone.
<s> Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
<s> Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
<s> Is this my glory, sir?
<s> I saw an article...
<s> Whose orders were those?
<s> I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age.
<s> You got anybody, Wick?
<s> I don't know...
<s> I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!
<s> That's not right.
<s> I think you're the liar.
<s> Sure.  Just like your men do.
<s> Show us where you are, Chief.
<s> Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.
<s> Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file.
<s> You knew about us?
<s> The Navy?  They've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women's heads.  What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's co-ed?
<s> Shut up. How can you eat like that?
<s> It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
<s> You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
<s> No.
<s> It's good to see you, Nick.
<s> What?
<s> No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...
<s> Oh my God! They're coming!
<s> Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
<s> What?
<s> Not now. You got my bag?
<s> Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
<s> Me too.
<s> Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
<s> We know.
<s> Yeah, you're the worm guy.
<s> You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
<s> Thanks.
<s> This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.
<s> Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
<s> You were right.
<s> Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
<s> Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
<s> Uh uh! What did we talk about?
<s> Come with me. I'll explain on the way.
<s> I'm... I'm shot.
<s> ... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
<s> Like YOU know?
<s> I was staying in character.  "Egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
<s> I played Richard III...
<s> No, Jason, that's a wrap!  There's nothing to think about!
<s> You think you could do better "Laredo?"
<s> You have a better plan, Alex?
<s> Why didn't you stop at the market?
<s> All this from watching the.. historical records?
<s> FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE!
<s> Excuse me guys.
<s> It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
<s> Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
<s> Up.
<s> Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
<s> There is no weather in space.
<s> The enemy is matching velocity.
<s> You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
<s> I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
<s> Do I? DO I?  For all you know I'm just "CREWMAN #6"!  Okay, it's FLEEGMAN! Guy FLEEGMAN! There! Now I'm a whole person! I can't die! FLEEGMAN! THEY CAN'T KILL ME NOW, CAN THEY? CAN THEY?
<s> All right, let's all settle down.  If we're going to get through this we're going to have to exercise self control.
<s> Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
<s> BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31!
<s> Hey, YOU want to drive?
<s> We're doing episode 31?
<s> We made it. Commander, we made it.'
<s> You smiled at me.
<s> You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...
<s> Tell them? About...
<s> It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
<s> Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
<s> Jason..
<s> Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
<s> Why does this sound so familiar?
<s> It helps.
<s> Nothing. Hold please.
<s> No I don't. But I know somebody who does.
<s> Wait... Jason, Here!...
<s> Almost as much as he loves himself.
<s> That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead.
<s> Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
<s> Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
<s> I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
<s> Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew.
<s> It's the Tothian mine field left standing from the Great War of 12185.
<s> Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
<s> Jason? What about me? What do I do?
<s> Pedal to the metal...
<s> Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
<s> Tell Mrs. Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer.
<s> No, my lord.
<s> Delighted, sir.
<s> They go back home to keep their families alive, stay into the spring to plant.  Then, they start coming back to us.
<s> Congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions.
<s> But it's more than just that, am I right?
<s> It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
<s> These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.
<s> Detained by what?
<s> Joseph, the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges.  In my opinion he saved my army.
<s> How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
<s> I will continue with our French allies, concentrating on New York.
<s> War?  No!  I did not!  When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable.  There's no middle ground at all?  We're the King's children!
<s> I'm very aware of that.
<s> When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
<s> Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
<s> I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now.  My father is an ironmaster.  As was I.
<s> You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.
<s> They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
<s> You know very well who it is that I love.
<s> Those people?  I doubt they'd think of this.  Ooo, you're wonderful this color!
<s> Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
<s> I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
<s> Don't fade on me now, Bear. Not unless you wanna hold Farrah on your lap in a room fulla felons.
<s> I went to UC San Diego.  We're gonna spend the weekend at the Universal Sheraton. We're gonna take the tour. See the shark. Check out the Miami Vice Action Spectacular. After, we'll come here, get our money.
<s> Harry, let me answer that.
<s> It's what he said, I'm his associate.
<s> With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
<s> There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
<s> Gimme an hour.
<s> Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
<s> What I been wondering is where's he been.
<s> Who?
<s> I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here.
<s> Where you been, Harry?
<s> Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
<s> I said I had an idea, that's all.
<s> They always paid.
<s> Not really.
<s> Maybe a few times I have.
<s> It's not bad when you know what it's about.
<s> Let's see how we get along.
<s> Never say anything unless you have to.
<s> I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
<s> Cash. It happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport.
<s> I mean, at least Bo's invested in three of my movies.
<s> Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key.
<s> Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya.
<s> Personally?
<s> Martin, look at me.
<s> Compass.
<s> You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
<s> Lemme get this straight. You aren't responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine, but you're gonna find Ray Bones' coat or get him a new one? Is that what you're telling me?
<s> I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
<s> I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
<s> I don't like the title. Or the main guy's name.
<s> Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
<s> Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
<s> He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
<s> You're as bad as Harry...
<s> You bet.
<s> Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
<s> That's what the guy said.
<s> Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
<s> That's where you got the idea?
<s> I'm intrigued, yeah. You know what might help you, take a look at the Cylone again, the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels. Hey –-  This your ride, Chili?
<s> Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over.
<s> Arctic Warrior, passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea day two month two year one nine five three.  Over.
<s> Roger that, North Island. Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. Over and out.
<s> Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
<s> After fifty years there ain't nothin' left but shoe leather.
<s> Why not.
<s> Maureen?
<s> What're you crazy?
<s> So we kill him?
<s> Seen a lota movies.
<s> You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
<s> I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
<s> What is it?
<s> I don't know what you're talking about?
<s> Maybe you can tell me then.
<s> Then you're a lucky man.
<s> Right.
<s> Too big. More like a freighter.
<s> Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.
<s> You're a pal.
<s> They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
<s> It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.
<s> Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.
<s> What?
<s> If it was a ship she hit.
<s> That much I think we've already established.
<s> Right here.
<s> Leave him till we can get some help.  From now on, nobody comes down here.
<s> The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.
<s> I wish I could believe that. Either way, you know what I've done. I've got no choice.
<s> Of course they did.
<s> It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
<s> Leave it.
<s> You think whoever did this is reasonable?
<s> You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.
<s> I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
<s> Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
<s> Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.
<s> I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
<s> So what do you think?
<s> Help me what?
<s> But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
<s> Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
<s> This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
<s> Oh my God, that's HIM!
<s> Hi.
<s> Yeah, well... hi...
<s> It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!
<s> I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...
<s> I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
<s> Why?
<s> Unless they're in your Summer school class!
<s> I know, she needs to die immediately.
<s> Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
<s> Okay, okay!
<s> God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
<s> Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
<s> You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
<s> What a little hosebag.
<s> I remember every minute of that party.
<s> I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.
<s> Shh, it's his answering machine...  We hear the indistinct traces of a musical message followed by a faint BEEP.
<s> Totally! Look!
<s> I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
<s> Come on, it's too late now...
<s> Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
<s> Let's go hassle Josh.
<s> He does that every single day.
<s> No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
<s> He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
<s> I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime...
<s> I can't imagine spending money on towels.
<s> What thing?
<s> Do you still want to do something tonight?
<s> I can't believe it - he actually scored!
<s> What are you talking about? Who?
<s> Nothing.
<s> I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
<s> But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
<s> Actually, he's a really nice guy.
<s> Umm... That's not officially for sale... I might have to hang onto that for the time being.
<s> It's kind of falling apart.
<s> Norman.
<s> Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
<s> Oh, right...
<s> Good luck...
<s> I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
<s> I really didn't get a good look at her.
<s> Jesus, Seymour.
<s> Just wait here.
<s> I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --
<s> Then again, that's easy for me to say, since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.
<s> Who knows?
<s> Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.
<s> How can you be so sure?
<s> Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
<s> Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?
<s> So, do you like me, Seymour?
<s> Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
<s> Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."
<s> What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
<s> ...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
<s> So where would we go?
<s> I dunno, I...
<s> What do you want?
<s> I will if you want to.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I don't know... where is she, then?
<s> On that I choose to remain dubious.  Two are dead now in two nights. 
<s> He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
<s> As are they all.
<s> -at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-
<s> Yes he is.
<s> What have they done besides kill Starling?  How many have they killed? 
<s> In point of fact, it didn't.  But I'm convinced the theory is sound.
<s> We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
<s> He just gave me his "monster" speech.
<s> Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life. 
<s> Does he speak English?
<s> What?
<s> Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
<s> I can try.
<s> It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
<s> Look out, Samuel, here it comes.
<s> Because I have two plans to kill the lions- one involving the cattle, the other the men.
<s> I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
<s> He didn't "ditch" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it.
<s> You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
<s> Thanks.
<s> I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.
<s> Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
<s> Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
<s> Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
<s> For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
<s> Same difference.
<s> Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
<s> Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you?  The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too.
<s> My pleasure.
<s> We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list.  Your name was first.
<s> Oh, Johnny.  Did you back the wrong horse.
<s> Command me, lord.
<s> Yes.
<s> Get on with it, counselor!
<s> I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
<s> Like what?
<s> Then you should go to the police.  I don't believe in any of that stuff.
<s> Objection.  Irrelevant and immaterial.
<s> Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.
<s> A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he.
<s> You might want to check those Duke University mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
<s> This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy.  Just before his head died, his last words were, "Death is but a door, time is but a window.  I'll be back."
<s> Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you.
<s> Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
<s> If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
<s> You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
<s> Yeah, sorry I missed it.  I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
<s> Good effort.  Now what?  Should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, Ray?
<s> Yeah, but what a ride.  You can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow.
<s> I guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.
<s> You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
<s> It is a star!  That's great.  You're very good.
<s> Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
<s> So what do you think it was?
<s> Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
<s> That's a violin concerto.
<s> No?  What do I act like?
<s> I'll scream.
<s> Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
<s> I want you inside me.
<s> I am Zuul.  I am ...
<s> Talk to my accountant. 
<s> Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
<s> Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
<s> Die in what sense?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Has this ever happened before?
<s> Did you ever report it to anyone?
<s> Yes, sir.  Don't worry.  We handle this kind of thing all the time.
<s> Forget it, Venkman.  You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  Now it's my turn, smart-ass.
<s> Probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the Army ...
<s> You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
<s> I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
<s> They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
<s> When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?
<s> I agree.
<s> I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
<s> What do I say?
<s> Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
<s> If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
<s> Do you know when that might be?  We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.
<s> I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
<s> I can't take much more of this.  The pace is killing me.
<s> No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
<s> Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
<s> Right.  We'll believe anything.
<s> Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me.
<s> If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
<s> You flatter me, Caesar.
<s> If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose you.  Then, the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again.
<s> We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
<s> I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans.
<s> This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
<s> Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad?
<s> That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
<s> Yes, because I know they'll read it.
<s> Sneaking around with your brother?
<s> Yours will do!
<s> Hidden.  Where my brother cannot place hands on them.  He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all.  The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe.
<s> The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
<s> You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
<s> They fear me.
<s> What deal?
<s> General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
<s> I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
<s> Don't be ridiculous.
<s> Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
<s> You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you?
<s> I want nothing to do with the arena.
<s> Yes.
<s> No -- why should I?
<s> Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
<s> Yes.
<s> Because I want to know what's happening.
<s> GET OUT!
<s> Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
<s> What do you think?
<s> Elaine -- I love you.
<s> Because it isn't true.
<s> Then what?
<s> My belt.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Carl who?
<s> Well -- I said I might marry him.
<s> Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's brother -- Reverend Smith -- and I am supposed to perform the ceremony. I just got in -- from -- Portland -- and I've forgotten what church -- you see?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Yes I am.
<s> Oh -- no sir.
<s> I am going to call the police now.
<s> What?
<s> It's in the main ballroom.
<s> It's down the hall.
<s> No.
<s> Is what a girl?
<s> That's right.
<s> What?
<s> Right.
<s> Why not?
<s> Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
<s> What?
<s> What?
<s> I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
<s> Oh. Hello. Hello.
<s> That's fine.
<s> Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
<s> Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
<s> No.
<s> There!
<s> I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
<s> He's asleep.
<s> Calm down, Benjamin.
<s> Thank you.
<s> We've talked enough, Benjamin.
<s> Not exactly.
<s> See if you can guess.
<s> Think real hard, Benjamin.
<s> Don't tell Elaine.
<s> Why are you asking me all this?
<s> How do you think.
<s> We'd go to his car.
<s> Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
<s> I can makes things quite unpleasant.
<s> Where is Elaine?
<s> I'll find her.
<s> Sure.
<s> Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
<s> That has nothing to do with it --
<s> No. She doesn't know about it.
<s> No. Actually -- she doesn't know about us getting married yet.
<s> Swell. I appreciate it.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Oh no.
<s> No, it's not --
<s> It was nothing to do with you, sir.
<s> Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
<s> Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
<s> Well?
<s> You're a fool!
<s> That.
<s> Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
<s> Would you like to make a man happy?
<s> Because you love me -- you love me?
<s> No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
<s> You mustn't talk Russian to me.
<s> Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear -- 
<s> You are beautiful!
<s> When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and ---
<s> I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
<s> Suzette will be back here in a minute.
<s> When are you leaving Berlin?
<s> I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
<s> Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
<s> No?
<s> Yes -- I will be on the train.
<s> Bless you --
<s> I'm Baron von Gaigern.
<s> Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --
<s> General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
<s> Yes, quite.
<s> All right then.
<s> You've lost everything?
<s> No -- no please -- oh, don't go -- don't go -- don't leave me alone, Baron.
<s> Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
<s> I thought she was splendid!
<s> No doubt you would, Baron. But do you know, I'm quite indispensable to her. I'm her ballet master and her nurse. I hardly belong to myself anymore. But, there you are, it's Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her.
<s> We shall see who remains here the longer.
<s> Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
<s> Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.
<s> Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
<s> More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
<s> Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
<s> Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
<s> She's beautiful -- isn't she?
<s> I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
<s> Yes --
<s> I didn't like Preysing right off.
<s> Money!
<s> Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.
<s> Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.
<s> Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?
<s> I'm the stenographer.
<s> Moreover...
<s> Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...
<s> Have you got it now?
<s> Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
<s> Well -- you want me?
<s> Wait -- I must figure it up.  First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice?
<s> A thousand marks -- 
<s> I had to arrange about the trip.
<s> Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
<s> Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
<s> Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
<s> What -- what is it? Last night...
<s> There was -- there was.
<s> Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
<s> Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
<s> I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter ---
<s> Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
<s> Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
<s> I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
<s> I want to keep my teeth.
<s> My son was in the hospital --
<s> I never fucked up before, Bobo.
<s> Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
<s> A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
<s> Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
<s> Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
<s> So here we are!
<s> We're not really interested, Henry.
<s> Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
<s> Well, make it stop!
<s> Why? What's wrong?
<s> But what's wrong?
<s> I'll get you a check.
<s> You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
<s> Hello.
<s> Roy Dillon.
<s> I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
<s> Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
<s> I guess I owe you my life.
<s> Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called.  Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
<s> Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?
<s> You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
<s> The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a nag called Bluebell. I should have been on it. But that was the day after you came in here, so I stuck around to see how you were gonna be.
<s> He let me live. He let me be his friend.
<s> Get off the grift, Roy.
<s> Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
<s> Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm giving you good advice. I'm following it myself.
<s> I know you do, so that's why --
<s> Oh? I didn't know anything was.
<s> Not very good!
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> A future. The only future I've got.
<s> ) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
<s> Scram. Go home.
<s> Always, for you, baby.
<s> Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
<s> I just do what the doctor says, babe.
<s> You already went back to work.
<s> I'm a salesman.
<s> Myra, I'm not following this.
<s> And when he got serious?
<s> And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
<s> Yeah? How?
<s> ) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
<s> But the setup's there. It's there now.
<s> Bullshit!
<s> Not many.
<s> Oh, yeah. That's that.
<s> Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
<s> Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
<s> Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
<s> Only the real stiffs.
<s> What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
<s> It's Amy Kramer.
<s> Doesn't look good.
<s> My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
<s> Betcha' didn't predict that.
<s> I was trying to get away from someone.
<s> Afraid not.  You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
<s> Is that all you guys can think about?  Amy never came back last night.  Maybe she's in trouble.
<s> You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
<s> I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
<s> Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
<s> Can't you hold it?
<s> Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
<s> Have enough fun for the both of us.
<s> Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
<s> Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair? It's only Halloween.
<s> Someone's trying to scare us out of having this fair ... and it's not gonna work.
<s> Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
<s> But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
<s> Guess so ...
<s> Relax, John.  They were just kids.
<s> You'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach, Kara.
<s> Jamie?  But I thought she was --
<s> No -- please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
<s> Him.
<s> Here.  Let me try.
<s> Kara, no!
<s> Wait a minute ...
<s> You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
<s> It's a sign.  He's come home.
<s> Why did you take Jamie?
<s> Stay away, Sam.
<s> Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
<s> One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
<s> After eight years in the jungle with you, I know Mrs. Wheeler better than I know anybody in the universe!
<s> This room is full of ghosts.
<s> One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern.
<s> He's a man.  Tell him you're a man.
<s> You did?
<s> I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
<s> Get used to it.  Back door, Paul.
<s> I've considered that.
<s> You're making a joke.
<s> Thank God!
<s> As a matter of fact--I am home.
<s> Everybody says he was so brave.
<s> They were in the same creative writing class.
<s> "Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy."
<s> Dad was never in England?
<s> I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
<s> Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
<s> I can't take my eyes off you.
<s> Who was it?
<s> Nothing.
<s> It's your house, Dad.
<s> I am Harold Ryan, her husband.  I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  I have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport.
<s> I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
<s> Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
<s> You are woman.  I know woman well.
<s> How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
<s> Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.
<s> Shouldn't you lie down?
<s> He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.
<s> I did?
<s> It's so--so stark.
<s> Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
<s> Ram it up your ass!
<s> I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
<s> I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
<s> No you're not!
<s> Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD  Goodbye.
<s> Hope.
<s> I see.
<s> He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
<s> He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
<s> Load it for her.
<s> Hello, Mother.
<s> And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
<s> I've literally got to run!
<s> A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
<s> Are--are you crying, Penelope?
<s> What a brilliant diagnosis!
<s> Lest we forget how cruel you are.
<s> The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. "Honor, " if you like.
<s> Now who's being cruel?
<s> We do survive, don't we?  You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard.  No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon.
<s> I'm high as a kite.
<s> You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
<s> Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
<s> And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
<s> I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
<s> More clowning!  Don't you see?
<s> Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.
<s> For what it's worth now, Harold Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word.
<s> You don't know?
<s> I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.
<s> She did?
<s> No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.
<s> Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've got--and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget.  He drove me to drink.  He drove his first two wives to drink.
<s> That is sad.
<s> Don't!
<s> Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.  Grownups can be pretty rotten, too.
<s> I don't want to live any more.
<s> Stay home tonight!
<s> A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
<s> Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?
<s> He can hardly talk.
<s> It is an emergency, isn't it?
<s> Maybe it's supposed to end now. Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way.
<s> Something happens to my confidence.
<s> He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
<s> He said one other thing.  It wasn't very nice.
<s> What's so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.
<s> Tonight's the night.
<s> The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."
<s> It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
<s> It's suicide!
<s> Which we do.  But we can stop doing that.
<s> You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?
<s> What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
<s> Mozart plays shuffleboard.
<s> No.
<s> You sure? We have regular sessions, too. Only twenty dollars?
<s> What are you doing?
<s> We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
<s> You may do that in the privacy of your room.
<s> Do you have any particular choice of girl?
<s> Pull out your cock.
<s> Yeah, yeah...
<s> That's all you got, three girls?
<s> I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area.
<s> What's that shade of blue called?
<s> You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
<s> She thinks so.  What do you do?
<s> Too bad. I wasn't in it.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Do you know where she lives?
<s> Tod might know.
<s> Something like that. How much do you make?
<s> Three hundred?
<s> Half now, half later.
<s> Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
<s> What rate?
<s> You don't understand shit.
<s> Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?
<s> No. But does it make any difference?  How did you get to be the way you are?
<s> They believe in the 'TULIP.'
<s> Fuck.
<s> I know what you mean. After a while they all look the same.
<s> Do you live in a house back in wherever.
<s> On your own land?
<s> So I guess we're both fucked, huh? But at least you get to go to heaven. I don't get shit.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?
<s> Where is she?
<s> They are?
<s> Just leave me alone.
<s> What plan?
<s> I thought you were quite good in it. I also like the girl in it. Really thought she was good.  I wondered if she was still around. If she was still working.
<s> Where is she? Where is the girl?
<s> No.
<s> I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
<s> Well...
<s> Let's go.
<s> What?
<s> What we got is just these here.  What you see.
<s> Film making can be pretty expensive...
<s> Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
<s> In other words, you want to get laid?
<s> He asked me. You going with anybody?
<s> You never heard of that?
<s> Oh.
<s> To anybody.
<s> My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
<s> How do you do. I'm Mrs. Chasen. Come in.
<s> Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
<s> Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
<s> None of that, lady.
<s> Where are the papers?
<s> Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
<s> Not very.
<s> Harold Chasen.
<s> Oh.
<s> It's very interesting.
<s> Thank you, but I really have to go.
<s> Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived.  Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold.  What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?
<s> Look.
<s> Well, I really don't drink...
<s> Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier.  Later, Frederick would chide me about it.  He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government.
<s> Superb.
<s> Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
<s> What was that?
<s> How ingenious! Tell me about them.
<s> Of course.
<s> With Life.
<s> Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
<s> But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.
<s> Really. Just put it there, Harold.
<s> Yes. They're old friends.
<s> Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
<s> Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
<s> Can't complain.
<s> Huh?
<s> No.
<s> During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
<s> Jeez, sir. That's pretty strong stuff.
<s> I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
<s> Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
<s> Harold!
<s> Harold!
<s> Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
<s> Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
<s> We've always been here.
<s> Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
<s> Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
<s> I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
<s> I know.
<s> She certainly has.
<s> And what about you?
<s> You were ALL human!
<s> Is he serious??
<s> You mean, outside... with her.
<s> Red, I found something --
<s> I'm lucky that way.
<s> I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
<s> See? I don't like that --
<s> Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ?
<s> "Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
<s> I think that is its hand.
<s> Who wards off demons.
<s> Is it bad?
<s> Oh, please. I'm not "pure of heart."
<s> Manning says I'm too soft on you --  The candy. Give him the candy.
<s> Not so fast. He barely knows him --
<s> That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
<s> Those things never work. Never.
<s> You call that thing a cigar??
<s> Father's back?  Still angry?
<s> My arm is fine. Where are you??
<s> Yes?
<s> That's right, Stud, hold me down.
<s> Shh! Just a second.
<s> "Need" is a good, solid word.
<s> Goodnight.
<s> Marco...
<s> Look, do you want the bed in or not?
<s> Oh, sod you.
<s> Not much.
<s> Julia's my second wife.
<s> You solved the box. We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures.
<s> No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
<s> I could lead you right to him. You could take him back to Hell instead of me.
<s> It's important.
<s> One last time. Give me the box.
<s> Oh.
<s> Oh my God.
<s> Just help, will you? Please God, help me --
<s> What kind of doors?
<s> And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
<s> It's just been empty a while.
<s> Why not?
<s> Just feeling a bit sick.
<s> Sure.
<s> Not much.
<s> We don't need a bed, do we?
<s> What's wrong?
<s> Wait a moment --
<s> Steve.
<s> I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
<s> Well come over, will you? See the place?
<s> Maybe you should give it some time.
<s> She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
<s> What?
<s> Yes!
<s> I have to get out.
<s> That's right. Cointreau.
<s> Just upstairs.
<s> Please. I want to see you home. All right?
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
<s> Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon.  You should get out of bed earlier.
<s> Well what's the point in that?
<s> I didn't know it was classified information.  I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy.
<s> It's not my car, now is it?  It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. Wow.  Fucking great.
<s> Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
<s> Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that?
<s> How do you know about that?
<s> So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
<s> Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
<s> Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
<s> I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
<s> Yeah.  I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.
<s> Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
<s> Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
<s> Well, I'll just make it for you.
<s> Can I help you?
<s> Liz, hold on a second --  What?
<s> Yeah but more than that.  I'm happy because I'm proud of us.  Because although our talents are small and peculiar, we use them to their best advantage.
<s> Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
<s> Think about it, Rob.
<s> We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...
<s> Is what better?  Better than what?
<s> I haven't felt like it.
<s> I guess.
<s> Is that the last of it?
<s> They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
<s> My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
<s> Yes, of course.
<s> Uh... No.
<s> Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
<s> Want to know what, exactly?
<s> It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
<s> Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.
<s> No, but...
<s> But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
<s> Harder.
<s> I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
<s> And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"
<s> Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Are you persuadable?
<s> Fair enough.
<s> I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
<s> This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
<s> You called this morning?
<s> Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
<s> No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well.
<s> Everything go alright?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
<s> I'm sure it isn't.
<s> Whiskey.
<s> I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
<s> P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
<s> Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
<s> Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
<s> It's in good condition.
<s> No thank you, I'm fine.
<s> You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute.
<s> Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
<s> You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
<s> At the moment?  Carl Smith.
<s> You needn't worry Miss Cartwright. I've been at this a very long time.
<s> You had to do _nothing_!
<s> You've been listening to rumors.
<s> You are.  Now.
<s> I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin.
<s> Yes.
<s> It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg.
<s> Yes.
<s> Why are you here?
<s> That would be difficult to explain.
<s> Of bodies.
<s> Come here, Brenna.
<s> I'm the last.  Oh Christ, I'm the _last one_!
<s> What do you want from me?
<s> Four?
<s> Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
<s> It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
<s> Your name is Conor?
<s> I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution.
<s> And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
<s> You are the same?
<s> Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
<s> You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod.
<s> You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
<s> There is an imperfection.  For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat.  Then it is over.  The end.
<s> Go to hell.
<s> It's like to kill me first.
<s> I feel hardly nothing.
<s> Do what you must.
<s> If you wish to play games, Major.
<s> Must he go?
<s> Your father must be smart.
<s> And the Bulgarian?
<s> He knows I'm here.  How?
<s> Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
<s> Good times then.  A man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears.  Not like now.
<s> He always did.
<s> How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?
<s> It's all we have.
<s> Are you here?
<s> What are you getting at?
<s> I presume it's a sword.
<s> A mystery.
<s> Open this door!
<s> I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
<s> It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
<s> He certainly -- hic -- does!
<s> Better make that a certified check, Walter.
<s> Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
<s> Hello, Bruce...
<s> You got it back, eh? There's something funny going on around here.
<s> Oh.
<s> Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
<s> No. My mother.
<s> Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
<s> No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over.
<s> Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
<s> That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.
<s> Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.
<s> Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.
<s> And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
<s> Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
<s> We'll take a chance on that, Burns.  Go ahead, boys. 
<s> Oh, trying to frame me, eh! I never saw this woman before in my life!
<s> Get out of here, you!
<s> Your luck's not with you now!
<s> Oh, yes I would. I'd know you any time --
<s> Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
<s> No, I can't.
<s> What's the matter?
<s> Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
<s> Look at this! 
<s> Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
<s> Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
<s> Yes. Where is he?
<s> I'd like to think.
<s> I get it!
<s> Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
<s> What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
<s> Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.
<s> Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
<s> That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I know it.  Can you imagine Butch doing this to me -- at a time like this?
<s> Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.
<s> In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
<s> That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
<s> Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
<s> Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
<s> I don't know what to do, Walter.
<s> Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
<s> Sure, Heaven! You've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!
<s> You grey-haired old Judas!
<s> What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
<s> I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
<s> I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
<s> Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it back by five.  Thanks, Duffy. Stick around. 
<s> Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
<s> Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?
<s> This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
<s> Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!
<s> Little rum in yours, too?
<s> I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
<s> Yeah. But I --
<s> The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
<s> Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
<s> Throw him out, Frank.
<s> Editorials?
<s> -- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
<s> What's the matter? Getting yellow?
<s> Yeah. I was never so tired in my life.
<s> I made it up just now, and who's asking you?  I know it's silly, honey, but do it for me, won't you?... Yes, right now.
<s> What's the matter with you boys? Afraid it might rain? If you want to go, I'll cover this end.
<s> Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.
<s> Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
<s> Very simple, Earl.
<s> Put down that gun, Earl.
<s> Wakin' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin' to me about things they don't understand. Callin' me a Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's got nothin' to do with bombs. It's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. You see that, don't you?
<s> Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to shoot him. You believe me, don't you, Mollie?
<s> Quiet, Mollie!
<s> Shut up, you!
<s> Huh?
<s> No, I don't think so.
<s> I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.
<s> I'll explain it tomorrow!
<s> You're insane!
<s> It's a simple story. Earl Williams works for the E.J. McClosky Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years. He starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty-two fifty. A year ago the McClosky Company goes out of business and Williams loses his job.  Take it away, Fred Wilson!
<s> We want to see you.
<s> No, you're out, Grandpa. It's my turn.
<s> Why?
<s> I don't mind.
<s> Yes.
<s> Bugger off, you bloody sod.
<s> Could.
<s> Ask her yourself.
<s> Thanks, son. I can hear it. I'm not sleeping, just closing my eyes.
<s> The land and the King are one, my son. If he stutters we falter. He's getting batter, and so are we.
<s> They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.
<s> We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
<s> Weeds will grow, Mac.
<s> Naturally.
<s> I will if you will!
<s> Well, it's off ration. We know that.
<s> What about R.J.?
<s> Yeah, I like the screaming too... it's so much more exciting.
<s> OK.
<s> Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
<s> You're welcome.
<s> Whoopie fucking doo.
<s> Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
<s> Great story Goober, how much?
<s> Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
<s> I don't.
<s> So, the guy goes to Hell and the devil says, "do you smoke?" The guy say, "yeah"... the devil say, "great cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest Cuban cigars you ever had."
<s> How awesome?
<s> Cat fight, cat fight.
<s> Fuck. I think we blew a tire.
<s> Man, it's already ten thirty.
<s> What!
<s> Aw, she was with some nosey, smartass high-rise kids. They were poking around... asking stupid questions.
<s> Hmmmmm.
<s> Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something.
<s> Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.
<s> It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
<s> I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
<s> That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
<s> You got to be fucking joking.
<s> What? I didn't hear anything.
<s> A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
<s> You find something, Georgie?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
<s> I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?
<s> You said it, not me.
<s> Huh?
<s> Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
<s> Sorry.
<s> Oh, come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way...  ...but if you'll notice...  right here, needs a little something, heh?
<s> Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
<s> I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this.
<s> Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like I always fucking do.
<s> Shhhh... you hear that?
<s> Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, that's a strange one.
<s> Christ, you know it's crazy...  I lived through so many other people's nightmares, you know. Always cool and calm, but... but I never thought I'd be the one needing help, ya know?
<s> I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
<s> I always favored the Hulk.
<s> Excuse me for a second.
<s> Son, your mother and I are doing a production of The Gin Game at the local community theater. We forgot to take off our make-up.
<s> Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
<s> Woof.
<s> Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
<s> I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
<s> I don't know. Something's missing.
<s> I want to be the way I was before.
<s> Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you.
<s> I really like him, Rose. He's so...  ...passionate about his work.
<s> Really?
<s> Lila, it's Rosie.
<s> Lila, I want to help you.
<s> With pleasure.
<s> I'm really glad you two found each other.
<s> They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, "Ewww. A slug."
<s> I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
<s> How's it going?
<s> You look wonderful. I'm on top of the world tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly and my personal life is ...
<s> You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
<s> Yes, darling.
<s> Of course.
<s> A deer?
<s> If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.
<s> You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
<s> Nothing. Be right out.
<s> Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
<s> Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
<s> I guess.
<s> Shit.
<s> I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.
<s> It would be my pleasure, doctor.  Distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community, I stand before you today, a living testament to the amazing skill of Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces, then to crayons, and then to an appreciation of the complex works of Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive masturbation to...
<s> here, here.
<s> Oh please, is that as articulate as you can be after all the time I spent teaching you? We've discussed Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not that you ever had anything very original or challenging to say on the subject.
<s> Down from the tree. Both of you. Keep your hands where I can see them. Don't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur.
<s> Yes?
<s> Yes... Derek.
<s> Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though.
<s> Right.
<s> No, I'm fine.
<s> Soon as I finish my coffee.
<s> I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?
<s> We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah.
<s> Cash.
<s> Sit down.
<s> Thought you only drank milk.
<s> I lost twenty bucks.
<s> Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?
<s> Thanks for the drink.
<s> Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
<s> Where do I sign?
<s> You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
<s> Means I got confidence that he's a loser. All the way a loser. You happen to be about only one-half loser -- the other half, winner.  I'm finished.
<s> Nah. Sit tight. He'll be over here.
<s> Well, I win sometimes.
<s> It's a long walk.
<s> What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
<s> Comes right in this poolroom every night, eight o'clock on the nose. Just stay where you are. He'll find you.
<s> Oh, come on, stop stalling. Grab yourself a cue.
<s> Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
<s> Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.
<s> Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
<s> I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie.
<s> You wanted ten thousand? You got ten thousand.
<s> Go on home. Just leave me the money.
<s> Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
<s> Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.
<s> Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
<s> How much?
<s> No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
<s> Oh no, nothing for me.
<s> Oh man, you're way out of our league.
<s> I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat.
<s> Yeah, I'm quittin'.
<s> Fine, thanks.
<s> Eight o'clock.
<s> Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
<s> I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
<s> The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
<s> No.
<s> I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
<s> Museums... art galleries... concerts.
<s> When you've got money, you'll pay.
<s> I've got something in my bag.
<s> Would he know?
<s> Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
<s> More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
<s> Why should I?
<s> Nine ball.  Three ball.
<s> Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket.
<s> You watch me.
<s> That's good, Eddie. For how much?
<s> No.
<s> We move.  Place to place.
<s> Yes.
<s> You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
<s> We don't know that --
<s> Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers.  Now I... remember.
<s> Well, it's not supposed to be done anyway.
<s> I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
<s> It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
<s> It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.
<s> That's Mars.  The closest planet to us, now.  That's why it's more than just a point in the sky.
<s> What, Jim, what?
<s> He was upset with moving, I believe.
<s> I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
<s> Behind my house, up on the ridge.
<s> Hide the car.
<s> I don't know.  I don't know what I'm doing here --
<s> Mom -- this is the best show all year.
<s> Why, yes.
<s> We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
<s> I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
<s> Walk to the window. Right in front of you.
<s> I want you to leave with us. Right now.
<s> I take it you've heard.
<s> If anything goes wrong I'll have to think quickly, adjust the signal, who knows?
<s> My ex-husband works in satellite communications.
<s> More than likely.
<s> He used to run the NASA. He knows where all the bones are buried. Comes in handy.
<s> Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?
<s> Can you believe this?
<s> Haven't you been watching?
<s> This, pops, is every phone book in America.
<s> I can't shake her free.
<s> Doesn't matter. Game's over.
<s> Then God help us.
<s> We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
<s> Then find them.
<s> I think our secret is out. They're headed right for us.
<s> Yeah, but what an entrance!
<s> No. Exotic.
<s> We're already over Mach 2!
<s> Jimmy, stay with me.
<s> Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
<s> I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
<s> Not all too dissimilar to us. Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold... probably why they're interested in our planet.  Hey, you wanna see them?
<s> These three died in the crash. Their bodies are as frail as our own. You just have to get past their technology, which is, I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.
<s> Here... now.
<s> Peace? No peace.
<s> I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head!
<s> What is it?
<s> It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
<s> My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?
<s> The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
<s> I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a Franciscan friar, I think.
<s> Yes?
<s> Yes?
<s> Are you sure?
<s> The Grail Diary.
<s> I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors.
<s> How do you know?
<s> I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
<s> I came to get you! What do you think?
<s> Don't worry -- I'm fine.
<s> Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
<s> Look, can we discuss this later?
<s> Umh?
<s> She talks in her sleep.
<s> I'm out, Dad!
<s> You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
<s> Booby traps?
<s> Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
<s> Relax.
<s> Hmmm... What did we talk about?
<s> Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
<s> Fly... yes. Land... no.
<s> More or less.  Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
<s> Who cares? As long as they're keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I organize some transportation.
<s> Ready.
<s> That was seven hundred years ago.
<s> I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
<s> I'll take the camels.
<s> If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
<s> Just a routine inspection tour.
<s> This is a different situation, Dr. Jones. These people are like children. We have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century.
<s> No, he's a very shrewd old boy. Power behind the throne and all that. He actually runs this whole province.
<s> Finally!
<s> It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.
<s> No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
<s> A very fine collection of very old pieces, don't you think?
<s> There are no stories anymore.
<s> Dr. Jones, in our country a guest does not usually insult his host.
<s> Lao She.
<s> Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me and Wu Han --
<s> Just a statue.
<s> No.
<s> Okay, Shorty... see you in the morning... I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie.
<s> Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
<s> I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here.
<s> Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?
<s> The old man saw it in a dream.
<s> First of all -- don't panic!
<s> It's pulling me deeper!
<s> THE WHAT?!
<s> Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient..." So, look where I got.
<s> I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.
<s> Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an ugly critter like that!
<s> Willie!
<s> I'm going down.
<s> I'm not leaving without those stones.
<s> I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
<s> What above the curves?!
<s> You got it!
<s> Willie, come on!
<s> What's going on?
<s> Al.
<s> Yes.
<s> What is your name?
<s> Where are we?
<s> What street?
<s> ...I need to make a phone call.
<s> Where are we now?
<s> With a man in my head...
<s> If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
<s> Whatever you do, just...don't stop.
<s> Why?
<s> They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need."
<s> I'll sue.
<s> We have to get out of here.
<s> Take a left and your next right.
<s> Who did?
<s> I can't remember..
<s> Who cares?
<s> You'll be me.
<s> How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
<s> The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
<s> I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
<s> The sand.
<s> What was?
<s> What?
<s> Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
<s> Looks like...the optic nerve. I can see out!
<s> You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
<s> That place. By the window.
<s> I don't know what's going on.
<s> My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
<s> Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know.
<s> What am I supposed to do?
<s> Oh come on.
<s> It wasn't like that.
<s> ...Shit! It's just money.
<s> The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now.
<s> Now, you're too suspicious.
<s> I'll get us out of here.
<s> RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.
<s> Dieter?
<s> I insist.
<s> Don't worry.
<s> Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
<s> Rene?
<s> No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
<s> I dyed it. We're all getting old.
<s> Surveilliance on them all.
<s> I have a new client.
<s> You remind me of someone. You from the west coast?
<s> I think I've heard of you.
<s> Do what?
<s> Well what?
<s> I noticed you staring.
<s> Thanks, I appreciate that.
<s> Blake?
<s> Why?
<s> No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
<s> Is that Ryuji?
<s> Wanted to get to know you.
<s> You seemed interesting.
<s> I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
<s> I'm sorry. What will you do?
<s> I'm just on vacation.
<s> He must be a good friend.
<s> It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
<s> Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
<s> He plays it all the time.
<s> Where would you go to sell a chip?
<s> This going to work?
<s> He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
<s> I can't fly it.
<s> I'll come back for you.
<s> Now what?
<s> That's twenty feet high.
<s> It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.
<s> ...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as possible. Will you be able to wait?
<s> Why?
<s> It is?
<s> It doesn't hurt.
<s> I heard them.
<s> You got a deal. 
<s> Monday.
<s> What? Forget it.
<s> Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.
<s> Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
<s> I'm cooking pasta primavera.
<s> It's not a rumor. It's a sale.  If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?
<s> Yes, I'm afraid I did.
<s> If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...
<s> Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!
<s> Okay. 
<s> How are you, Jim?
<s> Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...
<s> Soy sauce...
<s> I didn't want to leave it there...
<s> No, thank you.
<s> Did you say Berman?
<s> "60 Minutes"?
<s> Will he go on-camera and talk about the Mexico City branch?
<s> I'm alone on this...
<s> Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point.
<s> Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
<s> ...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...
<s> You eating with us?
<s> I did? What do I tell a source on the next tough story? Hang in with us. You'll be fine... maybe?
<s> Yeah... Thank you.
<s> Jump in, quick, c'mon...
<s> They're afraid of you, aren't they?
<s> I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial.  Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
<s> Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
<s> Makes you feel good? Putting what you know to use?
<s> Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
<s> You charge by the hour?
<s> Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me.
<s> What does this have to do with my testimony?
<s> I told the truth... I told the truth.
<s> Well, what do you really think, though?
<s> Where you staying now?
<s> And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
<s> "The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..."
<s> Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
<s> I'd rather play than talk about it.  What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here.
<s> ...we worked together for, what was it, three years...? Now, the work we did here is confidential, not for public scrutiny... any more than are one's family matters...
<s> ...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
<s> And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
<s> We'd better go before we get thrown out.
<s> After you, Doll.
<s> What part?
<s> You have the pre-nup?
<s> So, that's good, right?
<s> And you must be Mr. Massey.
<s> "Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery."
<s> Why would you be here?
<s> I know you do.
<s> So I hear. Is that all?
<s> Miles. Miles. Miles.
<s> Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
<s> Miles?
<s> Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
<s> You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
<s> Boy. Boy, oh boy.
<s> No, we're not!
<s> Don't go. Stay with me for a while.
<s> I bet.
<s> The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
<s> I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --
<s> Hello Miles.
<s> It's not something I wanted either.
<s> Dogs?
<s> Marylin.
<s> Sometimes I forget.
<s> Please!
<s> Of Massey Myerson?
<s> Oh, God!
<s> So where are you now?
<s> They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.
<s> Hello Miles.
<s> I guess.
<s> He would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in Palm Springs. He had a device he called the Intruder.
<s> Yes?
<s> My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
<s> Heh heh.
<s> Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
<s> Please -- let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your bottom line?
<s> Maybe I should reconsider my...
<s> Miles.
<s> The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
<s> Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
<s> It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
<s> Yeah.
<s> You're a peculiar chap.
<s> A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
<s> I don't want to eat!  And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.
<s> If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
<s> We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
<s> Never mind—I'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
<s> I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
<s> Oh, hello, Dad.
<s> No.
<s> I don't know very much about him.  Except that I love him.
<s> It'll do no good.  He despises me.
<s> He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
<s> He's marvelous!
<s> Is that his name?
<s> Well, if it isn't the groom himself! You're just in time, King.
<s> All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statement—that you've had a talk with me—that we've reached an understanding—that if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
<s> Lower the boats!
<s> Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
<s> Sock her!
<s> Yes, of course.
<s> But the lady says—
<s> "Young people in love Are very seldom hungry. People in love Are very seldom hungry . . ."
<s> Hey, whadda you tryin' to do—kid me?
<s> Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
<s> Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
<s> You win!
<s> Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
<s> Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you—  scram.
<s> That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
<s> Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that—
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Are you talking to me!
<s> You're not really serious about this, are you?
<s> Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
<s> Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
<s> What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  You—you had it pressed.
<s> Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
<s> Outside!
<s> If you didn't waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummer—we'd have been through with breakfast by this time.
<s> Egg. One egg—doughnuts—black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
<s> What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
<s> Yeah?
<s> One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
<s> Santa Claus?
<s> Well, you were!
<s> Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
<s> You didn't give that boy all your money?
<s> Of course it is.
<s> You're prejudiced.
<s> Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
<s> I don't want it now.
<s> Oh, no!
<s> Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
<s> Me?
<s> Why, you bully. I believe you would.
<s> I'm out! I'm out!
<s> Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
<s> Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
<s> Get out!
<s> How'd you like to be married to a wild cat like that?
<s> Yeah? Where?
<s> That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that—
<s> Don't "Joe" me.
<s> To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
<s> Never mind . . . Listen—suppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
<s> That she's going to marry somebody else.
<s> It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.
<s> Well, I'll be—
<s> Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas.
<s> I ain't got a hat.
<s> Yeah. Come on—come on!
<s> Why?
<s> Huh?
<s> Why—no—
<s> You're not kidnapping her, are you?
<s> You can trust me, Mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.
<s> "Threat to assassinate President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, November 22-23.  Information received by the Bureau has determined that a militant revolutionary group may attempt to assassinate President Kennedy on his proposed trip to Dallas, Texas, etc, etc..."
<s> Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
<s> Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
<s> Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
<s> Yeah, I guess you do.
<s> So why does he call himself Bertrand?
<s> We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.
<s> That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
<s> There's a word - orders.
<s> Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea...
<s> No, I did not.
<s> No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.
<s> Dave?
<s> What did they...
<s> Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you...  Dave?
<s> Photographs - compromising stuff. And he'll use 'em.  The Agency plays for keeps...  I knew Oswald.  He was in my Civil Air Patrol unit.  I taught him everything.  A "wanna be," y'know, nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch.  I treated him good.  He'd talk about his kid, y'know, really wanted her to grow up with a chance, but... He got a raw deal.  The Agency fucked him.  Just like they're gonna fuck me.
<s> They're Agency, too.  Don't you get it?  CIA and Mafia together.  Trying to whack out the Beard.  Mutual interests.  They been doing it for years.  There's more to this than you dream.  FBI fucking hates the CIA.  Navy Intelligence got something to do with it too.  Check out "Alan Pope" in Miami.  Jack Youngblood. Bill Harvey.  Colonel Roselli.  The shooter, I hear, was a Dallas cop - the bagman at Ruby's club.  I heard he shot his own partner.  Got that? Check out the rich fucks in Dallas. H.L. Hunt.  He's dirty.  That's all I know.  But the Agency always runs the show.  Check out something called "Mongoose"  Operation Mongoose. Government, Pentagon stuff, they're in charge, but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows, fun 'n' games man - check out Southeast Asia - that's the next big number - the heroin trail.  "Oh, what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive."
<s> Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
<s> Would you say this "Leon" was actually Lee Harvey Oswald?
<s> Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.
<s> Jack?  Jack was a pimp.  A bagman in Dallas for the Mob.  He used to run guns to Castro when he was still on our side.  Check out Jack Youngblood. Shit - we almost had Castro.  Then we tried to whack him.  Everybody's flipping sides all the time.  It's fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games.
<s> I had the cause of death.
<s> That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
<s> There's nothing wrong with feeling a little scared, Jasper, Virginia. Telling the truth can be a scary thing.  It scared President Kennedy, but he was a brave man.  If you let yourself be too scared, then you let the bad guys take over the country, don't you - and then everybody gets scared.
<s> The truth is that I heard between four and six shots.  I'm not going to lie for you.
<s> So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
<s> Presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.
<s> We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
<s> A Perry Russo?
<s> Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you at the Masquerade Bar down in the Quarter and several evenings later you had him over for dinner at your apartment on Dauphine Street.  Do you recall that?
<s> Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.
<s> I'm well aware of this asinine article.  And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper.
<s> Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
<s> You know I don't like these tribal rituals, Freckle Face.  I'm interviewing Clay Shaw this morning.
<s> You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
<s> I don't know what to say except I'm sorry.  I just don't have rabbits on my mind.
<s> Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
<s> You wanna know why?  'Cause that mother fucker Kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why!  Nixon was gonna be one of the great Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country.  Got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause Kennedy promised 'em too damned much. Revolution comin'.  Fascism's coming back.  I tell ya this - the day that Communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country.  I jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' Oswald who didn't know shit anyway.  People should know why that sumbitch was killed.  'Cause he was a Communist.  Put me on the stand, go ahead, I'll tell the same goddamn story, I'm proud of it, don't matter fuck all to me, things don't change.
<s> He's been in trouble before.  Used to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern Airlines, but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a 14-year old boy.
<s> What are you driving at, boss?
<s> Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
<s> I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
<s> Who?
<s> We need him back.
<s> I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
<s> If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.
<s> Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
<s> Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?
<s> Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison.  Your coffee's almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it.
<s> Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
<s> We can use all the support we can get.  I think these might interest you.
<s> The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
<s> I know. That's why I went.
<s> I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
<s> I need a favor.
<s> She wants to go back to work.
<s> What time do you have to be there?
<s> Sure.
<s> If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?
<s> You went out this morning and bought a gun?
<s> What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
<s> It's not really something I think about.
<s> I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
<s> Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell.
<s> Oh, are you? Does she know that?
<s> Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
<s> Why?
<s> He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
<s> What if I've figured a way?
<s> It may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money.
<s> You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
<s> In the bag underneath.
<s> Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
<s> So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
<s> Less ten percent.
<s> Thanks, but you have a good time.
<s> Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
<s> Yeah?
<s> What the fuck is that shit?
<s> Can I smoke?
<s> I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
<s> He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
<s> Who's the other one?
<s> Was she there?
<s> Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court.
<s> After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
<s> I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
<s> You'd take a polygraph on it?
<s> So what happens now?
<s> Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
<s> Dreaming.
<s> Keep it between us girls?
<s> Sure.
<s> Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
<s> Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
<s> Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down.
<s> One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand.
<s> The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?
<s> I don't think so, but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you.
<s> I told them.
<s> Yeah, I think a woman.
<s> Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
<s> I'll give ya ten.
<s> Man, I don't like that part.
<s> We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't gonna screw you. You haven't told me where I put it for you.
<s> Sure.
<s> No.
<s> That sounds like a problem.
<s> Sure.
<s> And your point is?
<s> I'm getting out of here. What do you think?
<s> Yeah, down the end.
<s> Who's your partner?
<s> Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
<s> The moon -- I dunno
<s> That's not what I meant when I asked did you trust her.
<s> Well, why the fuck keep her around?
<s> I told you, man.  She my fine little surfer gal.
<s> That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle Lou- is, is it that one?" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Maybe a minute. She came right out.
<s> Tell me.
<s> Cops can't locate him, huh?
<s> Cost you a thousand for the bond.
<s> You don't say.
<s> Haven't a clue.
<s> I got some more business for ya.
<s> What?
<s> She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
<s> My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch.
<s> You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
<s> Have her bring the money here.
<s> No.
<s> It's Beaumont.
<s> We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.
<s> Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV.
<s> I was gonna tell you...
<s> Let me speak to Max Cherry.
<s> Where do you want to go?
<s> No! Oh God.
<s> I see.
<s> How do you know?
<s> Yeah, ever since that ...
<s> I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
<s> There's nothing to expose.
<s> I'm hanging up.
<s> It was the window.
<s> Tell your mother.
<s> What else did he say, Jake?
<s> What can I tell you?
<s> What did she have to say?
<s> She told you that?  Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm still paying for the orthodontist? I'll bet she didn't mention that.
<s> I thought you said she didn't say much.
<s> Wiggle your toes.
<s> I know.
<s> There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
<s> I haven't seen her in months.
<s> That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
<s> Go to sleep.
<s> Save me!
<s> Where is the lamp?
<s> No. Have you seen my glasses?
<s> Jezzie, I can't see.
<s> Well, personally, I never went for church names.
<s> Lemme see.
<s> Look at her face. A real bitch.
<s> Not to me.
<s> How's it going?
<s> They weren't human!
<s> Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
<s> Jezzie?
<s> You wanna know? Turn on the T.V. Watch the fucking news!
<s> It might be for me.
<s> I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
<s> I promise.
<s> How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
<s> With wings.  You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
<s> Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
<s> I'm tired.
<s> Don't be funny.
<s> Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
<s> Sit down, Jake.
<s> How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
<s> You know who I am.
<s> Yeah. But not with the Cong.
<s> Sometimes. When it's convenient.
<s> I don't know what to say.
<s> That's a lie. My family was here.
<s> No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
<s> Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?
<s> Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
<s> No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.
<s> He doesn't like it.
<s> Punk?
<s> Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
<s> What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship?
<s> Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
<s> Rizzo did.
<s> What?!
<s> He came for me, I had to run!
<s> Cool.
<s> The hull's imploding!
<s> What are you doing back?!!
<s> Two more charges to go.
<s> Let's move out!
<s> Thorgan, suit up.
<s> I don't know!
<s> My job.
<s> Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.
<s> What?
<s> Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on!
<s> Weapons? All this technology and what good has it done?!
<s> Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
<s> Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
<s> What if we don't?
<s> Well, do something!
<s> Remember to roll his balls around a bit.
<s> Let's just get out of here.
<s> Later.
<s> Jesus! Can't you knock?  Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.
<s> Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
<s> Oh shit! There he is!
<s> Who are you apologizing to?
<s> I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
<s> Then open the doors!
<s> They can deal with this sort of thing.
<s> Scientists. Very intellegent men.
<s> Exactly.
<s> What?
<s> Don't tell me my business!  Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.
<s> We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.
<s> I never hear the whistle.
<s> I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.  Ship it.
<s> Can you do that?
<s> Do I need any more authority?
<s> I was acting in the town's best interests...
<s> No, it was local jurisdiction.
<s> You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this?
<s> What stinks so bad?
<s> You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
<s> I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there.
<s> That means closing the beaches.
<s> You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
<s> Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
<s> No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though.
<s> A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
<s> That wasn't funny.
<s> Do I set the goddam hook?
<s> Transplants?
<s> Are you now. I know about porkers in the water --  Here. Tie me a sheepshank.
<s> 'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944.
<s> Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...
<s> Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
<s> I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
<s> But you copy my work every week.
<s> I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
<s> Huh?
<s> No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
<s> Oh, hey Vijay.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!
<s> No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
<s> Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
<s> Oh.
<s> That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
<s> Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.
<s> Here's to dovetailing interests.
<s> I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
<s> So, I've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird CD you made me.
<s> Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
<s> You've never been to a dance, have you?
<s> No?
<s> But you're old!
<s> I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
<s> Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
<s> Oh really?
<s> I went to the doctor today.
<s> Your name, please?
<s> Once! And she didn't die, if you recall!
<s> Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
<s> No, but you know Bren. She dreams big.
<s> Think you can narrow it down for me.
<s> It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state.
<s> I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!
<s> Yeah, but it sucks for free.
<s> I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.
<s> Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.
<s> Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
<s> There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
<s> Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
<s> She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.
<s> Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
<s> Adele... we gotta do something before Early kills someone else.
<s> ...I said, I like your hair.
<s> ...Yeah.
<s> Not really.
<s> Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky day.
<s> So you don't do any of those things.
<s> I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
<s> I don't know, they didn't speak too good English.
<s> Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?
<s> Well Adele... it was for...  ...saving your fucking life back there!
<s> Not so good. You sure you have to?
<s> What do you need a Bible for?
<s> Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't eat much in the mornin', never have. Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky Lager's my favorite.
<s> How much do I owe you?
<s> Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.
<s> No, it's all yours. It's on me... for saving my ass back there.
<s> ...I do.
<s> Why?
<s> I don't want to talk about it.
<s> Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
<s> What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
<s> ...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
<s> No.
<s> Siesta.
<s> Everybody just shut up!
<s> I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?
<s> What is it?
<s> Who are you?
<s> What?
<s> Yeah.
<s> To what? Virgins?
<s> What do you want?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
<s> Yep.
<s> Who?
<s> Bet.
<s> Why I give pennies?
<s> Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
<s> I'm telling you the truth. And after that, I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did.
<s> Good luck?
<s> Shut the fuck up.
<s> Naw. But we should run by the park and get a dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park.
<s> You are?
<s> Hold up man.
<s> Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
<s> Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
<s> At the block party?
<s> I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
<s> Nothing?
<s> Because, you know why. You know.
<s> Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
<s> 15.
<s> One.
<s> What?
<s> Of course. How am I gonna forgive him after what he did?!
<s> I know.
<s> And it's like. How much more can I bob here? You know.
<s> Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid.
<s> Whah you say? Dissdee?
<s> That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
<s> It's really slow. It's slow boring.
<s> Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
<s> Yeah.
<s> He still does.
<s> It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
<s> Oh god. That's horrible.
<s> Everywhere. Fuckin' flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub.
<s> It's grandmother style.
<s> What are you saying?
<s> You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
<s> His victims aren't random.  It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it.
<s> What do you want?
<s> Well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker.
<s> No, I need the original note.
<s> Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
<s> What?
<s> I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer.
<s> I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  You know, give him something to do.
<s> Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
<s> I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?
<s> It's a voice modulator.
<s> I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him.  Let him sweat for a little while.
<s> I haven't got time for this.
<s> We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
<s> If you got something to say to me, just come out and say it!
<s> I couldn't say it any better than Huxley.
<s> If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
<s> Last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  Have you figured out what I'm doing?
<s> If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
<s> Don't beg, Peter.  She has to die.  I can't win unless she dies.
<s> Oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
<s> --the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
<s> Don't patronize me!  You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!
<s> Mrs. Lutz.  She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.
<s> Thanks, David.
<s> Six, eight hours tops.
<s> We're not sure.
<s> I was thinking the same thing.  He must be local.  It's logical for him to assume that the police would be there, but he recognized Andy's voice and called him by name.  What about this?
<s> Meaning?
<s> Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed.
<s> I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
<s> I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
<s> Yes.  Why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure?
<s> About a quarter to one.
<s> What are you saying?  That I'm seeing what I want to see?  That I'm protecting a murderer?  What?
<s> I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
<s> We think he might be making a reference to drugs?  Miss Emma is a street term used by junkies for Morphine.
<s> "Is".  Did you tell him about the institute?
<s> But he had to dump the body there to make the move.
<s> Are we going to go through this again?
<s> I signed the confession.  What about the car?
<s> Mate in five.
<s> Yeah.  Just let me grab a shower.
<s> Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger.
<s> Yes.
<s> I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
<s> Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
<s> Getting too hot in here for you?
<s> Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
<s> Does what's going on bother you at all? Or are you just wearing your game face?
<s> Of course.
<s> I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
<s> And you?
<s> Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.
<s> What do you want on it?
<s> Then why are you backing up?
<s> How could you think that, Kathy?  How could you even consider it?
<s> I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
<s> I can't think any more, unless it's about you.  I'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, I think about how you look when you smile.  Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard?  Ever since my wife died I've been...  I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of losing them.
<s> Because she killed herself!!
<s> Why not?
<s> Frank told me.
<s> That's worse.
<s> We're not married <u>yet</u>.
<s> I know it.
<s> I have no extraordinary powers.
<s> In the old books. It's called a glaive.
<s> But there is another entrance to this place.
<s> You have rope?
<s> You won't have to.
<s> What do you see?
<s> Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.
<s> You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
<s> You will tell me her name and we will go together.
<s> Use your sword.
<s> Cut. <u>Cut</u>!
<s> No! You cannot know that!
<s> What will happen?
<s> Yes. It is today.
<s> Yes.
<s> <u>What</u>? Oh no! Better it was me. There isn't another good tomato within a hundred leagues.
<s> Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain.
<s> Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
<s> Subject to the King, no doubt.
<s> The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
<s> It's right behind you.
<s> You had better manners as a pig.
<s> We have plenty of hares.
<s> I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you.
<s> Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
<s> Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
<s> It is important to assure the succession.
<s> That I am, my lady.
<s> A match for your son, I think.
<s> Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
<s> The Widow of the Web?
<s> She has the power to kill.
<s> It's a hundred leagues from here.
<s> Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
<s> Yes.
<s> Of what?
<s> You lie!
<s> Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here.
<s> There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.
<s> ...Not at all.
<s> I'll explain you, Leon: they'll ask you to fill in a lot of forms and you can't write and they'll ask you your job, your employer's name and you can't tell them: My job, I'm a hitman and my employer is Tony, his record is longer than his resturant's menu.  That's why you can't have a bank account!
<s> Good.
<s> Yeah...  Come on, have a little training.
<s> Why?
<s> Of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us.
<s> That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
<s> Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
<s> I don't grow up any more. I just get older.
<s> I prefer waiting for a while...  I feel it would go the wrong way.
<s> Yes.
<s> Nothing, for the moment.
<s> Good! Snipers can't be in position.
<s> Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
<s> Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!
<s> Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
<s> No...
<s> I have new dreams now.
<s> I'm completing the walk.  I'm almost there.
<s> I won't let you die.
<s> Sergeant, I'm a psychologist and I know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... My uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.
<s> I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
<s> Thank you.
<s> No, I just don't want anybody dying because I didn't say something when I had the chance.
<s> That's enough.
<s> Pardon?
<s> Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?
<s> You have?
<s> The flowers... they're beautiful.
<s> Well, I'm sure it's not Christmas, because you'd be worried about how much money we don't have to spend on each other... I know it's not New Years, because you'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you don't like to dance... and I'm sure it's not our anniversary, because I didn't find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says, 'Pick out something pretty'... Yes -- Maurice -- I'm virtually certain it's not a special day today.
<s> I don't follow.
<s> Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night?  Are you going to show it to someone?
<s> Show me.
<s> You can change.
<s> It'll make it.
<s> No it's not.  He should be here with me now, not trying to find some fucking bottle of Johnny Walker.  He's never been there for me.  I've always been alone.
<s> I think it's a different place for each person.
<s> Go to sleep Ellen.
<s> I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
<s> Not our problem.
<s> Nine.
<s> Mammoth.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Never have children.  If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.
<s> California.
<s> Tomorrow.
<s> I told you.
<s> I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me.
<s> ... The Grapes of Wrath.
<s> Where am I?
<s> Forty-seven years.
<s> He's getting my sweater from the car.  I said there was a breeze.  I told him not to go.
<s> No.
<s> Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
<s> I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?
<s> Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
<s> Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
<s> Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
<s> Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
<s> I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
<s> I think you should wear one at a time. One of these... and one of your others. In fact, I was going to buy just one, but I didn't think it would fly... as a gift, I mean.
<s> Yeah... I'd like that.
<s> I didn't know I'd ever need it again.
<s> How much, do you think?
<s> Right here at the hotel. Why?
<s> Sorry. Look... you seem like a nice girl. I'm just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money.
<s> Where have you been staying?
<s> Yes, of course. How much do you need?
<s> What do you think... you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard?
<s> It's me, Yuri.
<s> Go to hell.
<s> You're fired. I have new representation.
<s> I believe you! Don't worry.
<s> Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
<s> No. I was in the shower.
<s> Is everything okay?
<s> But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my "career"?
<s> Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.
<s> Just the love in my heart.
<s> Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
<s> I don't know.
<s> She could use some mascara and some serious highlights, but she's not completely unfortunate-looking.
<s> No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
<s> Relation?
<s> Name?
<s> I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
<s> Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.
<s> What?!
<s> I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals, okay? I -- promise. I really want to do a good job.
<s> But maybe it is --
<s> Did your daughter ever say anything to you about Brooke and Heyworth's relationship?
<s> That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
<s> For a butt-head? Yes.
<s> I just don't understand what went wrong --
<s> Absolutely!
<s> I got bangs!
<s> Maybe she found him like that.
<s> So are you!
<s> So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
<s> What, like it's that hard?
<s> Thank you.
<s> I gave her my word, Warner.
<s> See?
<s> Really?
<s> Are you serious?
<s> I'm covered in very expensive Egyptian mud -- hardly naked.
<s> I mean, I know you're upset and all, but can't you just take a sedative?
<s> What do you want with me?
<s> I am afraid of nothing.
<s> I know no more of shame than I do of fear.  I wear this mask not for concealment but protection.
<s> What do you want from me?
<s> Oh, yes...
<s> And then?
<s> I don't expect you'd understand.
<s> And, now?
<s> Or looked so beautiful...
<s> So you shall be... Like our brothers, the hawk and the wolf, our spirits know no master... we are created in the pure image of the savage God that set our turbulent universe in motion.
<s> Oh no... Don't you understand?
<s> Honeythorn Gump, is it?  I've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears.
<s> Gump, is it?
<s> Didn't you now?  Well then, answer me this riddle and all be forgiven.
<s> What!
<s> If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee...
<s> And if she thinks me a liar?
<s> You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
<s> What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
<s> Better we eat him than the other way round.
<s> Something's coming.
<s> Careful, lad.
<s> The colt's still too small.
<s> Blackheart?
<s> What know you of fields of war?
<s> Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
<s> There's the way, mates.
<s> No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
<s> Nay.  This time we strike first!
<s> On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
<s> Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
<s> ... the Princess Lili... I've killed her.
<s> The wound is mortal.
<s> Don't get too far!
<s> I've not heard a note out of you.
<s> And did you?
<s> These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
<s> Three cheers for our champion.
<s> They've fired the moat!
<s> Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.
<s> If you like.
<s> Sport, indeed.
<s> Stop complaining.
<s> I'll go search for it.
<s> In these woods you are a commoner. Now be quiet.  True royalty approaches.
<s> Sunlight... It destroys him.
<s> I can't have been under much more than a minute.
<s> Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
<s> Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
<s> Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
<s> Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night.
<s> And am I not fair?
<s> Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
<s> Castle Couer de Noir built with magic... simple as death... strong as hate...
<s> To Castle Couer de Noir?
<s> You follow.
<s> I wanna be with you today.
<s> Sam!
<s> Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"?
<s> Uh...using Josh like that.
<s> Who are all these people?
<s> No.
<s> Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
<s> What's that?
<s> I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided.
<s> Where to?
<s> Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you.
<s> No thanks.
<s> You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
<s> What?
<s> Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
<s> If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
<s> He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
<s> What are you on?
<s> Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
<s> We were probably in school together.  You went to Berkley?
<s> For everything.
<s> Yes, it is.
<s> I'll hate you forever.
<s> I warned you yesterday.
<s> You're so predictable.
<s> I'd rather sell my nuts to a castrati.
<s> A friend of yours is here.
<s> You know that great thing, though?  Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one.  It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is.  Or it can just blow you away.  Make you something different in an instant.  It happened to me.
<s> We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
<s> I'm telling you now.
<s> I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
<s> Absolutely.  Have him put it on a separate line.  At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
<s> This was all for your sake, wasn't it? Having me here?  Trying to get me to like you.
<s> I'd build a house.
<s> I can die trying.
<s> We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know.  I liked your dad more than I liked you.
<s> I want you to find someone for me.
<s> You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
<s> But you can't call me while you think?
<s> Why would they tow your truck?
<s> Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
<s> At least we'll have a house to show for it.
<s> He's not spending the entire summer with another kid in Tahoe.  If he leaves, I will follow him up there and I will drag him home by his nose ring.  He can hate me.  You can hate me.  He can try to kill me while I sleep.  You can call the police.  You can call your husband or your attorney, but Sam is spending the summer with me.  He's my son.  He's sixteen.  That's it.
<s> Which?
<s> What have you been before today?
<s> It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.
<s> He won't use my shower.  I don't get it.
<s> This was my very first slow dance.
<s> No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
<s> I can hire workers to help me.
<s> Going on?
<s> What did I say?
<s> I didn't think you'd come today.
<s> Left you?
<s> What?
<s> It's not my back that's killing me.
<s> No.
<s> She wouldn't even fucking go out with until she was sixteen.  I mean, that's not even a rule, just her own thing.  She like figures things out on her own and then that's it.
<s> I didn't go in your room.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Enough for drinks, popcorn and candy!
<s> Nagger?
<s> And the baby?
<s> Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
<s> Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
<s> I look good tonight. And I feel lucky, too.
<s> It's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.
<s> You have to forgive me if I don't laugh.
<s> He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
<s> Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
<s> Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
<s> That's because I've never been here before.
<s> Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time.
<s> A loan officer?
<s> Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
<s> Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied!
<s> Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
<s> Yeah, I want some pie.
<s> What gave you that idea?
<s> What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward.
<s> He even got my daddy's watch.
<s> My daddy's watch. This is the dude I was telling you about --
<s> Shut up. It's too damn hot. What do you know, anyway?
<s> Yeah.
<s> We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
<s> I said you're soft.
<s> I knew you wouldn't come if I didn't have a map.
<s> They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
<s> Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
<s> All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
<s> That's the way it is.
<s> That was five years ago.
<s> Hey, there's Wilkins!
<s> He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
<s> I'm sorry, he's on medication...
<s> You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
<s> Made just for you, Cookie.
<s> Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
<s> You heard the boss! Let's move!
<s> Sixty-five years ago. They always said the farm couldn't hold 'em forever. Looks like you're finally free, boys.
<s> Don't argue with me. You need it more than I do. I know how a little money can help in a place like this.
<s> I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too.
<s> I believe in treating the convicts with respect, if that's what you mean.
<s> Me? Willie Long.
<s> You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
<s> That's my joint. The swinginest nightclub in town.
<s> I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
<s> But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
<s> Absolutely not.
<s> You want a queen? Got one right here.
<s> You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
<s> No.
<s> I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
<s> Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
<s> Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
<s> What can I do about it?
<s> The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
<s> I think you're looking at him.
<s> Everything's fine, pop.
<s> Please, pop, just go back to your room.
<s> You did it for Namath.
<s> Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
<s> The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
<s> Metallica, Dad. Come on.
<s> How bad?
<s> Coulda been much worse.
<s> That's a pretty brassiere.
<s> Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
<s> Oh, would you grow up.
<s> Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
<s> Oh, that's terrible, Reege...
<s> All right...
<s> You smell like coconuts.
<s> Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
<s> Why are you laughing?
<s> My dad's an optometrist.
<s> I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
<s> Okay, I do. Get back up here.
<s> Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
<s> Up there.
<s> Just wondered... what happens?
<s> Of course not! I'm curious, not sick. 
<s> Only a few? You're just not trying.
<s> Yes.  But you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
<s> You? Why? You're already beautiful.
<s> Did you ever see anybody renew?
<s> Anybody we know?
<s> ...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
<s> Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
<s> Why is it wrong to run?
<s> I suppose. But what if you want to live?
<s> Then it's still no.
<s> I'm going to run.
<s> You know something.
<s> It's different now. Help me.
<s> And I never heard of Sanctuary.
<s> That's tomorrow.
<s> Maybe you'll think of something...
<s> But what is this -- why?
<s> Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything...  ...to eat, of course.
<s> It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
<s> I don't know.
<s> What's that?
<s> We'll remember. But that's a long time off...
<s> Gracious... no.
<s> No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
<s> Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people.
<s> Sure, I'm okay.
<s> Yeah... Laurent.
<s> I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you.
<s> Are you positive he knows?
<s> Andy?
<s> Okay...
<s> We killed him.
<s> Up the stairs - down the hall.
<s> Sit down a minute.
<s> I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
<s> Yeah? what did they want?
<s> Did you tell the police this?
<s> You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
<s> I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
<s> You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
<s> What about yesterday?
<s> Pete, what happened to you?
<s> Who was the man?
<s> He won't give his name.
<s> I... I didn't say anything...
<s> No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
<s> The first night... Not the last two.
<s> But my head...
<s> No, no I don't. Are you sure?
<s> What do you mean? You're where right now?
<s> Alice who?
<s> I guess so.
<s> Two detectives are coming out.
<s> But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
<s> Okay... Lemme clear it with...
<s> Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.
<s> Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
<s> What?
<s> At your house. Don't you remember?
<s> Sure.
<s> It was weird...
<s> FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
<s> She's remaining in her room. She isn't feeling very well.  Now please go on without me. I eat very little.
<s> Yes. Those are our own people. They never venture beyond the point where you were met this morning. It is much too hazardous.
<s> Yes.
<s> Okay, brother.
<s> I beg your pardon.
<s> Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south—
<s> Now you're irritating and absurd!
<s> Of course. That's what I told them last night. You can't expect a man to sail around in the dark.[5] During this George has been looking around - he rises.
<s> Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
<s> Uh-huh.  Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
<s> This doesn't obligate me in any way.
<s> Nice puss to meet in a dark alley.
<s> Bryant's Utilities - that's me.
<s> Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business—
<s> Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
<s> Of course we have no money as you know it. We do not buy or sell or seek personal fortunes because, well, because there is no uncertain future here for which to accumulate it.
<s> Our Valley is very rich in a metal called gold, which fortunately for us is valued very highly in the outside world. So we merely . . .
<s> Oh, let me see - way back in 1713, I think it was, that Father Perrault stumbled into the Valley, half frozen to death. It was typical of the man that, one leg being frozen, and of course there being no doctors here, he amputated the leg himself.
<s> Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
<s> You're startled?
<s> Forgive me. I should have told you it is quite common here to live to a very ripe old age. Climate, diet, mountain water, you might say. But we like to believe it is the absence of struggle in the way we live. In your countries, on the other hand, how often do you hear the expression, "He worried himself to death?" or, "This thing or that killed him?"
<s> Why, Mr. Conway, you surprise me!
<s> I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?
<s> Yes, charming.
<s> Why not? She's an attractive young woman.
<s> I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
<s> I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
<s> Then it's done.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying to get out.
<s> Are you the High Lama?
<s> Sit down, my son.  You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.
<s> Come on! We'll burn the hangar. That will make light for them!
<s> How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!  People are going to point to me and say, "There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."
<s> I'm going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is.
<s> All right. Sorry, George.
<s> I don't know what you're talking about. You're carrying around a secret that seems to be eating you up. If you'll only tell me about it.
<s> I don't need any proof.
<s> Is that all my story meant to you?
<s> There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.  Come on.
<s> I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
<s> Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane?
<s> Yes. Hold this pigeon.
<s> I saw a man whose life was empty.
<s> Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
<s> Why?
<s> Yes.  Barney!
<s> You'll tell me some of the things I want to know, won't you?  You'll tell me who runs this place. And why we were kidnapped. And what they're going to do with us!
<s> And Goodwill Toward Man?
<s> Yes, air.  But I'm usually wrong. Sir.
<s> Don't worry about it.  It's been a long night.  Speaking of which-- you owe me a cup of coffee, remember?
<s> What?  Who the hell are you?
<s> Sir, you can't just--
<s> So what's the problem?
<s> I taught kindergarten.
<s> Something seem unusual to you about that?
<s> And what's this ... ?
<s> Kay.  All I'm saying--
<s> Everything left the planet, right? Except one thing.    That little insect-- the one we found in Sudbury.  Did it leave when everything else left?
<s> Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
<s> Kay!?
<s> And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
<s> I'd prefer if you were just a little more blunt.
<s> Do have any idea what I just said?
<s> It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
<s> Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
<s> I don't believe you, Mikey.  And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
<s> What if I don't?
<s> What is it?
<s> Then who was he?
<s> How did I not see this?  Agatha, who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively?
<s> Right.  I know --
<s> Yes, you did.
<s> I can't even stand up --
<s> This is the official composite of the three precogs?
<s> On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
<s> Lara --
<s> I understand.  What's the other thing?
<s> Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
<s> You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
<s> Case #1108, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
<s> Georgetown.
<s> Come on, Chief, you think about it, the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops.
<s> We're in motion on something.
<s> Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?
<s> Maybe you didn't hear me.
<s> There's no question.  You don't have any.
<s> Just a nickname.
<s> What does he think of your chosen line of work?
<s> It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
<s> To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
<s> Do I know you?  Who are you?
<s> There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...
<s> I need help with her.
<s> So?
<s> I guess that's all of it.
<s> That's great.
<s> You gotta have faith, Dad.
<s> I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.
<s> Who said I would?
<s> What the fuck is going on?
<s> Kill me!
<s> The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
<s> Do you?  Really?
<s> Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
<s> Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
<s> Sean --
<s> No.  I don't think you do.  The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.
<s> The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
<s> I don't want John Anderton hurt.
<s> What?
<s> Not quite.
<s> Yes... It's called an echo.  The act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the Precogs.
<s> Right here.
<s> Yes, I know.
<s> There's thousands of units like this one.
<s> How many?
<s> Yes.
<s> But John was with him at the pool?
<s> I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.
<s> To what?  Trap him?
<s> I haven't seen him in two years.
<s> See you later.
<s> Manhattan.
<s> He's alright.
<s> We used to take baths together.
<s> Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.
<s> What time is it there?
<s> Ho's a good guy --
<s> Get away from her.
<s> We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
<s> Quick drop. In and out.
<s> Sure. Yeah.
<s> Me? No. Not really.
<s> He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
<s> What is it?
<s> Good morning.
<s> Yeah, he's getting there on his own.
<s> Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
<s> Thanks.
<s> I'm not gonna bring it up to him.
<s> I will.
<s> Bye.
<s> I thought you hate that club.
<s> What happened to boxing? I thought we made a vow.
<s> What are we delivering?
<s> See? Now everyone's got one on.  What do you got there?
<s> I'm not taking her to a bar.
<s> Who's driving her?
<s> Is that the woman from..?
<s> We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
<s> Shhh... Hello, room service?
<s> Yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of Heinekens. I'm in room... How'd you know? Oh. Yeah. How long? Cool.
<s> Forty-six.
<s> Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.
<s> Nothing.
<s> I mean, that's what I heard --
<s> Missing what? He didn't say shit.
<s> Work's over. I'm gonna party.
<s> Fine.
<s> Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
<s> I swear to God, I didn't do anything.
<s> Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
<s> You want us strapped, don't you?
<s> The what?
<s> We don't need guns.
<s> Eighty bucks?!?
<s> What happened to the fifteen hundred?
<s> No more, man.
<s> How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
<s> Take us right to Kennedy. Now.
<s> You want your surprise?
<s> He's on the list.
<s> Ugh...
<s> Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
<s> What? Why am I bad?
<s> I'll tell him someone else told me.
<s> So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
<s> Like you were doing any better shucking and jiving like you were waiting for wings outside the Quick and Split.
<s> I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.
<s> Nah, see, Maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. He, you know, he tied in with the club. Set us up so, you know, you feel at home.
<s> You think it's funny, motherfucker?
<s> You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you.
<s> What?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> She poured it for --
<s> Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
<s> Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
<s> My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Solid, daddy.
<s> Let 'em come. I'm ready.
<s> I'm working on it.
<s> You _took_ me, you bastard, and now I'm taking you.
<s> Now.
<s> That really you, Red?
<s> Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. All I need's a stake and a  chance --
<s> Don't push it. You way ahead. You back on top. That boy loves you, man.
<s> When you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains. Cause that's what the white man wants you to do. Look at you.
<s> Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
<s> What do you do with your time?
<s> But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?
<s> Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting for you.
<s> Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
<s> Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening?
<s> The first men on earth were black. They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere. But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like that.
<s> Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
<s> Next week, Brother Minister.
<s> That you haven't time for either marriage or eating --
<s> I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
<s> How do you like it?
<s> Yes.
<s> Hush your mouth.
<s> Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
<s> Not yet. But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day.
<s> Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham.
<s> Burglary, count one -- 8 to 10 years; count two, 8 to 10 years; count three, 8 to 10 years...
<s> All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
<s> These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
<s> Brother Malcolm, I want you to meet Brother Earl. He just joined the Nation.
<s> You hear me, girl?
<s> Well, bitch you move too slow.
<s> Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for size.
<s> You the man!
<s> Yeah.
<s> What can you do?
<s> Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can.  This page?
<s> Am I a suspect?
<s> I guess that makes you the smart one.
<s> I'll call you tomorrow.
<s> He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
<s> How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
<s> [So you're married to him? And this looks remarkably like his brother.]
<s> [Aurillio Rosas Sanchez.]
<s> [Everything on the cellphone. We wait for calls. We have no number to call.]
<s> [Head of the anti-kidnapping division.]
<s> I don't know, but I know his face.
<s> [That's what everybody keeps saying.]
<s> Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
<s> Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
<s> Nothing wrong.
<s> Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
<s> Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.
<s> Everything happens once if you live long enough.
<s> I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital.
<s> Yes or no?
<s> Who's Emilio?
<s> Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
<s> Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.
<s> No.
<s> It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
<s> Yes.
<s> It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yeah. Two or three.
<s> Could I stop you?
<s> Frank. Frankie.
<s> You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
<s> I could do it. Remember the day you wanted the pencil? I know why. And I saw that car again. I wrote the license number in my notebook. Except I missed the last number.
<s> Dyslexic?
<s> It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
<s> The traffic takes some getting used to.
<s> It's Creasy.
<s> And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
<s> Do you know what she told me last night?
<s> Her beauty fucks with your mind.
<s> [The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
<s> We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.
<s> Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?
<s> I think it's fantastic.
<s> Why? You were so pleased with him.
<s> She's young. She'll get over it.
<s> [Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us.]
<s> [It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]
<s> [And left three more dead men.]
<s> I already ate.
<s> You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
<s> The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
<s> I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
<s> It must be one o'clock.
<s> I came to see you. How you feel?
<s> It's her baby too, you know.
<s> Well, it ain't your baby.
<s> What happen?
<s> Your son Marty?
<s> Catherine, you are a blanket of gloom. Wherever you are, the rain follows. Someday, you gonna smile, and we gonna declare a holiday.
<s> Well, the last time I was up here, that's where I sat. I sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. Now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. I'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. Then I began to cry, and I had to get up and go home.
<s> Benjamin Franklin High School.
<s> It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
<s> I really should get home, I told my father... Well, I suppose a little while longer. I wonder if there's any place around here I could put some makeup on...
<s> Nothing.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Okay.
<s> Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
<s> I'll see you around.
<s> Oh, no! She died right in the hospital...
<s> Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy he can write.
<s> Sure. Thanks a lot about my mother. We'll work out some arrangement, because naturally I want to pay...
<s> No, listen, that's my mother, I'm gonna pay for her...
<s> Well, you see, Thomas I figure the big problem is the supermarkets. But Patsy's shop, that's a specialized trade. The supermarkets don't carry Italian meat.
<s> I'm coming home right now, Ma. I'll be home in about two minutes. Tell Thomas stick around, I wanna see him about something.
<s> I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house.
<s> Tomatoes.
<s> Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.
<s> I offered her, Ma, she don't want nothing.
<s> Sure.
<s> You want a beer, Ang'?
<s> Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
<s> This is a good deal here, Marty.
<s> Siddown, Thomas, siddown.
<s> Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
<s> I don't care about the intention. I just know your Cross Action is a plus on our side. I've seen it come through four times.
<s> Well, sure, but I'm also worried about Walt Waldowski – Painless. His poker players got in an argument and asked him for a ruling, and he said what difference did it make, it was just a card game.
<s> You talked to Walt?
<s> You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
<s> I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
<s> What the hell's going on here?
<s> What's there to do? You found the sliver.
<s> Duke Forrest.
<s> Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
<s> Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
<s> C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
<s> Call Dago Red.
<s> We could steal one of the choppers.
<s> We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
<s> It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
<s> Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
<s> And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
<s> Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
<s> But what about Major Houlihan?
<s> You willing to b-back that up with odds?
<s> An eternal damnation.
<s> As far as the greens maybe. I don't know if my putting would come back or not, without some practice.
<s> Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
<s> Like the Rock of Gibraltar.
<s> Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
<s> On account he got caught in the doctor draft. He was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the Eagles signed him.
<s> Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
<s> It isn't always this rough?
<s> For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
<s> You have a certain modest charm yourself.
<s> Of course not.
<s> Maria...
<s> A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.
<s> Precisely, Maria. Tonight you have the same privilege that comes on rare occasions to the chief executive of some state or nation... the privilege of restoring life, by one tender act of mercy, to a doomed fellow creature.
<s> Excuse me, Sergeant.
<s> Let's get his clothes off quick.
<s> There's only one worth noticing.
<s> Homosexuality.
<s> Just in dreams?
<s> You guys got any black capsules?
<s> Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
<s> Now I'll have to wait at least a week. If I announced it tomorrow, after what our new Chief Nurse saw this afternoon, they'd hear her yelling from Seoul to Washington.
<s> You got to relax, Henry. Since the deluge started, you been working in the OR and running the outfit, too.
<s> I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. We try to remember we're a military organization.
<s> Yes, sir, I'll see if I can reach General Hammond in Seoul for you. You think he'll finally break down and give us two more surgeons?
<s> Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
<s> Oh, get out of here!
<s> Morning, Captain.
<s> Captain...  'This kid' is a prisoner of war.
<s> Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
<s> He likes you well enough to stick around.
<s> With all of it?
<s> Oh, yuh did, huh?
<s> Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied—
<s> Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.
<s> Hello.
<s> Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
<s> No, thank you.
<s> Money.
<s> A hundred dollars!
<s> How do you do.
<s> Go ahead, open it, open it.
<s> Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the house—and then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and—
<s> Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
<s> Well, you're catching on.
<s> Anybody! Er, er—Beany'll do!
<s> Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
<s> Oh!
<s> Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
<s> I ain't seen him for a week.
<s> Shut up!
<s> Both of 'em?
<s> Go on, go on, go on. And we'll be at Jim's Bar up the street.
<s> The heelots!
<s> Stop worrying, Colonel. I'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this.
<s> I seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account!
<s> The elevators are still runnin'.
<s> I think maybe you'd better. And Connell—I'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars.
<s> That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. "Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up.  Oh, Ned!
<s> Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.
<s> Let go of me!  This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so!  Do you deny that?
<s> I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
<s> And another thing, what about all the kids in the country, the kids that idolize ball players? What are they gonna think about you?  Close shot: Of the COLONEL. He has dropped his glove—flopped into a chair—and has taken out his ocarina.
<s> Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
<s> We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
<s> Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
<s> Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
<s> It's Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the San Francisco Police Department.
<s> Of course.
<s> What happened, Mike.
<s> Is that where you're family lives?
<s> Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
<s> Automatic.
<s> Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
<s> Being faxed over now.
<s> You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
<s> If you say so.
<s> I've rarely shot anyone.
<s> A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
<s> I don't really like to drink.
<s> She grow up in Livingtston, too?
<s> I think so.
<s> So what do I say to this guy?
<s> I have two words for you... Seek help.
<s> I do.
<s> Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
<s> That's okay. That's his style.
<s> He'll be running at the quarter pole.
<s> Yeah, first and second.
<s> Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
<s> Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
<s> Can I come in?
<s> You got a bet on the game tonight?
<s> No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
<s> Yeah that's it.
<s> Scottie...
<s> It's okay. We broke up.
<s> ...Let me just show you.
<s> In Europe women find older men very sexy.
<s> Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
<s> I'm en route. E.T.A. in five.
<s> What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
<s> Okay, I think I could swing that.
<s> Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
<s> Okay...
<s> No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.
<s> There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
<s> Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
<s> -- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
<s> Only up there in the dream they called life.
<s> It's his nature.
<s> Who?
<s> Of course the legend would like to think that.  But no one has keys.  Your maze was run.
<s> Someone sends the kid a copy of the access program, then runs the maze at the same time the kid does, using the same codes.
<s> -- He won't.
<s> That's right.
<s> Why would I do that?
<s> Then where is she?
<s> -- Katie.
<s> Who are you?!
<s> Yes.
<s> The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...
<s> ... Let's take a look over there.
<s> Everybody hold on tight.  We're gonna send this sucker into OBLIVION!
<s> Don't lose hope yet, Alpha!
<s> Ryan's Comet!!
<s> Couldn''t stand them -- low-class all the way.  And did you catch a whiff of their BREATH?!  It's like having a conversation with a couple of ONIONS!  Not to mention...
<s> You want me to place a few calls?
<s> Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that.  Not to worry.  I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils!  And what better way to entice them ... than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!
<s> Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.
<s> Quack like a'duck!
<s> You forgot to say 'Simon says."
<s> You know boss, I'd really like to help out but I've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave--
<s> And I am the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky!
<s> Charlie Luciano.
<s> Tell me about it.
<s> Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention.
<s> I guess I am. Just a little.
<s> Could we step outside?
<s> I cannot bear to look at that hideous suit one minute more.
<s> You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
<s> He was around...
<s> Long as Charlie says.
<s> Ya ignorant Guinea, it's kreplach.
<s> I'm already late.
<s> Why? You're the innocent one.
<s> It always is.
<s> Without us, Masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.
<s> It'll just be a few minutes.
<s> Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
<s> Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
<s> Whatta ya mean, Boss?
<s> He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss.
<s> Look at this boy. He hardly eats. Like that fella killed Caesar.
<s> Come on, Charlie. We got business.
<s> What about the share.
<s> I don't fuck my partners.
<s> You're fuckin' crazy. You're all fuckin' crazy!
<s> Shuddup.
<s> One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
<s> Just wanted ta say hello.
<s> Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
<s> Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?
<s> Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
<s> <u>Why</u>??
<s> I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
<s> Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that piñata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
<s> Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
<s> What'll it do if they pull the plug?
<s> Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
<s> Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm <u>okay</u>. Until I can get out of here...
<s> Maybe you could talk to Death!
<s> Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in, anyway?
<s> I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
<s> Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
<s> But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
<s> He called me "Doc."
<s> What's the "bad" part?
<s> I'd better go report this...
<s> Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
<s> Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.
<s> Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
<s> Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
<s> Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
<s> We like to think so, yeah.
<s> What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
<s> Well, if you're not holding a meeting or anything.
<s> Uh-huh?
<s> I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village.  I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
<s> I'm good.
<s> Mm hmm.
<s> Oh.  You need a cappuccino.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
<s> Where's the Majority Leader?
<s> Yes! This was how I could be put out of the Senate and out of the way! They even *promised* me that if I--
<s> Never.
<s> Looks like it, but--
<s> Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
<s> Would you settle for a husband?
<s> I would cherish you--and stay sober.
<s> Who?
<s> What do I play?
<s> Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
<s> Yeah. What about the second act?
<s> They decoyed the little General off to a tea party to keep him out of the Senate.
<s> Nothing. I'm just saying--I might be able to lie, cheat, steal--and I'd still tear into a guy I saw kicking a dog. Not that *he* is, by a long shot--
<s> I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us. I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--
<s> Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
<s> I apologize.
<s> Again? Good idea.
<s> Is the wind tired out there?
<s> Yeah, I know. That's okay.
<s> You said it!
<s> Huh?
<s> Well, then, that's great! And that's a great place to leave it! It's no use *my* barging into this now and--
<s> He's a house-afire!
<s> Kid--he thinks he's talking to that mob at home, but not a line we've written--not a word he's said from that floor has gotten into that home State.
<s> Can't that wait, Hubert?
<s> I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
<s> For instance, how to run the affairs of government? No doubt my children could make this appointment *for* me-- with the greatest ease!
<s> Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
<s> You'll see those committees when we're finished!
<s> Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
<s> I *won't* send Horace Miller!
<s> I *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future!
<s> Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
<s> Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
<s> Well--that's not work, sir--that's fun.
<s> Aw--
<s> I said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--I appoint you to the United States Senate!
<s> Peter, I'm in no mood to hear childish prattle!
<s> The porter's got them. They're coming.
<s> Here--where are you running off to?
<s> Goodnight, Jeff.
<s> I will not yield, sir! This same man-- Mister Taylor--came here to offer me a place in this Senate for twenty years, if I would vote for a dam that he knew and *I* knew was a *fraud*! But if I opened my mouth against it, he promised to break me in two! And I stood here one day and tried--I *started* to open my mouth-- and it all came to pass. The long, powerful arm of Mister James Taylor reached right into this sacred chamber and took me by the scruff of the neck--
<s> I *did* see Taylor! And I was in that room!
<s> The gentleman has said repeatedly that he is speaking to the people of his State. He has been waiting, as he so fancifully puts it, for them to come marching here in droves. Would the gentleman be interested in knowing what those people have to say?
<s> No, Jeff--please--!
<s> Jefferson--
<s> Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but--  --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son.
<s> Yes--I think maybe you'd better.
<s> You *couldn't*?
<s> Punch?
<s> Oh, just a day--
<s> Why?
<s> It *is* not!
<s> One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?
<s> Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
<s> *Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
<s> Are you drunk?
<s> But--I've done everything I--
<s> Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man they ought to be listening to! Come on!
<s> If you thought as much of being honest-- as you do of being smart--!
<s> Wonderful!
<s> You're not going to take your *suit* off!
<s> Mr. President--I stand guilty as *framed*! Because Section Forty is graft, and I was ready to say so. I was ready to tell you that one man in my state--Mister James Taylor-- was putting that dam through for his own profit!
<s> A Bill! Not *him*!
<s> Fine thing Jim Taylor wished on me-- show him the monuments--I need this job like I need ten pounds.
<s> Here, I'll take a dozen of those things. Miss Paine.
<s> I've got 'im, Joe. Be right along.
<s> Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
<s> Hey--I wanna *scoop*!
<s> What do you mean?
<s> --in other words, Jim--with this Willet Creek Dam on the fire--the man who goes to the Senate now in Sam Foley's place can't ask any questions or talk out of turn. We must be absolutely sure of him.
<s> How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?
<s> Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
<s> *I* know what I'm doing! I'll say what I *want*!
<s> Such pretty knees for a big boy!
<s> Senator Paine.
<s> It was *I* who rose in this Chamber to accuse him. He is saying that I was carrying out criminal orders on falsified evidence--
<s> Page boys!
<s> Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Deeds.
<s> Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic. You won't have no trouble at all. Talk to anybody.
<s> Oh yes, pixilated.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Oh, yes - he's pixilated all right.
<s> Always.
<s> Would you like to go for a walk?
<s> Yes!
<s> Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .
<s> I enjoy it.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Nothing—
<s> You have?
<s> He did? I play the tuba—
<s> No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.
<s> Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
<s> Oh, I wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. So I threw them out!
<s> Don't be ridiculous.
<s> Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
<s> With pay!
<s> I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
<s> Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
<s> Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney—
<s> Are you sure this is the town he lives in?
<s> I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.
<s> How do you do.
<s> Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
<s> Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
<s> Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
<s> Yes, indeed. I wonder why he left me all that money? I don't need it.
<s> Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
<s> Oh, they insisted on following me.
<s> They can have the Estate.
<s> Me?!
<s> Let me alone!  If you know what's good for you - you'll let me get this off my chest!  How did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse?  Get a kick out of it, huh? Got a big laugh?  Did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings! No!
<s> Yes. Your uncle's common-law wife. She has a legal claim on the estate.
<s> What kind of wife did you say she was?
<s> One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
<s> Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
<s> Don't pay any attention to her.
<s> I don't care how much it is. You sit right there and eat your lunch. You haven't touched a thing.
<s> South Dakota north.
<s> Yeah. What?
<s> Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.
<s> Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
<s> Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
<s> That was something I was never able to find out, sir.
<s> I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
<s> But how'll I put on the slipper, sir?
<s> Really? You think so?
<s> One hundred books?
<s> You must have been concerned.
<s> Take your time.
<s> What's that?
<s> Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
<s> Not any more.
<s> I don't want to hear any more today.
<s> Henry!
<s> There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have --
<s> My pleasure.
<s> No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
<s> Okay.
<s> Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.
<s> Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea?
<s> You're good.
<s> Is she a friend of yours?
<s> Martin.
<s> Insane! Didn't ja hear? My family got five hundred times better.  Let's go, Vanessa.
<s> I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.
<s> You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
<s> Sorry... I'm done.
<s> Be specific.
<s> No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so.
<s> Either one.
<s> I'm glad.
<s> Hello.
<s> What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook?
<s> Which show was that?
<s> Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
<s> Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
<s> But...
<s> Why do you think you tell me, Nessa?
<s> It's called pro bono.
<s> Don't you like this?
<s> Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
<s> I wondered what happened to her...
<s> Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday...
<s> It's just a thought.
<s> You don't think I'm insane?
<s> Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
<s> "Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
<s> You want my advice? Far out!
<s> What'd I do?
<s> Wow.
<s> I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
<s> Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
<s> I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
<s> I've had worse.
<s> Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
<s> What does he want the book for?
<s> -- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
<s> You will not believe it.
<s> -- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
<s> Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
<s> Water turning to blood.
<s> Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.
<s> To be hanged.
<s> I am an English woman.
<s> Proceed!
<s> Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
<s> No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
<s> Because that's where I found it. I was there.
<s> If you call that a kiss.
<s> And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right?
<s> Preparation for what?
<s> And what is that?
<s> You dream about dead guys?
<s> No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still...
<s> The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.
<s> We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.
<s> There goes that belief again. Not me, I am outta here!
<s> You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
<s> The creature!? Are you sure!?
<s> Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original.
<s> Oh no, not another worthless trinket, Jonathan, if I bring one more piece of junk to the Curator to try and sell for you.
<s> Shut-up and get me off of here!
<s> And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back
<s> I know you knew I'd know.
<s> Except for one little thing.
<s> Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
<s> Your mind is so slippery.
<s> Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.
<s> Let's do it.
<s> Hello?
<s> Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --
<s> Ummm.
<s> They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!
<s> Just a waitress.
<s> Why not?
<s> Me.
<s> I'm not that kind of girl.
<s> I saw him walk you home.
<s> Or you'll what? CAN ME?
<s> I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
<s> It's home.
<s> Me, too.
<s> Are you nuts? Get out of there!
<s> I just know.
<s> Good or evil, what's the difference?
<s> The wise snake coils before he strikes.
<s> He is in love. His anger is gone.
<s> We had an off night, that's all.
<s> How could I see him if he's invisible?
<s> Oh shut up.
<s> Yes.
<s> And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
<s> Ever since you were a little boy...  Come with me.
<s> Definitely.
<s> Whatever our name is.
<s> I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
<s> For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
<s> Yes, General Kutusov, I daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length.  Napoleon would simply spend the winter in Moscow and continue the campaign in the spring.  Another lesser possibility might be to march on St. Petersburg now, although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this, until he refits his army.
<s> Ah, yes -- proceed.
<s> Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
<s> Where are they?
<s> It is a terrible shock.
<s> Bertrand, sire.
<s> No, sire... I was asleep.
<s> To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure.  I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose.  Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?
<s> What is that?
<s> He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
<s> You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
<s> I very much doubt that he will.
<s> Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.
<s> Is it a nice warm room, sir?
<s> You must not act impetuously.
<s> Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
<s> Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
<s> All right -- I promise.
<s> I know what you're doing in there.
<s> What are you doing in there?
<s> Yes.
<s> Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.
<s> Yes, yes, please sit down.  I will be with you in a moment.
<s> I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
<s> Yes?
<s> Yes.
<s> I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
<s> You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.
<s> That is correct.
<s> Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
<s> That is a matter of opinion.
<s> My mother has always loved me.  She would do anything for me.
<s> Don't move me.
<s> Ain't the rest room this way?  I gotta pee.
<s> I'll do it.
<s> That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.
<s> Black magic.
<s> I know, be still.
<s> I can't taste nothing.
<s> That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
<s> You already in.
<s> Sorry about today, man.
<s> I didn't see nothing.
<s> It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look.
<s> Better sooner than later.
<s> It's locked.
<s> Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
<s> Well bring yo' ass on...
<s> I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!
<s> All damn.
<s> Yeah, it was.  How you get up here?
<s> Negative...they vamped.
<s> Where's Craig?
<s> I don't know.
<s> 20 minutes?
<s> I know.  I'm sorry.
<s> Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that.
<s> Keep pushing.
<s> What?
<s> Shut yo' ass up.
<s> What's the matter?
<s> Oooh, ba-by!
<s> Elroy.
<s> Oh, yeah?
<s> I...
<s> Of course.  I wish everything were that easy.
<s> I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect?
<s> Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
<s> What?
<s> I'd like to know what...
<s> Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
<s> At one thirty my little girl is dead.
<s> Where did you get these? Who are you?
<s> The gun...
<s> Then I have time for a drink.
<s> Me?
<s> That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved.
<s> Let me talk to her again.
<s> Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.
<s> I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor.
<s> Keep it.
<s> Keep it.
<s> Oh, man...
<s> One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.
<s> No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
<s> It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
<s> I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
<s> What are you going to do?
<s> No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
<s> You worthless piece of shit! Gimme that!
<s> Gimme a dollar.
<s> It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
<s> Everybody does?
<s> You're a big girl, huh?
<s> A surprise?
<s> Only you.
<s> Do it!
<s> That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
<s> Keep talkin', Preacher.
<s> Keep talkin', Preacher.
<s> How's your sister Pearl?
<s> Don't!
<s> Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
<s> I thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
<s> Bluebeard!
<s> You ain't leavin' in no hurry if we can help it!
<s> Satan.
<s> How?
<s> What!
<s> Once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in Africa. Well, one day this King got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --
<s> Somewheres. I don't know yet.
<s> Hush, Pearl. Come on.
<s> Ssh...
<s> Dead.
<s> You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
<s> Nothin'!
<s> No. No.
<s> NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
<s> Don't you believe me?
<s> Under the stone in the floor.
<s> Yes?
<s> What's your name?
<s> Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
<s> Why, sure. And there's fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!
<s> Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
<s> Will you buy me a choclit sody?
<s> A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
<s> Yes.
<s> Where's she at?
<s> What's wrong, John?
<s> When did I ever?
<s> Now who was this?
<s> Glen. Not now. I mean, we're here for Tina now, not for ourselves.
<s> Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?
<s> Slept like a rock.
<s> Uh-oh...
<s> Just checking -- keep out of sight!
<s> Don't ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when I bring him out.
<s> Okay. Hi, dad.
<s> Hi daddy. I know what happened.
<s> Nan, I --
<s> It wasn't that serious...
<s> I will.
<s> Nancy!
<s> They say you've bottomed out when you can't remember the night before.  No more drinking, Baby, suddenly I just don't feel like it any more.
<s> How the fuck do I know?  I don't expect you to believe me.
<s> Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
<s> I mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time. But invisible razors. She just... opened up...
<s> No.
<s> Forget it, the point is, everybody has nightmares once in a while. No biggy.
<s> Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.
<s> Have you any money?
<s> You should be more careful, Anna.
<s> About what?
<s> As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
<s> And there?
<s> They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.
<s> Positively not!
<s> That's right.
<s> If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
<s> I know, but if we can't put in all these wonderful things at least let's put in some imagination.  In that one omelet we'll taste the whole of Paris!
<s> Right now it's on the balcony.
<s> They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
<s> We like you, Leon -- don't we like Leon?
<s> Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
<s> Very good. The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians.
<s> You didn't get legal advice?
<s> Yes, Comrade?
<s> Leon... Leonitchka...  Why are you so good to us? 
<s> Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.
<s> Shall I draw your bath, sir?
<s> I don't feel like any breakfast.
<s> Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
<s> May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
<s> Emphatically not, sir. The prospect terrifies me. Now, don't misunderstand me, sir, I don't resent your not paying me for the past two months, but the thought that I should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me.
<s> Yes.
<s> If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times."
<s> These may have been the jewels of the Duchess Swana, but, like all private property, they were confiscated by the State.
<s> I give you my word! They were confiscated legally!
<s> How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
<s> Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
<s> But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
<s> Razinin.
<s> What did she say about me?
<s> Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
<s> Yes, Comrade.
<s> Well, we're back home.
<s> Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
<s> The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
<s> No visa.
<s> You're going to force us... huh?
<s> Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> That's a strange angle.
<s> And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
<s> It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
<s> Well, let's say I live in it. Such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway...
<s> I will do my best.
<s> No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
<s> I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.
<s> Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Wounded? How?
<s> That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
<s> It's false sentimentality.
<s> I kissed the Polish lancer too... before he died.
<s> Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
<s> A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
<s> Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative?
<s> You must, darling.
<s> No speech?
<s> No. Nobody will find us.
<s> All right, we'll make it red.
<s> No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?
<s> But I can throw it out of the window.
<s> It is their wish.
<s> You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
<s> A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
<s> Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!
<s> That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her.  She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.
<s> A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm afraid madame and I will never agree.  The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. I understand everything will be over by Thursday. Am I right?
<s> Yes.
<s> Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
<s> Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little château in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
<s> Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.
<s> What?
<s> Of course not, my dear! I didn't come here with any such suspicion. How ridiculous!  Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.
<s> Please come to the point. What is it you want?
<s> We have nothing to discuss.
<s> Go on.
<s> Yes, it does.
<s> May I ask why?
<s> Yes... leaving immediately.
<s> That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
<s> Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.
<s> I like that.  That's a solution.
<s> No, we have nothing to hide.
<s> Good.  You know how I feel about loyalty.  I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail.  That I promise you.  The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John.  I have complete confidence in you.
<s> In Richard Nixon's long history of underhanded dealings, he has never gotten better value for his money.  If I were to open my mouth, all the dominoes would fall.
<s> That's not the question, John.  The question is: Why is he paying?
<s> Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.
<s> He left his White House phone number in his hotel room.
<s> Well, he's photogenic.  Let's try dog bones?
<s> The hard-core four million "Nixon nuts" aren't gonna go for it ... They'll say I sold out to the Communists.
<s> Damn right.  And there's still a helluva lotta people out there who wanna believe ... That's the point, isn't it?  They wanna believe in the President.
<s> 'Night, Al.
<s> This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.
<s> He's completely lost touch with reality.
<s> That's right ...
<s> Evidently to install bugs and photograph documents.
<s> What's Liddy got?
<s> Howard Hunt is working for the White House?  No shit!  This is goddamn Disneyland!  Since when?
<s> Definitely.  Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature.
<s> That's right, and it's more a problem for Ehrlichman.  He fixed Hunt up with the phony CIA ID's, but ... what else does Hunt have on us?
<s> The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
<s> Dick, you don't have to make a statement.  Herb covered it for you.
<s> Because he didn't even know about it. The CIA never told him, they just kept it going.  It was like ... it had a life of its own.  Like ... a kind of "beast" that doesn't even know it exists.  It just eats people when it doesn't need 'em anymore.  Two days after the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy called me in.  He reamed my ass ...
<s> Don't forget, the most important thing in your life is your relationship with your Maker ...  Don't forget to be on God's side.
<s> It's Helms -- it's got to be.
<s> How?
<s> Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
<s> Why me?
<s> Yes ... It involves some old and forgotten papers.  Things I signed as Vice President.  I want the originals in my office and I don't want copies anywhere else.
<s> I'm not Jack Kennedy.  Your agency is secure.
<s> Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
<s> Johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office.
<s> No one.  Your property.  It would prove your case.  Why do you think Kissinger's taping your calls?  For history.  His word against yours -- and right now he's got the records.
<s> She's quite pretty.
<s> Agreed.
<s> Well, goddamn.  Are you threatening me, Dick?
<s> He's turned into a drug fiend, he shot people from helicopters in Vietnam, he has sexual relations with his wife in front of their children.  He sees a shrink in L.A.  He's all fucked up. Now he's trying to be a hero to the liberals ... If he gets away with it, everybody will follow his lead.  He must be stopped at all costs.
<s> How a fat man gets so many girls.
<s> Free, if you're the president.
<s> Hello ...
<s> She must be very attractive.  Would she like an autograph?  She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
<s> I know.  I know.  I've seen a lot of kids die, too, in World War II.
<s> There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ...
<s> Sir?
<s> You know how much money he had in the bank when he died?  Nothing.  He was so damned honest ...  But I miss him.  I miss him a hell of a lot.
<s> I want a divorce.
<s> You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ...
<s> I don't want them to love me.
<s> Will you ... would you kiss me?
<s> You're drunk!
<s> Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
<s> Sounds like you got a crisis syndrome. Aren't you exaggerating a bit, Dick? Call it three-and-a-half, maybe four ...
<s> The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
<s> Got a letter from your wife. She writes pretty regular, tells me the family news.
<s> In Angola. Yeah.
<s> When did he die?
<s> No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
<s> Most don't.
<s> If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.
<s> Strolls right back into a crime scene. Who would do such a thing? How do you defend against it?
<s> Would you tell me if you had?
<s> Some pretty bad people.
<s> That's possible.
<s> Gun out and up.
<s> I don't know. He ought to...
<s> No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.
<s> Natural to the line of work they was in.
<s> Yes Sheriff.
<s> Hyah!
<s> I always am.
<s> Well. If you say so.
<s> Lord no. I'm not retired.
<s> I don't know. Had dreams.
<s> Well they always is to the party concerned.
<s> I ain't got the money.
<s> No. I found it.
<s> I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.
<s> Where does he work?
<s> In the truck.  I'll get it.
<s> You know who it is.
<s> Yeah I'm goin' to bring you somethin' all right. I've decided to make you a special project of mine. You ain't goin' to have to look for me at all.
<s> Sixty-nine cent.
<s> I don't have some way to put it. That's the way it is.
<s> For what?
<s> Well -- we need to know what it is we're callin' for here.
<s> ...Where you want me to put it?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store?
<s> Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it.
<s> I'm just one person. Don't matter the size of the bed.
<s> That's got two double beds.
<s> I know what it is. He won't find me again.
<s> I been immobile.
<s> I'm retired.
<s> No sir.
<s> No sir. I'm a veteran.
<s> I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
<s> Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
<s> No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Anyway, so what?
<s> No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
<s> They're fine... you miss it?
<s> This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
<s> No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
<s> I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband...
<s> ...to see you.
<s> "Thirty-two?"
<s> It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
<s> Oh, Betty --
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
<s> I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.
<s> I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
<s> ...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
<s> Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
<s> David, please --
<s> ...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
<s> Nothing... it's, ahh, busy here. Look, you don't need a LeSabre to go out with Sue Ann. Take the blue Corsica. I'll see you when I get home.
<s> It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
<s> I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
<s> Make sure it's elevated...
<s> Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
<s> Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...
<s> That's horrible!
<s> Really?
<s> Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
<s> I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
<s> Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
<s> God, that's awful!
<s> Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
<s> You said in L.A., anything goes.
<s> Who?
<s> This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid.
<s> Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
<s> Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there...
<s> We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
<s> Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
<s> Ahh... my wife's.
<s> Hell of a way to die.
<s> Well, why'd you shoot him?
<s> Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
<s> ...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
<s> ...among others.
<s> Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was.
<s> Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
<s> It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
<s> Half.
<s> I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
<s> We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
<s> Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman...
<s> Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
<s> "It's beneath her..." She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
<s> It just didn't fit her profile...
<s> ...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
<s> Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
<s> What's wrong with you?
<s> Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.
<s> You better believe it.
<s> I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
<s> Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...
<s> I don't know, George...
<s> I said I'll think about it.
<s> I SAID FORGET IT!
<s> ...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
<s> The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
<s> I swear to God!
<s> No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
<s> No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
<s> Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
<s> Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
<s> You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.
<s> Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!
<s> Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
<s> Boys, we was chained together. I hadda tell ya somethin'. Bustin' out alone was not a option!
<s> Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just -
<s> Oh, yes, assa parful new force.
<s> Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
<s> Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
<s> Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
<s> That's good, honey.
<s> You said -
<s> Well, we need that ring.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> You didn't know that at the time!
<s> Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.  And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
<s> I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
<s> He ain't our daddy!
<s> Great.
<s> Nobody. It just came to me.
<s> Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
<s> What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
<s> Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
<s> Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
<s> Come over here where I can see you.
<s> A long time ago.
<s> No, sir!
<s> No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
<s> I'm doing okay, sir.
<s> Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
<s> That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
<s> What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
<s> It's important, sir!
<s> How're you doing, Sarge?
<s> No.
<s> Fall out on the lawn in five minutes, in your Poopie suits!
<s> Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
<s> What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
<s> What?
<s> I haven't made up my mind.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
<s> Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
<s> I know who you are and what you want.
<s> What's stopping you?
<s> Yeah, then if I get jets, it's on to Beeville, Texas.
<s> Twenty-two years ago.
<s> I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
<s> So?
<s> Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!
<s> Who's got two bucks? It's costing me every penny they pay us just to keep my old Lady and my kids in that motel.
<s> Sorry, pard. Wouldn't want you to get an honor violation.
<s> Foley's not poor. Buddy of mine in oh-four told me he's the son of a rich doctor down in Louisiana.
<s> I've seen better.
<s> A little.
<s> You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
<s> Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
<s> I don't want Raoul to administrate that part.
<s> Who's the clown now?  Huh?!  Who's the fucking clown now?!
<s> That's right.
<s> I can't...
<s> This is ridiculous...
<s> Keep your voice down.
<s> She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
<s> Shut up.
<s> Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room.
<s> Do me a favor and don't talk.
<s> You wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the morning and then tell me I look like hell?  Of course I look like hell, you don't look so hot yourself, Jack.  I'm freezing here, thank you for checking, can I go?
<s> Don't!
<s> If you think I'm gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of --
<s> He puts his hands on me again I'll bury a slug in his ear.
<s> Nobody leaves.
<s> Open the door.
<s> The crowd goes wild.
<s> They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
<s> Give me a break.
<s> I'm here.  I'm here.
<s> "Titanic."
<s> No.
<s> Huh uh.
<s> Fuck that, we've got company...
<s> They are carrying guns. They are threatening police officers. They are undermining the United States of America. And you Inspector Brimmer are not taking your duties seriously...
<s> Like, you Inspector Brimmer are not going to be sitting in your car anymore. I think it's time for a more active type of involvement.
<s> Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.
<s> Brimmer you're fucked up...
<s> Shit, I ain't doing nothing. White bread asks for cocaine, I take his money. Shit... you know... It was just a hustle.
<s> I don't know. Look around man.
<s> Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out.
<s> Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
<s> You talk as if this thing's already been decided.
<s> Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.
<s> We need money first...
<s> Where you been? I saw the cops rousting you at the rally.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Yeah... let me think about it.
<s> I'm down.
<s> They were empty...
<s> Bullshit...
<s> No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
<s> Not at all.  I'll catch you later.
<s> Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
<s> Thank you.
<s> His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness.
<s> No, he takes after his mother...
<s> He's my father.
<s> I'll leave in the morning with Gabriel.
<s> I said, I'm not my sister.
<s> With a lace table cloth?
<s> I consider them linked.
<s> I understand, sir.
<s> Is that so?
<s> No...
<s> As you did at Fort Wilderness?
<s> Yes, I do.  I hate him and I hope he never comes back.
<s> Please.
<s> I stand corrected.
<s> You said bribery twice...
<s> That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.
<s> I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.
<s> I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
<s> Long time.
<s> They're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard.  They'd be better off letting it move on.
<s> Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
<s> For what?
<s> About a hundred and twenty.  Less than a third.
<s> He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
<s> Thank you.  Did you finish the upper field?
<s> Bite?
<s> But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?
<s> I will. Come and kiss me.
<s> For a little while.
<s> Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
<s> Allman Brothers.
<s> Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
<s> Why? For God's sake, why?
<s> Don't worry about that.
<s> Wouldn't wash?
<s> I guess it wouldn't hurt.
<s> Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back.
<s> Yes.
<s> No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie.
<s> The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
<s> Come on--let's parole 'em.
<s> Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
<s> Did you see his shirt?
<s> It's beautiful!
<s> She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
<s> Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her.
<s> You'll get it back.  Or one better.
<s> Elizabeth goes free!
<s> And Jack.  And the crew.  Free and unharmed.  If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you.
<s> Say the name, or I slit your throat.
<s> You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
<s> That's right.
<s> Bosun!  Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig.  Meaning no disrespect, of course.
<s> The last time you do this, you left me a pistol, with one shot.
<s> What're you suggesting?
<s> Men!  Are you up for it?
<s> Can I trust you?
<s> He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
<s> Or, rather, Commodore Norrington ... a fine gentleman, don't you think?  He fancies you, you know.
<s> If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
<s> Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.
<s> A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!
<s> Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
<s> Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea?
<s> Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
<s> You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
<s> As likely as not.  Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!
<s> Smith.
<s> Why ask me?
<s> Agreed!
<s> My father.  William Turner?
<s> That's not true.
<s> He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
<s> Oh -- did I forget to mention that?
<s> The pistol.  When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot.  No good for hunting, or surviving, really.  But after three weeks of starvation and thrist -- the option of that pistol begins to look good.
<s> If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
<s> My apologies, Governor.
<s> A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal.  He'll sleep, that's all.
<s> Yeah, I'm going to finish what you started --
<s> You're not rotting meat.
<s> You're right.  Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.
<s> Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.
<s> That might work.
<s> Wait, wait, can I at least have his body?
<s> Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
<s> Oh yeah.  They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
<s> They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
<s> You're looking for a urine sample.
<s> Because I am a new man, Susan.  I am a man of vision.  Your problem, Susan, is that you're always looking down.  If you'd just look up you'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost.  They focus on what can be gained.
<s> No!  Well, not those exact words.
<s> Make me?  How?  You think he's going to torture me?
<s> Yes.  That's it.  He's got it.  Oh God, he's got it!
<s> Wellie well, Dr. Bright.  You're just in time.
<s> What?  No kiss?  Not even for old times sake?
<s> Is that so?
<s> We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.
<s> Yes.
<s> Once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure.
<s> The waste.
<s> With enough exposure, the same thing they do to everything else.
<s> Just giving credit where credit is due.
<s> Blame the victim.
<s> I'm not leaving without you, Susan!
<s> And you have him?
<s> 'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
<s> Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
<s> Goodbye, Stew—
<s> Certainly. Right over there.
<s> Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning, I got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand.
<s> I'm not interested. Smythe will open the door.
<s> For what?
<s> It isn't cheap. It's nice.
<s> Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
<s> That's exactly what you mean. Heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of it. I've given you party after party - I've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful? No! You insult them and act like a bore. I'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you've done. Perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you, and what you're going to do.
<s> Your house?
<s> Oh, hello Mother!
<s> Thanks, I will.
<s> Oh, man!
<s> Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted to see how the old newshound looked made up for a gentleman.
<s> I'll bite. What's the catch?
<s> It isn't a question of knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get in one that counts.
<s> Well - it's only April.
<s> Do you call yourself a reporter?
<s> That's so.
<s> Sure.
<s> Now Mr. Smith, now please—
<s> I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social secretary.
<s> Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?
<s> It's the smoke.
<s> Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
<s> Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
<s> Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
<s> Nothing.
<s> I dyed one and washed the other.
<s> Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
<s> Conrad.
<s> Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
<s> It'll be ready in a minute.
<s> The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
<s> Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
<s> Hello, Joe.
<s> All right, Grandma—
<s> To engage in a brawl! A cheap, common brawl, in my own home! "I wear the pants!" The pants ! Not even the trousers!
<s> I understand, sir.
<s> Now the lady said you may go—
<s> I just putter.
<s> Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
<s> How about me?  Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
<s> Yes.
<s> What?
<s> How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
<s> Sure.
<s> Yes she is.
<s> But I really should get home.
<s> Yeah. It does.
<s> I was in a bowling-alley.
<s> Um ... It's ...
<s> Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me.
<s> You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
<s> Oh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you want to.
<s> So.
<s> It's better, Mary Sue.
<s> Okay, that's IT!!!
<s> No it couldn't!
<s> I'm fine--but thank you.
<s> "Changes."
<s> Oh sure ... You bet.  Betty ...
<s> Yes I do.
<s> You're not allowed to lie.
<s> But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
<s> Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
<s> What happened?
<s> As a matter of fact he does.
<s> What?
<s> Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
<s> Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other?
<s> Well if I don't who will?
<s> Nothing.
<s> Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
<s> Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...  ... it's not just the sex ...
<s> I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
<s> Honestly ... no.
<s> Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...
<s> Do they have those ... Where you come from?
<s> Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
<s> Nice ... Nice ...
<s> Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. It's free.
<s> Because we don't belong!
<s> I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
<s> What?
<s> ... Yeah.
<s> Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
<s> Yeah ...
<s> Thanks.  But this morning I was thinking about it and I realized that I looked forward to it all year. And then I thought "Gee. That seems awfully silly. That seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?"
<s> I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ...
<s> You're gonna keep painting aren't you?
<s> TV repair?
<s> This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
<s> Yeah. 
<s> There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
<s> So it's ok if I bring her.
<s> No.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Yeah I can't.
<s> It's fine, but --
<s> I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
<s> I have no idea.
<s> -- all I want is the number of where she's staying and that should be god damn good enough, now stop treating me this way, please -- Just Give Me The Number Elizabeth Please Now I think I will kill you if you don't.
<s> This is Georgia.
<s> I don't lie, Jack. I'm about 5'8, blonde 34,28,34. Pretty thin, I work out. My pussy's shaved. My friends say I'm pretty cute, so....
<s> You're going to work now?
<s> Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  Do you remember?
<s> Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
<s> This is not cool.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Yes I do.
<s> No. I'm the exact opposite --
<s> It's Barry.
<s> ...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
<s> Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
<s> That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
<s> You don't think you'll go --
<s> It's Barry.
<s> This is nice.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Can I come home with you when we get there?
<s> It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
<s> I didn't do it.
<s> Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
<s> I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
<s> You are bad. You are a bad person. you are a bad person and you have no right to take people's confidence in your service --
<s> You came all the way from Los Angeles to tell me that?
<s> We back our plungers 100% and we do ask for a 30 to 60 day display on the floor.....
<s> That was weird. I meant good.
<s> Yes I'm fine.
<s> I have to talk to you in a second about that, Lance, ok?
<s> ....I made a call.....  ....and, uh....
<s> Are you serious with this?
<s> This is a bunch of bullshit.
<s> You can't be late.
<s> You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
<s> Seriously.
<s> I thought Latisha said you would --
<s> You don't need to talk all macho, "shake him out, little bad boy." Whatever -- you're not an action hero, tough guy, you're not a gangster --
<s> No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
<s> Are you learning how to play the piano? What is that?
<s> Yeah, no, I have to get something from my car, I said.
<s> "...a poker... he took a poker from the fire..."
<s> We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.
<s> Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
<s> I've you to look after me, haven't I?
<s> By whom? The Marquis?
<s> What? What've I done?
<s> In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
<s> I'll fill page after page, I promise.
<s> But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well?
<s> Do I have your word?
<s> Honestly! You cut me to the core! What's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when I finally succumb -- when at long last, I pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion? Have you no faith in your own medicine?
<s> How can one man possibly be so selfish?
<s> His rug.
<s> Because your writing continues, unchecked.
<s> A man after my own heart...
<s> A night spent with the partner of my choice.
<s> Was it impotence?
<s> Of course.
<s> Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
<s> And place my reputation at stake?
<s> Of course.
<s> It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
<s> A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
<s> Maybe someday you'll tell me your name.
<s> What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
<s> You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
<s> They decreed me a savage, and now they have made me one.
<s> Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
<s> Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
<s> I am not a wealthy woman.
<s> Oh, but I am!
<s> It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...
<s> Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I be betrayed by every man I meet --
<s> How was I to tell you? By writing a letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE?
<s> They've put you up to this, haven't they?
<s> Very much.
<s> No, when I was but a tender lad--
<s> Not you too
<s> You need to get outta here, Rapunzel
<s> Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
<s> I'll remember that.
<s> Nothing for you to worry about, darling
<s> We are in no "pickle" -- as you would euphemistically have it.
<s> You needn't use that language with me
<s> I don't want you to--
<s> That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music--
<s> No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
<s> Image a man that has shaped his time. A titanic figure of limitless influence. Think about empire. A man with an empire at his feet. A man, like a baron, living in a palace, a glorious palace on a hill, and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath him. Feudal.
<s> I expected more from you.
<s> Don't do this
<s> I can't do it. okay?! I drink too much -- I drink all the fucking time and I don't have it anymore. All that is over for me--
<s> She was . . . innocent
<s> They don't have to.
<s> Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
<s> But it's not a great syllable
<s> Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
<s> Aw, cheer up, George'll probably be running Fox by the morning. Let's get a drink.
<s> Yeah, you're probably right.
<s> Yeah, ain't it swell?
<s> And they went to the stockholders in New York.
<s> Yes.
<s> And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.
<s> Yes
<s> Again
<s> Again
<s> Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The budget projections on this--
<s> Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about that?
<s> Happy birthday.
<s> I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place.
<s> Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
<s> You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.
<s> What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
<s> I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great.
<s> Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
<s> What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here...
<s> You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
<s> I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
<s> I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title.
<s> Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
<s> Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
<s> You want the title shot?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
<s> No, I just told you what happened.
<s> Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
<s> Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
<s> Well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in New York. And they're saying that you don't cooperate.
<s> You sound bitter.
<s> I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
<s> You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.
<s> Should I hit it?
<s> Can you see it?
<s> That's all right. He don't mind.
<s> Jake...
<s> Oh, Jake.
<s> Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to work. Paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. And Mr. Wizard here ain't no help.
<s> I am answering...
<s> I don't know what it is. I dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out.
<s> What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?
<s> Then what?
<s> Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
<s> Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
<s> Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We're just trying to have a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.
<s> Namely?
<s> Go ahead, Doyle -- tell me he's an unemployed magician -- amusing the neighborhood with sleight-of-hand.
<s> For instance?
<s> Then where is she -- in the ice box?
<s> Well -- what good is his information?!! It's a second-hand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself -- Thorwald! Anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
<s> I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
<s> By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
<s> Like an old hambone?
<s> Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
<s> Why should I?
<s> I only have a hundred dollars or so.
<s> You've got a hormone deficiency.
<s> I'm not ready for marriage.
<s> She's all right.
<s> No.
<s> Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.
<s> I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
<s> Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam
<s> That's fine, Stella. Now would you make me a sandwich?
<s> How did you know!
<s> Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
<s> Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why Thorwald killed it.
<s> And digging in.  Look at that flower bed.
<s> I have a feeling we've just begun.
<s> There's probably one in the basement.
<s> You haven't even heard from him?
<s> Goodnight, Mrs Doyle.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
<s> Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
<s> Fine. Corkscrew's on the right.
<s> For what?
<s> Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?
<s> She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
<s> There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --
<s> Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
<s> You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
<s> Of course not.
<s> Ever get shot at, run over, sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera?
<s> Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
<s> Tell me about it.
<s> Not yet!
<s> Inside stuff?
<s> Well that's fine, but I only have one bed, and --
<s> That's a suitcase?
<s> But you're not?
<s> Your name?
<s> Know the Millertown bluff?
<s> Okay.
<s> Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
<s> Hang loose.  We got all night.
<s> Hold it, Jim.
<s> How'd that happen!  What kind of trouble you in?
<s> I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
<s> You don't?
<s> Sure.  Sure.
<s> Did anyone see you there?  I mean did they get your license number or anything?
<s> He's home.  I heard the car.
<s> I still think you should go down.
<s> Where's your mother tonight, Plato?
<s> I just don't want trouble.
<s> Who knows.  Plato?
<s> We know.
<s> Man, you're schizoid!
<s> Hey!  How 'bout that!
<s> Not lately.
<s> Sure I'm sure.  Judy's waiting. You ready to come out now?
<s> Friends never break promises, do they?  Okay.  Here.  Now listen.  There are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe.  You understand that?  They said I could come in and bring you out.
<s> But you didn't hurt anybody.
<s> But you don't think that's a solution.
<s> Where what was.
<s> I'm not so bad.
<s> Neither can I.
<s> Why?
<s> Have you ever gone with anyone who--
<s> Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
<s> Yes.  My best friend.
<s> Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
<s> Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
<s> Ash, you've gotten me enough --
<s> NICK!
<s> Nick --
<s> Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
<s> Nick, the ice is --
<s> Don't say my name...
<s> Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
<s> What?
<s> I'm almost done.
<s> They all are. Football's on.
<s> We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
<s> I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick!  I -- I just wanted to be --
<s> Yes!
<s> J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
<s> Bam Bam.
<s> What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
<s> I'm gonna need some money.
<s> ...never... tried...
<s> Nick. I been trying to hit you.
<s> What's the code?
<s> We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
<s> You guys get caught, I go away for good. I got an interest in making sure you don't. You need a sixth man covering an exit. What're you gonna do about it.
<s> Six men means six guns.
<s> And where they hide the real money.
<s> Show's over.
<s> I don't know... what you're...
<s> What?
<s> Not with you.
<s> Merlin, I didn't know --
<s> Oh, man --
<s> Me and her got a connection.  Read this part. Read the part about stuffing her stocking.
<s> Shoulda written, Rudy...
<s> Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
<s> Standing right here, man!
<s> You gave them me.
<s> Well...sorry...
<s> What? No...
<s> Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy!
<s> What?
<s> Really? Who's your P.O.?
<s> That's okay, Eddie, I do.
<s> What? Nobody set anybody up.
<s> Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up.
<s> ...What bar?
<s> The Milwaukee Brewers?
<s> It's like a joke. You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own. The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it.
<s> The things you gotta remember are the details. It's the details that sell your story. Now this story takes place in this men's room. So you gotta know the details about this men's room. You gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands. You gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors. You gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it. And if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you.
<s> He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
<s> I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed me...
<s> Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house.
<s> It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that.
<s> Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
<s> Why am I Mr. Pink?
<s> What do you care?
<s> He don't tip.
<s> He don't believe in it.
<s> Nope.
<s> That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
<s> You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
<s> Down to my car.
<s> It's a surprise.
<s> Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a look at the little surprise I brought you.
<s> No, I'm not!
<s> Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.
<s> Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
<s> That's not correct.
<s> Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
<s> Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.
<s> How can you be so sure?
<s> Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
<s> Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here.
<s> He asked.
<s> That fuckin did it!
<s> Enough! You better start talkin' to us, asshole, cause we got shit we need to talk about. We're already freaked out, we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.
<s> There's a slight difference.
<s> Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
<s> Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.
<s> In the grub box.  Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
<s> I suppose it is.
<s> Will she be dark or fair?
<s> Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.
<s> Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.
<s> Hurry up.
<s> Maybe they will.
<s> Hello, Miss Wells.
<s> You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
<s> Morgan blood. The beat in Nevada. Clay and me have a place on the Toulomne River. We're going to raise horses like these.
<s> Swimming.
<s> That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
<s> I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
<s> You better start.
<s> That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life.
<s> You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
<s> Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
<s> There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
<s> Just a thing I was workin' on.
<s> I like it.
<s> Plenty more.  And somewhere up there's the lode, the rock rotten with it.
<s> There aren't any women here.
<s> Depends on how good you drive.
<s> I don't like to see you go.
<s> Now where's she goin'? --
<s> Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done.
<s> What's the use.
<s> Where is he?
<s> One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
<s> Since I can remember, Ma'am.
<s> From A to Z. All you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words.
<s> You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
<s> Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?
<s> But he could still be haunting the house. He's angry that he had to leave.
<s> No, stay.
<s> He's so brave.
<s> Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
<s> It looks like the furnace.
<s> Look, what I'm trying to say --
<s> That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
<s> Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
<s> This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
<s> I don't know, but I sure hope so.
<s> I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
<s> I'm glad you asked. It actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.
<s> Willing? I like that.  And, this one?
<s> What's this?
<s> They are the survivors of the Steveston County massacre.
<s> Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
<s> Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.
<s> What?
<s> My help?
<s> Alright, go to the belt store...
<s> Not unless you have a paternity test to prove it.
<s> Then let us prepare.
<s> "Fucked me."
<s> Bye, bird-brain. See ya, Scotty.
<s> Mother? 
<s> He's really cute!
<s> You said you hated him.
<s> I don't feel like rewinding it!
<s> Let me see!
<s> Oh Mom...
<s> Chip, the only cereal I know about is Rice Krispies.
<s> Suspect's family is headed east on Calverton....
<s> Don't I get a kiss?
<s> We can be real quiet...
<s> You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
<s> It was her! Beverly Sutphin! Sittin' right there!  I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!
<s> I can't say it out loud. I don't use bad language.
<s> It's not fair!!
<s> But... but... she... Rosemary, I heard her voice! It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!
<s> No, I don't.
<s> But...  I didn't wish... I didn't want him DEAD!
<s> NO! I could never hurt anyone!
<s> That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
<s> Now, here's a babe!
<s> I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
<s> You can?
<s> If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
<s> It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty.
<s> Drink.
<s> For the time being, I imagine that must do.
<s> I'll try there.
<s> She seems rather an odd woman to me.
<s> Thank you.. .goodnight.
<s> But you do believe me?
<s> I'd like that.
<s> Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -—
<s> Oh, I'm making investigations.
<s> Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
<s> You'd love that, Jackie. Remember that last summer with Mother in the Berkshires? You used to help the gardener.
<s> Not from me.
<s> I'm at sea, Jason.
<s> Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.
<s> And Gregory -- he loves her.
<s> But why come to me?
<s> I should like people to read what I've written.
<s> I'd forgotten.
<s> It seems right to us.
<s> I don't believe it.
<s> She's not been here for a long time.
<s> No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
<s> Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
<s> Yes?
<s> Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
<s> Why
<s> What about Judd -- he knows about us.
<s> Then it is decided. Leo and Durk and I will make our plans.
<s> False alarm.
<s> Oh. Well, I did. I was in a band once, and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible.
<s> What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
<s> I feel like they do.
<s> Kids? What about them?
<s> I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
<s> Agreed.
<s> You're in therapy?
<s> I believe in it for some people. I mean, for me it was silly, I was confused going in. So I just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately.
<s> That's correct.  Bit of a dilemma, isn't it?
<s> Ann. Hello.
<s> Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
<s> Videotapes.
<s> What kind of personal project?
<s> Everything about sex.
<s> Maybe you want to go.
<s> What do you have to do to get ready?
<s> Ann Bishop Millaney.
<s> At some level, I don't understand your nervousness. Have you decided to leave John?
<s> Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
<s> You're not like your sister. You couldn't be like her if you wanted to.
<s> Yes.
<s> What was the problem?
<s> How come?
<s> Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.
<s> I... I can't answer that precisely.
<s> Possibly.
<s> All right!! All right!! You want to know? You want to know how I feel? I feel ashamed. Is that what you wanted to hear?
<s> And I'm telling you it's not any one thing that I can point to and say "That's why!" It doesn't work that way with people who have problems, Ann, it's not that neat, it's not that tidy! It's not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count. Things just don't happen that way.
<s> Mmmmm...
<s> That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
<s> We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yeah, so?
<s> Yeah, I know.
<s> Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
<s> That guy Graham I told you about. He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was... well, he said a lot of stuff.
<s> He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
<s> What's wrong with that?
<s> Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
<s> Well, why?
<s> What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?
<s> What kinds of questions?
<s> You don't know that for sure.
<s> That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
<s> So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
<s> You are in serious trouble.
<s> What is it?
<s> No.
<s> Bye.
<s> So will you, someday.
<s> She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
<s> Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
<s> No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
<s> Very much live.
<s> It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
<s> Hi.
<s> I can't talk you into it?
<s> Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
<s> Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
<s> No, I mean doing it at my house.
<s> Cynthia. John.
<s> Right now.
<s> Then get those balls in the air and get your butt over here.
<s> Doesn't work. He has to know the people, he has to be able to interact with them.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Look, are we going to do it or not?
<s> You were prying before?
<s> I like having the car, the car is important.
<s> No.
<s> Yes?
<s> Was he nice to you?
<s> I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead.
<s> No. I don't think so.
<s> Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you.
<s> What do you want to call me at the office for?
<s> Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
<s> Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
<s> That you, Rog?
<s> Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
<s> YOUNG MALE INTERN, TALL AND HANDSOME

<s> BREAKING OUT
<s> I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
<s> They probably meant Irving and wanted you to swing.
<s> No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.
<s> Bert brought them over from Europe.  They had a very popular series together.  It's still rerun in a lot of countries.  You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'
<s> Really.  What'll I pin this on?
<s> SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
<s> SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR MOVEMENT
<s> Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
<s> It's...
<s> There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.
<s> Me?
<s> I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm going places.  I'm going to be someone.  I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people...
<s> What does he know about it?
<s> OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
<s> CRIMINAL
<s> SIN-I-FUL
<s> I love you.
<s> Say, is Maya working?
<s> Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.
<s> I am one of those guys.
<s> I can't help the traffic.
<s> Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
<s> 100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
<s> Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
<s> As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
<s> I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
<s> I owe her a call anyway.
<s> It's not even a mile.
<s> This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
<s> Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
<s> Shut up.
<s> Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
<s> Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
<s> Aye-aye, captain.
<s> Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
<s> Shut up. Shut your face.
<s> We were supposed to play golf.
<s> Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
<s> Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
<s> What? Of course I like Christine.
<s> She's working. I need a break anyway. She's getting a little clingy.  This is our day!
<s> Nope.
<s> Could be anything.
<s> Obsessively.
<s> You have to tell me --
<s> He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
<s> Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
<s> I don't have to.
<s> No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.  I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
<s> Thanks.
<s> I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What's that?
<s> I don't know. I wouldn't know.
<s> Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed trout.
<s> Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.
<s> Quite a week.
<s> I'm fine. You rest.
<s> Nothing. Buckle up, okay?
<s> Whatever. Sorry.
<s> A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
<s> I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
<s> Hey.
<s> Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs.  Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want?
<s> Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc.
<s> Yeah. Thanks.
<s> I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
<s> Good. So did I.
<s> Great. What's the latest we can get there?
<s> What rehearsal dinner?
<s> But you wanted to fuck me first.
<s> And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
<s> So what's happening with your book?
<s> Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
<s> About a year.
<s> And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.
<s> This one?
<s> No dad!
<s> You don't even know what that word means.
<s> You got two minor league home run records don't you?
<s> Curse and stuff.
<s> I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood?
<s> Yes.
<s> Should we make a run for it out the back?
<s> Got it!
<s> Listen, there's things I can take and a couple things I can't and one of them I can't take, is when my older brother --  -- who is everything I want to be, starts losing faith in things. I saw your eyes last night.  I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay? I'm serious.
<s> It's old Morgan.
<s> What's two?
<s> We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner.
<s> I would say so.
<s> Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn't see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement.  But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar.  I need you to take this seriously, just in case, it is something serious.
<s> Why not?
<s> Yeah.
<s> What do you mean, the horses?
<s> Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
<s> That's why they got you in jail?
<s> Your next water ain't for three days.
<s> Did it seem short to you?
<s> Where were you?
<s> And they were two of them. Look --
<s> I'll be long gone.
<s> Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
<s> I understand.
<s> I'm done talking. Get out.
<s> That ain't right.
<s> This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
<s> Don't press your luck, Carter.
<s> Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
<s> They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
<s> Why would they stop you?
<s> Lucky.
<s> Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
<s> You didn't tell me you owned a saloon.
<s> Well, thanks, but forget it.
<s> Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
<s> Okay -- for you.
<s> Excuse us.
<s> So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
<s> If it's on the page...
<s> What about it?
<s> Even the fall from the plane.
<s> Do what?
<s> No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
<s> Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.
<s> How can you bring that up at a time like this?
<s> That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
<s> Because obviously she existed, right?
<s> He also happens to be the most talented man I've ever known.
<s> Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
<s> Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
<s> Hello, Hal.
<s> You never were together, Hal.
<s> How did the wall get there?
<s> -- Please, get away from me.
<s> You want me to call Security?
<s> I was misquoted.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> I need flesh and --
<s> Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
<s> She's at the premiere of "A Cold Day In Hell".  But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.
<s> I know plenty of boys.
<s> I do.
<s> Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
<s> Night, Lainey.
<s> I noticed.
<s> Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
<s> Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
<s> I could get the death penalty.
<s> What?!
<s> Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
<s> I'm keeping it in trust.
<s> Dark?
<s> My God, you've got one?
<s> I don't understand.
<s> I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
<s> Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
<s> Goodnight, sweetheart.
<s> Okay. Fine. Understood.  I'm off then.
<s> I guess they don't.
<s> Look over there.
<s> He your best buddy?
<s> Something I want?
<s> What?
<s> I forgot myself.
<s> Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
<s> And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?
<s> Don't fail me.
<s> It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
<s> Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy.
<s> Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
<s> No.
<s> Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
<s> What?
<s> I'm ready to communicate with you now.
<s> Yes.
<s> S-ssstop that!
<s> I wish I could be like my momma though. She always knew what was wrong. Knew just what to say.
<s> Superstition.
<s> Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about?
<s> Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
<s> The band.
<s> Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.
<s> Bus broke down.
<s> Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
<s> Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison.
<s> I thought you said two hundred.
<s> Nah. We still got Billy Bob.
<s> ...Guess it was her time to go. You can't argue... when the good Lord calls you home.
<s> Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> I'm not surprised. It's got a body count of zero. And no one goes around in a stupid mask, hacking innocent people to death.
<s> He's right. You were behind.
<s> Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry, wrong answer!
<s> Never.
<s> Like what?
<s> Us? We been... moonlighting.
<s> Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.
<s> Bill, we need to talk!
<s> That's not funny.
<s> I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
<s> No. What…?
<s> I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
<s> Okay.
<s> The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
<s> What do you see? I see a butterfly.
<s> I got to leave my post.
<s> All the rib eyes?
<s> I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
<s> It's just one of my students, Grant.
<s> 'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret.
<s> Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
<s> Last year, this was a new rig.
<s> What do you think?
<s> Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
<s> Eleven.
<s> Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
<s> Enjoy your Kenworth.
<s> Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
<s> I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
<s> You plan on driving trucks all your life?
<s> You take the front, I'll take the back.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Ummm?
<s> Sleep for a week.  Wanna join me?
<s> Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.
<s> That man is your father?!?
<s> Hot Pants, please. I'm gonna be flying by in about five minutes with Smokey on my tail. Can you lock it off behind me?
<s> Running blocker.
<s> Okay, we got a straight shot to T Town, so let her roll.
<s> Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
<s> Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
<s> What's up, Dixie Chicken?
<s> You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> That's the point, Dickey.
<s> Now, you just find him, son.
<s> Chickenshit money.
<s> Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
<s> Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Ww... uh...
<s> And threw us into the lake.
<s> Cinnamon roll? No, good guess though. No, Hugo that looks like jizz...  And I'm no forensic expert mind you, but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelve-thousand dollar calf's skin jacket. The twist? It's My twelve thousand dollar, calf's skin jacket.  So y'got semen, human ejaculate --  -- that's been allowed to soak in for what, six, seven hours now? Work it's way into the fabric-fuck'n fibers -- and while you may never see it in a Tide commercial, I think it still safely qualifies as a "tough, deep down stain."
<s> We have to transport Mr. Israel to Las Vegas, time is of the essence. The gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at Tahoe International. I'm sorry, I'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. Return to Washington. You'll be debriefed in the coming days.
<s> So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
<s> It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
<s> ...So you made another deal?
<s> I don't see it like that at all.
<s> Yeah... Sid?
<s> I'm here.
<s> Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
<s> The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
<s> I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.
<s> No, no, no, y'gotta go in and get him, pull'm out of wherever he at, forget all that other shit, that's just f'flavor. I'm still getting lil' bits'a this-n-that from this cat Padiche, the man contacting me... Right now, what we got --  -- Is a number and a name... Buddy Israel.
<s> You're not Gibarian...
<s> Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
<s> She reappeared exactly as she had before?
<s> Not her.  It.
<s> Shut up.
<s> Rheya.
<s> I wish you'd told me.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Why?
<s> Not necessarily.
<s> Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
<s> But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
<s> That's right.  And we all have to sleep, eventually.
<s> Get out --
<s> She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
<s> Her oxygen would have run out.
<s> Yes.  But not until you mentioned them.  As soon as you said those things, I remembered them.  And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember.  It's like filling up.
<s> I know.  I know.  We don't have to talk about that.
<s> He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
<s> No.  I love you.
<s> How can I tell?  You've seen both of me.  I only know what you're like here.  You're all I know.  There is no "You" from before.
<s> Rheya --
<s> You're lying.  I'm not human.
<s> I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy?
<s> When?
<s> Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here.
<s> Then c'mon.  Follow me.  The art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek.
<s> Can we go then?
<s> He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times.
<s> I came on at 8:00.
<s> How did you know?
<s> I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
<s> Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
<s> Yeah.
<s> I think it's probably still a good idea.
<s> Just putting in an appearance then.
<s> I can still use a gun.
<s> Why?
<s> No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
<s> Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi driver in the Bronx, thirteen months ago.  It's coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law.
<s> It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
<s> D'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
<s> You heard me.
<s> What're you talking about --
<s> What about Tommy?
<s> I'm all right.
<s> Me neither.
<s> It should've been me...
<s> I can't do it, you know that... He's not gonna allow it anyway, Mike.  No way is he gonna let anybody walk out of that house alive, who can finger him.
<s> She's taking singing lessons.
<s> She met some friend of Aunt Millie's who works for a record company.  He thinks she's got a great voice.
<s> I don't think she can sing, either.
<s> Peter Parker, you have no idea what I did this weekend.  Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way.
<s> Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
<s> Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
<s> Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not--
<s> Right.
<s> When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
<s> I know what you mean.  I...
<s> Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
<s> So you've found Thorkel?
<s> It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence, huh?
<s> --but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
<s> Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
<s> No!
<s> Really, Professor, I--
<s> Oh-- I don't know-- thanks, Mr. Reiss, but--
<s> What?
<s> No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
<s> No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.
<s> I'm not so happy myself.
<s> No, no!  Not there!
<s> They may. That's why I would keep my mouth shut.
<s> Is you all little Adolfs?
<s> I don't have to think. We didn't tell anything to anybody. Not a word. Not until we hit this barrack.
<s> Any news on Dunbar?
<s> Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
<s> Roger.
<s> In this barracks?
<s> That's right.
<s> Okay, Security -- what happened?
<s> Easy! Walked right through the gate, past the guard. Like he was some Kraut Field Marshal.
<s> Only he ain't quite finished yet. Blondie -- get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg.
<s> Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
<s> Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
<s> Sefton!
<s> I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
<s> They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
<s> The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.
<s> Simply this. After the hostilities are ended, there will be such a thing as a War Crimes Commission. If this man should be convicted without proper proof, you will be held responsible, Colonel von Scherbach.
<s> Some are not bad at all.
<s> Me? What if she don't want me?
<s> You're teasing me again!
<s> Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
<s> So what? There's other women!
<s> Come on, you little stooge. Hand over them keys.
<s> Hey, here's Esther Williams.
<s> Animal! Got a little something for you!
<s> You want to go?
<s> Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?
<s> We did it.
<s> Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right?
<s> So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
<s> Give this to Joey, will you?
<s> What about the radio?
<s> Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
<s> Six o'clock in Berlin. They were having lunch in Cleveland.  Am I boring you, boys?
<s> Give me the radio.
<s> All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
<s> Ich weiss alles.
<s> Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
<s> Good morning, Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?
<s> No! No!
<s> Talk what? I do not know anything!
<s> Russian women prisoners?
<s> Look at them, Lieutenant. Everybody is a clown! How do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?
<s> Come on, let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?
<s> Okay, Herr Preismaier, let's have the mail box.
<s> Where is he?
<s> Twelve years, sir.
<s> Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
<s> Can you project its course?
<s> Agreed.
<s> You get what?
<s> During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
<s> Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here.
<s> Why would you want to leave?
<s> What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
<s> No.
<s> Too big. How long until the ribbon arrives?
<s> What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene- my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone.
<s> You see the top yardarm, now look to the-
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?
<s> If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's really in for a shock...
<s> Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu.
<s> Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
<s> David!... What went wrong?
<s> We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!
<s> Logic indicates that is the case.
<s> That may be difficult...
<s> I have already made one transmission too many...
<s> I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
<s> And Spock with it. They are joined together.
<s> Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
<s> Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
<s> I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
<s> I'd be grateful, Admiral, if you'd give the word.
<s> Aye, sir!
<s> You would have done the same for me.
<s> She's to be decommissioned.
<s> Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
<s> My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs...
<s> Jim, in your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy... Until the Federation Council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis... Consider it a quarantined planet. And a forbidden subject.
<s> Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
<s> Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!!
<s> Report status!
<s> 
<s> I will speak with you alone, Kirk.
<s> ... Spock...
<s> Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
<s> They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
<s> Our mission is over. I have failed... A human has been bolder and more ruthless than I...  That -- is the real dishonor.
<s> How is that...?
<s> You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.
<s> I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
<s> This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
<s> I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
<s> Ah.
<s> As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.
<s> At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
<s> How can you think of food at a time like this?
<s> We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik.
<s> Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
<s> We have received new orders. Upon our arrival at Regula I, all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at Ceti Alpha VI.
<s> And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
<s> I know, I know...
<s> Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa.
<s> We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
<s> What?
<s> We'll beam aboard and stop it --
<s> Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
<s> But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
<s> The Admiral's son.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Warp drive still inoperative. All other systems should be restored shortly.
<s> Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
<s> My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
<s> Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?
<s> Uhura, patch me in --
<s> He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
<s> I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
<s> You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
<s> Who?
<s> We're finding it.  Please, <u>please</u> -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative...
<s> Phasers on stun. Move out.
<s> On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know.
<s> Power levels quite low, sir.
<s> Two minutes, ten seconds.
<s> Aye, sir --
<s> Scotty!
<s> Phasers locked...
<s> Honors -- hup!
<s> Thank you, Mr. Saavik.
<s> By the book...
<s> ... They do, indeed.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence.  I mean whales may not have painted the Mona Lisa or invented the dirt bike but they didn't ravish the land either.
<s> A moment alone, please.
<s> It'll come back to him.
<s> If you have a better idea - now's the time.
<s> Tearing of the middle meningeal artery...
<s> Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
<s> Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
<s> It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
<s> It is.
<s> Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
<s> My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!
<s> Negative. It's impacting on all our systems!
<s> It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.
<s> I'm wery sorry, but --
<s> We are launching everything we have.
<s> To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.
<s> How soon?
<s> I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
<s> I buy that. What about him?
<s> You've already been that. C'mon.
<s> What does that mean, exactly? Take their chances.
<s> ... You're very perceptive.
<s> See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
<s> Hm?
<s> Right.
<s> Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
<s> A spaceship with a missing man.
<s> Why does it have to be goodbye?
<s> Don't worry. I'll find <u>you</u>.  See you around the galaxy...
<s> A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans
<s> To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
<s> As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
<s> Exaggerate.
<s> I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
<s> Is that the logical thing to do, Spock...?
<s> Weapons systems?
<s> Steady!!...  Now, Mr. Sulu!
<s> Picture, Uhura!
<s> Aye, sir!
<s> Nothing... I should never have left him...
<s> Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
<s> On screen.
<s> About 60 feet, Admiral.
<s> Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
<s> On my way...!
<s> Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.
<s> Oh, here and there.  I flew something similar in my Academy days.
<s> I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.
<s> To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in your village... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.
<s> I've been shot at... thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship that's come to abduct us all... what's there to panic about?
<s> But not you.
<s> More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
<s> The "mighty" Federation could learn a few things from this village...
<s> Perhaps, that is true.
<s> I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
<s> For what purpose?
<s> It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
<s> Your Captain used to cut quite a rug...
<s> From the mission...
<s> Another time.
<s> We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed.  Dougherty out.
<s> I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.
<s> Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out.
<s> A planet in Federation space...
<s> There's nothing further to be gained from this...
<s> The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
<s> And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba'ku we were a threat...
<s> Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
<s> On screen.
<s> How long 'til they reach us?
<s> Commander Riker...
<s> You Klingons never do anything small, do you...
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> Fat chance. I'll post it on every monitor on the ship...
<s> No, we're here to... rescue them.
<s> Worf, what the hell are you doing here?
<s> Sir?
<s> Make it so.
<s> Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...
<s> Is there any other way to disable the injector?
<s> You have two days to become experts... Mister Worf, your job and mine will be to find a plan to safely capture Data.
<s> They have an incredible clarity of perception, Captain. I've never encountered a species with such mental discipline...
<s> ... I believe you...
<s> Absolutely.
<s> Yes...
<s> It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
<s> Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
<s> If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
<s> Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
<s> I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage.
<s> A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
<s> The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
<s> Contact Starfleet Command.
<s> According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
<s> I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
<s> Not very well. We met shortly after the Enterprise-E was commissioned. I found her to be a most... promising officer.
<s> I will admit... there are times when I wish I had an emotion chip I could turn on and off.
<s> It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface.
<s> Altitude fifty kilometers...
<s> There's a red light on the second intake valve.
<s> Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.
<s> Great name. French?
<s> And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
<s> Too bad.  Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.
<s> We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
<s> Some.
<s> No. It's a lot further than that.
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
<s> Right.
<s> There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
<s> At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
<s> Vulcans sleep lying down...
<s> You heard the order, Lieutenant.
<s> We're not finished.
<s> Bones, are you afraid of the future?
<s> Don't remind me.
<s> She didn't need our help getting anywhere... where did she get these convenient clothes? And don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue...
<s> And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
<s> Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of "exploration"...
<s> Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
<s> We were until your torpedoes!
<s> Stand...?
<s> The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
<s> That isn't true...!
<s> Yes.
<s> I have on occasion disobeyed orders.
<s> I know what you mean...
<s> What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
<s> She programmed the torpedo hits?
<s> He's got it.
<s> Possibly.
<s> Candidate for what?
<s> Captain, if --
<s> WHO ELSE...?
<s> Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
<s> Sir?
<s> You hear that?
<s> Sulu!
<s> Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
<s> Thank you, Captain Sulu.
<s> I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
<s> This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James Kirk commanding.
<s> An error.
<s> We are experiencing a technical malfunction. All backup systems inoperative.
<s> I do not think so. Enterprise has disobeyed orders and harbors two escaped convicts. Admiral Donald will make certain all your ship-to- shore transmissions are jammed.
<s> Mr. Scott, you forget yourself. Please accompany me.
<s> That's hardly conclusive, Mr. Scott, as Klingons have no tear ducts.
<s> I know precisely where he'll be.
<s> There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
<s> Aye, aye, sir.
<s> Maybe we should write them a letter?
<s> Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
<s> No.
<s> No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
<s> You're working late.
<s> I wish I could believe that, Doctor.
<s> I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.
<s> Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
<s> Yes. And, frankly, I envy them as well. They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them. New worlds to conquer...
<s> You never know what's over the horizon, Data. Before too long you'll be offered a command of your own.
<s> New worlds. Yes Data, brave new worlds...
<s> Thank you, Data.  Let's see what she can do.
<s> I can see that.
<s> Sorry, sir.
<s> Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed.
<s> Fire!
<s> Of you?
<s> Why is it moving?
<s> As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
<s> This isn't about me anymore.
<s> I can feel your desire, Deanna.
<s> When this is over, I owe you a drink.
<s> Do you have life support?
<s> And that's exactly what he's going to do.
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> I'll take care of it, sir.
<s> Understood.
<s> Not with the Romulans.
<s> Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of?
<s> What sort of signature?
<s> If you don't mind.
<s> Your new chair, sir.
<s> Acknowledged ...  ...I'll talk to Data.
<s> Patience. Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation. We can wait.
<s> Can anything be done for him?
<s> She's the most beautiful ship I’ve ever seen.
<s> I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
<s> When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
<s> I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
<s> Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
<s> You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
<s> I know.
<s> I won't defend my life to you.
<s> Let's go.
<s> Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'
<s> Seven minutes.
<s> None.
<s> The Scimitar will serve my needs.
<s> I came this far alone ...
<s> Silence, Romulan!
<s> Probably kids.
<s> I don't think so... 
<s> Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
<s> Shermin...
<s> Washington thinks it's too late for that.
<s> You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.
<s> Okay...
<s> I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
<s> Marc Shermin.
<s> Steering wheel.
<s> Smile.
<s> You're full of tricks, aren't you?
<s> It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
<s> You'll see.
<s> I am...
<s> Space?
<s> Horses.
<s> I do not understand.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> A baby is a new person?
<s> Do you have a baby?
<s> I do not speak English.
<s> You keep this. Now this is hitch- hike...  You stand on the side of the road, the highway... you understand? And you face the cars going in the direction you want to go. When you see a car or a truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this...
<s> What?
<s> It was a mistake.
<s> No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...
<s> The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
<s> He will.
<s> The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
<s> I understand.
<s> This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
<s> You want the baby to laugh at me.
<s> He doesn't understand... just walk away...
<s> What? No, of course not.
<s> Sure.
<s> Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and say...
<s> You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. You know what's gonna come out of this... The end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. We could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. Don't you see that? Are you too stupid to see that?
<s> It could have been anything.
<s> People have made mistakes in these situations before.
<s> We better get it into the box. Come on...
<s> It was a man though... right?
<s> No.
<s> I saw you play, man.  You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying.  So what happened, injuries or what?
<s> Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
<s> Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.
<s> Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
<s> Hey, he was going to kill you.  And this ratfuck paid to have Iris killed, to save his own sorry ass.
<s> My God.
<s> I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
<s> 'We might as well make the best of it.'
<s> Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
<s> I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
<s> Tonight.
<s> Damn right.
<s> Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
<s> The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
<s> I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
<s> That's right.  Clips.  Look, I want you to know what we're talking about here.  This isn't like TV only better.  This is life.  It's a piece of somebody's life.  Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex.  You're there. You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it.
<s> I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.
<s> Okay... what about Strickland?
<s> Where's Faith?
<s> I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?
<s> Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I got to get this rig fixed.  Look at it...
<s> What?
<s> Faith, can I talk to you a second?
<s> I was invited here by a close friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right over there.
<s> I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
<s> I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
<s> Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
<s> She's my destiny.
<s> I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
<s> Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
<s> You sure?
<s> Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important.
<s> Well, look at the plus side.
<s> Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
<s> I'm not going.
<s> Then we'll be right where we are now.
<s> Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
<s> Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
<s> I'm sorry. This won't take long.
<s> We need to run this through VICAP, search for similar burns.
<s> Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
<s> Whole country or just hereabouts?
<s> Fucking. I'm talking about fucking, Harold. You ever think of fucking other women?
<s> What do you want from me?
<s> He had an orange hat on.
<s> What about his killer?
<s> What's with the eyelids?
<s> Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
<s> Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
<s> They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
<s> Not especially.
<s> That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how.
<s> My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.
<s> He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
<s> Because you asked him to, stupid.
<s> "Intra-Agency fraternizing."
<s> Does Koessler ask about me?
<s> Sue Ann Hanson.
<s> You found the body. She was one of Harold Speck's victims. In El Paso.  They're not just talking to each other, Mack, they're trading souvenirs.
<s> Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
<s> Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies, voyeurism, mutilation, teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman.
<s> That's true.
<s> Slow down a second, you met with Low --
<s> Koessler doesn't know any of this?
<s> It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us.
<s> But it was your idea: "use Zero," you said, use Zero to get Low.
<s> How are we going to find him?
<s> Of course he does. Now get the key, get these things off me.  Unhook me.
<s> The little piggie speaks.
<s> Yes.
<s> He's moved on to TV.
<s> Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
<s> Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not likely. I told you, I'd gotten a bit obsessive. It was an opportunity to back off, think things through.  Where's the file?
<s> Lead the way, Murman.
<s> [Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight, exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]
<s> [Not the heart, the watch.]
<s> Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
<s> Four hundred and sixty, sir.
<s> I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
<s> The same.
<s> 350 miles.
<s> You're right. I know.
<s> What do you drive?
<s> What kind of car do you drive?
<s> Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
<s> What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
<s> No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
<s> Oh. You know.
<s> ...and even then...
<s> No.
<s> Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
<s> They were auditioning for the same role as you?
<s> Don't worry. He's in good hands.
<s> You want this in black chips.
<s> Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables.
<s> No...
<s> Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet...
<s> I understand.
<s> Well... You can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you.
<s> ...Nah. I'm right across the street...
<s> I can call back...
<s> ...the Michelin commercial...
<s> You don't call.
<s> Right.
<s> It's a gig.
<s> What do you want? You're tall.
<s> I didn't want to say anything.
<s> Kinda.
<s> I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
<s> Well, that's dumb.
<s> ...People get carjacked...
<s> ...Whatever. You're like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it up...
<s> Hi, Nikki. This is Mike. I met you tonight at the Dresden. I, uh, just called to say I, uh, I'm really glad we met and you should give me a call. So call me tomorrow, or, like, in two days, whatever. My number is 213- 555-4679... 
<s> Wow, I guess you were home... 
<s> I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment".
<s> I don't know...
<s> We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
<s> I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
<s> Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
<s> Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
<s> Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
<s> Let's go.
<s> She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
<s> ...gotta...
<s> Oh fuck that. You don't have to try and impress anyone. You think I give a shit? You think I sweat that skanky whore waitress...
<s> "Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
<s> ...It's just, I thought "Renaissance" was too Excaliber, it's the wrong casino. She would've gotten it, though...
<s> No! Not the camera guy!
<s> How?
<s> Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off.
<s> ...through the kitchen...
<s> What?
<s> She didn't notice.
<s> What a surprise.
<s> ...Is he brown?
<s> No.
<s> Damn. Now I gotta go in early.
<s> ...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"...
<s> Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like.
<s> Yes. 
<s> Then make them suffer as she suffers.  How much shall I pay you.
<s> I want you to use all your powers, all your skill, as you love me.  I do not want his mother to see him as he is.
<s> I'm not hungry yet.
<s> Ba Fa Goulle.
<s> How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
<s> The gun will be there.
<s> He owns the studio.  Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller.  And the main character is a guy just like me.  I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself.
<s> You understand him better than anyone.
<s> And with prison record.
<s> On a day like this.  Consiglero, do you also have in your notes the the Turk made his living from Prostitution before the war, like the Tattaglias do now.  Write that down before you forget it.  The Turk will wait.
<s> Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could never have outfought Santino.  But I wasn't sure until this day.  No, it was Barzini all along.
<s> Maybe I can help.
<s> I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
<s> Tom, what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a citizen.
<s> You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
<s> Bad news from America.  Your brother, Santino.  He has been killed.
<s> Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
<s> Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
<s> This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
<s> And hair.  Black and curly, like a doll.  And such a mouth.
<s> Come here a minute, Fredo.
<s> The Don has semi-retired.  I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me.
<s> The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list.
<s> No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.
<s> Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength.  Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war.  The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny.
<s> No.  Our informer in McCluskey's precinct.  Tonight at 8:00 he signed out for Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx.  Anyone know it.
<s> They're waiting to see my father.
<s> They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
<s> Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
<s> I told you you wouldn't like him.
<s> Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night.
<s> Can I go to the hospital with you?
<s> When will I see you again?
<s> Oh Michael.
<s> Don't you want dinner first?
<s> Wake me up when you come to bed?
<s> Don't ask me.
<s> Oh your father just had too many visitors.  It interfered with the hospital service.  The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago.  But don't worry.  I look in on him.
<s> You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
<s> Until the old man tells me different.
<s> To the city.
<s> The kid's right.
<s> Just be patient.
<s> Be patient.
<s> Thanks.
<s> The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone family wants to buy you out.
<s> You just woke up!
<s> Did you speak to my father?
<s> Okay, darling.
<s> Okay.
<s> It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys.
<s> What?
<s> See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
<s> No, no brothers, no sisters.
<s> Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
<s> I did. And then maybe get the jacket and what have you...
<s> I was just fooling around. Don't say anything. Sorry.
<s> I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on here without money. It's time we all moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great, though, if you came with me. Our last trip before you leave. There's a jazz festival -- we could say goodbye in style. What do you think? A last trip?
<s> Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
<s> I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
<s> Oh God, I don't think so.
<s> Hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying!
<s> I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club. Have some drinks, lotta ladies...
<s> The landlady -- as far as I could tell, the landlady said he was here right now.
<s> I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but...
<s> Tom. How are you? You look well.
<s> Where's Mr MacCarron?
<s> I'm fine.
<s> Sure.
<s> Tom, you startled me! You're back.
<s> What does that mean?
<s> Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
<s> I think you're right.
<s> Get on. I'll take you to him.
<s> Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
<s> Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
<s> Shut up! Shut up!
<s> I don't believe a single word you've said.
<s> You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
<s> I think we sort of found each other.
<s> Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
<s> My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
<s> You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
<s> You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
<s> And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.
<s> Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him in months. No, I'm alone. 
<s> But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
<s> A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.
<s> Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha molte fidanzate.
<s> He says so many fiancées.
<s> No key, huh?
<s> You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
<s> Yes?
<s> I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him?
<s> Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
<s> Of course. What happened to your face?
<s> Does he stay with you here?
<s> I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  Tomorrow then?
<s> Who mam?
<s> Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that's a lonely girl. She needs a friend. And I'm gonna be her friend. 
<s> He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.
<s> Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
<s> South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
<s> I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
<s> Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
<s> What?
<s> Oh. Who was that again?
<s> Just didn't get around to it, huh?
<s> More people watch it.
<s> That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
<s> That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
<s> Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
<s> You sure he's not Italian?
<s> I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
<s> I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
<s> What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
<s> In the jungle. 122nd.
<s> Pittsburgh.
<s> He shoots dope too.
<s> He's worse than an animal. Jail's too good for scum like that.
<s> Me? I could never go to a place like that.
<s> I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
<s> You just gonna leave 'em?
<s> Cops don't do nothin.
<s> I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
<s> I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
<s> Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
<s> Yes.
<s> I can't sleep nights.
<s> I know. I tried that.
<s> You want to work uptown nights?
<s> Military record?
<s> Well then check back tomorrow.
<s> Oh, lots. I don't know where they all are now. There used to be one standing over there. 
<s> You would, huh?
<s> Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
<s> Slow.
<s> Neither do I, I guess.
<s> Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed?  Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years.
<s> Archbishop of Canterbury.  Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...
<s> Partners.
<s> I'm not a fool, Billy.
<s> What's that?  Mason?
<s> You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
<s> Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
<s> Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.
<s> You mean,  me?
<s> No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
<s> Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
<s> No, it's okay.  See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?
<s> Eventually.  We were going to be  engaged... when you came back from  overseas...
<s> Start with what you knew then.
<s> A statement?
<s> Mr. Appleton, you will...
<s> Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
<s> By all means.
<s> Ah.
<s> Mother.  She's beautiful.
<s> You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has.
<s> "one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"
<s> Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did.  You've got to remember that.  You've got to.
<s> You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
<s> Yes.
<s> What.
<s> Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
<s> I don't remember.  I guess so. Smells like it.  Tastes like it.
<s> Thanks.
<s> I... no, I... I just can't...
<s> Don't smell nothin'.  He must not be dead in here.
<s> I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
<s> I was decorated.
<s> Well, that's a relief.  I understand they usually don't let that stop them.
<s> That's not the country Luke fought for.
<s> When was that?
<s> Oh dear, yes.  You were an excellent student, before all that clarinet nonsense.  You loved Chopin.  You used to call it "heaven music."  "Teach me some heaven music," you used to say.
<s> I thought you...
<s> Yes.
<s> Different?
<s> When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
<s> No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
<s> Just listen to them!
<s> Yes?
<s> Well, I suppose...
<s> I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.
<s> I don't know, honey.
<s> I wish I could say. But if I could answer that, I could also tell you why people are trying to kill people.
<s> The little Brenner girl?
<s> Alice, I think.  Harry, what's the little Brenner girl's name?
<s> Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
<s> I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet...
<s> Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
<s> Yes.
<s> Mother, where did you go to law school?
<s> I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
<s> Shhh. Shhh.
<s> Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, isn't it, Mitch?
<s> I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
<s> Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
<s> I don't mind, really.
<s> Did you close the door?
<s> Not by the thousands.
<s> Eleven. In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...
<s> No, you got quite a mess here, I'll admit that.  Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney  Seems a little pointless, though. Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years.  You want some help cleaning up?
<s> Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.
<s> The sign says strawberry finches.
<s> No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
<s> Just some peroxide. I want to clean out the cut.
<s> Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
<s> Yes?
<s> I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
<s> You are, aren't you?
<s> How does Mother know what I like to do?
<s> No.
<s> What do you want ?
<s> What do you do?
<s> A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
<s> Certainly, of birds.
<s> Hear!
<s> Take wing!
<s> Mmm?
<s> With my little sparrow leading team.
<s> It may not be last week again for a long long time.
<s> Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
<s> Inland.
<s> Almost two a.m.
<s> How about you?
<s> I... I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right.
<s> I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. 
<s> Well, all right, but...
<s> How soon?
<s> To...  To kill them.
<s> It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
<s> How?
<s> Can we go on living here otherwise?
<s> Not if they're starting a war.
<s> Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
<s> Probably herring gulls. They arrive in November, you know, and don't migrate North again until March or...
<s> Of course.
<s> Ask this one favor --
<s> Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
<s> But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.
<s> I heard my parents speak of it in Thrums. It was a famous case.
<s> Excuse me.
<s> From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
<s> I remember her.
<s> You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
<s> Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
<s> This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.
<s> I am sure.  I mean to report it. It's like Burke and Hare all over again.
<s> I can't believe that.
<s> That's the way of it, Fettes.  You bring the lassie to me.
<s> No.
<s> He was a nice horse.
<s> Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
<s> I've had some experience.
<s> Get out of here!
<s> It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
<s> Yes.
<s> No, Joseph. I'm not angry -- here -- another glass of brandy --I'll wager it's better than the doctor's.
<s> I come from Lisbon.
<s> A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
<s> But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
<s> No great lady will ever take my place?
<s> I'll get him.
<s> He must leave me alone.
<s> You're wrong.
<s> I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
<s> You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
<s> Nobody.
<s> Someone else did it.
<s> I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
<s> My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
<s> I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
<s> It's not. I can't take it.
<s> Good for you. You do know something.
<s> Let's hope not. License and registration please.
<s> Just hold on to me.
<s> Honey. I just can't.
<s> Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
<s> What's that supposed to mean? He was right here. He was!
<s> Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
<s> About you.
<s> I'm never going back in that house again. Get away.
<s> What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.
<s> I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
<s> I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.  I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.
<s> My name is Klaatu.  I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White -- and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who's getting married next Wednesday.  If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time.
<s> It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
<s> If you mean that you are afraid of us--
<s> I leave that in your hands.
<s> I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.
<s> Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
<s> Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
<s> Boy, we had a swell time. Didn't we, Mr. Carpenter?
<s> What do you mean, dear?
<s> I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
<s> I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
<s> Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
<s> No -- I want to take you to the movies.  Do you think they'd accept these?
<s> Why not, Bobby?
<s> Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
<s> Why -- the light in my room went out.  Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.
<s> This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
<s> I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
<s> I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
<s> I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it.
<s> What about him?
<s> But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
<s> I enjoyed every minute of it.
<s> Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon, but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.
<s> Goodnight, my dear.
<s> May I see you for a minute?
<s> There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth.  If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." Please repeat that.
<s> Remember those words.
<s> This technique, in certain cases, can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people.
<s> You might keep this.  I think the professor will want to get in touch with me.
<s> I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
<s> No -- I'm afraid not.
<s> They would have killed this man?
<s> Get going, will you, Brady -- before I get mad!
<s> This one could save your life.
<s> Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
<s> Zero.
<s> I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer.  Have you taken any human victims yet?
<s> The meanest!
<s> Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult.
<s> How do you know they're not?
<s> Hit the lights again.
<s> That's exactly what this place is. One great big coffin.  Let's stake 'em.
<s> If you're telling the truth, it means we can save you.
<s> Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
<s> Did we have a date tonight?
<s> Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.
<s> No.  Just you.
<s> I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.
<s> Smells like something died.
<s> You've heard this story before?
<s> He's already gone to bed.
<s> Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.
<s> Lucy.
<s> Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
<s> I don't want to fight with you, Lucy.  Come on.  Let's give it one more try.  Dinner at my house, tomorrow night.  I'm cooking.
<s> It was all going to be so perfect, Lucy.  One big happy family.  My boys... and <u>yours</u>.
<s> Okay, Sam.  Thanks.
<s> No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
<s> It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
<s> I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.
<s> That's okay, Mom.  I can see it later.  I'll help you unload.
<s> Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?
<s> You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
<s> Wanna go to the comic book store?
<s> Piss off.
<s> I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
<s> Let's load 'em.
<s> Have you come across Fuchs?
<s> Now who'd go and do...
<s> Let go of me...
<s> What's it going to do, being a plant?
<s> But...
<s> What?
<s> What clothes?
<s> We ain't buying that.
<s> Damn you, MacReady!
<s> Thank you.
<s> A couple of hours.
<s> A serum test possibly.
<s> After all this mess.
<s> One thousand volts.  Should be enough.
<s> Bullshit!  He's got to know damn well I cut it!
<s> What?!
<s> I'm so sorry, Kalen.
<s> No...
<s> But you're only a mud carrier.
<s> This is it?
<s> Yes.
<s> Last night.
<s> Yes.
<s> The Morlocks didn't build this.
<s> End...?
<s> Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
<s> Vox...
<s> I'll never forget this.
<s> Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
<s> We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
<s> Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
<s> I -- what are you?!
<s> You know I can't.
<s> Alex, it's just the zoo.
<s> Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
<s> Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
<s> Oh?
<s> Why don't you come to our house instead?
<s> When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
<s> Yes...
<s> Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really.  It's rather hard to explain.
<s> Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
<s> You're not from beyond the valley.
<s> I will...
<s> Then you came to a desert and mountains...
<s> We share everything.
<s> Yes.
<s> What's it all for?
<s> You liked it there.
<s> Did you have fires at night?
<s> Someone you loved very much.
<s> I know what it is to lose someone. When my husband was taken from us... I thought the pain would never end.
<s> My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.
<s> I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
<s> Very good.  Now if you will excuse us for a moment.
<s> New Yorkers.
<s> Alexander, I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.
<s> They've gone to a better place.
<s> That wasn't a fucking restraint.
<s> Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!
<s> They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
<s> Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
<s> You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
<s> I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
<s> I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
<s> Oh yeah, what'd he say?
<s> I never touched your father! I swear!
<s> Sure.
<s> Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something. [Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.
<s> [Beat] What?
<s> I know.
<s> They're not.
<s> Ok.
<s> I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.
<s> I could try to...make it stop.
<s> Why?
<s> Come on. Tell me what you do know.
<s> It doesn't look all that different.
<s> Because I don't have time.
<s> I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
<s> I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
<s> What for?
<s> Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
<s> Don't you go to jail for that?
<s> [Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.
<s> Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
<s> Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
<s> I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late.
<s> What.
<s> No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner.  I may not even make it home for dinner.  You know how Fridays are.
<s> See ya.
<s> No you won't.  You'll be back today. Now!  You get your ass back here, Thelma, now, Goddamnit.  Thelma, do you understand me?
<s> What?
<s> Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
<s> That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
<s> Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
<s> Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que.
<s> A .38.
<s> The important thing is not to let on that you know anything.  We want to try and find out where they are. Now I don't want to get too personal, but do you have a good relationship with your wife?  Are you close with her?
<s> Oh, definitely.
<s> Human nature.  I'm majoring in behavioral science.
<s> Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all take care.
<s> J.D.!  Just tell me.  I know you're not some schoolboy.  Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.
<s> Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never got arrested for burglary. Burglary's for chicken shits.  If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  Just take the money.  That's robbery.  That's a whole 'nother deal.
<s> Well, first you pick your place, see, then I'd just sit back and watch it for awhile.  Ya gotta wait for just the right moment, which is something you know instinctively, that can't be taught.  Then I'd waltz on in...
<s> You're a little angle, you are.
<s> Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished.
<s> In the back?
<s> It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
<s> How come he let you go?
<s> Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
<s> Isn't this fun?
<s> Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma!  Who's gonna believe that?!  We just don't live in that kind of world.  Pull over!
<s> Just what is that supposed to mean?
<s> What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me look.
<s> I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
<s> I don't know.  I won't be.
<s> Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit! Shit!
<s> They think we like it.  Maybe they think it turns us on.
<s> Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
<s> You mean now or before?
<s> Well, now, maybe you won't have to.
<s> Nothing.  It's not funny.
<s> Harlan.
<s> Okay, Louise... It's okay.
<s> I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
<s> About how fast was I going?
<s> Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
<s> Yeah, you want it?
<s> No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.
<s> Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
<s> Well, let me know when you figure it out.
<s> Good.
<s> Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.
<s> It's grand!
<s> Yeah.  I been seein' you, too.
<s> You got that right.
<s> I guess.
<s> Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
<s> Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
<s> Hey, look on the bright side --
<s> What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
<s> Huh? But why did Healy?
<s> Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.  She's even more beautiful than I remember.
<s> Mints?
<s> Jesus Christ you're right.
<s> Big time.
<s> What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
<s> Who the fuck is it to you?
<s> Yep.
<s> A girl after your own heart, Ted.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Same here again.
<s> Pat Healy.
<s> Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...
<s> A fucking moron.
<s> Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
<s> We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that reminds me, I've got to call what's- his-face and cancel.
<s> Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Well, I know you're busy...
<s> I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
<s> I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
<s> Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
<s> Oh, uh, I resigned.
<s> Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
<s> Did you study under Kim Greene?
<s> Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?!
<s> You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her.
<s> Bullshit!
<s> And you met Mary how?
<s> Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
<s> I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
<s> I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
<s> Fuck kindred spirits. My little Puffy here's gonna tell you all you need to know about this guy in about two seconds flat. If he starts yapping, he's a loser; if Puffy's relaxed... well, you got yourself a keeper.
<s> Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I will.
<s> Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
<s> Where would I have seen your work?
<s> Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.
<s> I've got a friend in the Boston police department. He faxed me this this morning. I'll just give you the highlights.  After a short stint as a petty thief, Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he committed his first murder -- a pretty teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when, despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him. In his mid- twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of Utah and Washington. Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn't enough evidence to hold him, and on and on and so forth and so on.
<s> Oh Jesus...
<s> Huh?
<s> Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.
<s> Oh yeah.
<s> You betcha!
<s> No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick.
<s> Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
<s> Yeah, sure.
<s> Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
<s> You forgot your keys!
<s> It?  Oh it. All right, these things happen, let me have a look. It's not the end of the world.
<s> Great. Great.  So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know, with me.
<s> Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
<s> Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
<s> We've got bigger problems right now.
<s> That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?
<s> -- I'm just trying to make a point. This idea is that fucking bad.
<s> No, Ken. I need to see him now...
<s> I think it's a bad idea.
<s> This is from the Highest Authority?
<s> McCone's been notified and is coming back from the West coast. Carter's here, though.
<s> The Soviets are in control of the SAMs. It's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch.
<s> Tell you what. We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff. I'll get you up front with him during the flight.
<s> In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things there.
<s> Maybe it's harder for them to say it than they let on. At the very least, they believe it's in our best interest. And at the end of the day, they may end up being right.
<s> Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.
<s> Hey. Nice tie.
<s> Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones.
<s> Rug samples.
<s> -- did you understand me when I said that --
<s> Jesus...
<s> Airborne. That's where they used to get us agents from. Now we get 'em from Carnegie-Melon, Ivy League. Accountants and computer whiz-kids. Yuppies with guns.  That's scary shit.
<s> You crashed my file?
<s> Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
<s> What is it? It's genocide, that's what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for the people here. Uranium, Cooch.
<s> Let the press through.
<s> His spiritual mother...
<s> Is that right? What are the trees saying today?
<s> Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.
<s> Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.
<s> Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when.
<s> Well, it was just a dream, I --
<s> What do you mean?
<s> What the hell do you want me to do?!
<s> Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.
<s> I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead.
<s> Bullshit, let's get outta here,
<s> Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
<s> Move it, Magdelana.
<s> NO.  My father never told anybody he had Indian blood. But he still used a few Indian words around the house. He called me Washee. Said it meant... good boy.
<s> Go ahead, Ray.
<s> Leo Fast Elk... is alive.
<s> How the hell do you know?
<s> Miles. Three other suits. That's all I know 'em as -- suits. Were you there?
<s> No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.
<s> Two miles.
<s> No.
<s> Evan... or Maverick.
<s> You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.
<s> Are you really that brave?
<s> Why?
<s> Why, what's gonna happen?
<s> I don't think so, but if that's what you want...
<s> Hardly ever.
<s> I like to play "reality".
<s> How does it go?
<s> That's three.
<s> Who's gonna win?
<s> Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
<s> F-14's sir.
<s> No sir! But you have to be ready.
<s> Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
<s> You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
<s> No! Now we're inverted!
<s> NO. NO GOOD.
<s> BREAKING LEFT!
<s> Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We did it...Damn! We sure did it!
<s> But I have to!
<s> MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.
<s> Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
<s> Like what?
<s> No shit. The Iceman....
<s> Right.
<s> Was.
<s> Skipper, you can't do this!
<s> The girl with the purple fingernails?
<s> FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.
<s> NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
<s> LOOK OUT!
<s> Just below ten thousand.
<s> Didn't everybody?
<s> How's it goin', Coog?
<s> Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
<s> All right.
<s> You think I should quit?!
<s> Why not?
<s> Take me to the hotel.
<s> Not true, he's one of my best friends...He's got a big house and a Mercedes.  And you like Melina, right?  Well, you'll get to fuck her every night.--That's right.  She's gonna be Hauser's babe.
<s> I am Quaid.
<s> I know that.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!
<s> I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there.
<s> Nice to meet you.
<s> Don't you keep up with the news?  We're doing alien artifacts now.
<s> Eight years.
<s> This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
<s> Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
<s> That's right.
<s> This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down.
<s> We don't have much choice then, do we?
<s> Well don't.
<s> A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized.
<s> You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
<s> Up to the right.
<s> What is it?
<s> I've got him.  The guy in the turban.
<s> Come on!
<s> What the hell is this?
<s> Drive!  DRIVE!!
<s> Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
<s> Nobody.
<s> Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
<s> All right, forget about it.
<s> You.  You're the same.  No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you.  Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.  I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an "Ego Trip".
<s> You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.
<s> What's he talking about?
<s> I love you.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
<s> The one in the mine!
<s> Of course not.  If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.
<s> We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars.  You asked me to find you if you disappeared.  So here I am, good-bye.
<s> Ready as we'll ever be.
<s> I think I scared it!
<s> Right.  We're gonna run.  Get ready.
<s> Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
<s> Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum...
<s> Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.
<s> Has a lot of rain.
<s> Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
<s> Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
<s> Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here?
<s> Me, too.
<s> Chuck him out the door!  Like a little hors d'oeuvre.
<s> Just about too damn long.  Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
<s> Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
<s> Sell the movie rights.  We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
<s> No ties.
<s> God, what a stink!
<s> Could be.
<s> Yeah, geography.
<s> Around here?  Why would they?
<s> Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
<s> And one good guy.
<s> Absolutely not. No more than seven percent.
<s> The testimony will remain in the record. Do you wish to cross-examine?
<s> Let's snuff this lowlife!
<s> Not necessarily...
<s> I can see the hammer still, it was cocked...
<s> We had a description of the suspect.
<s> Your Honor, the witness' response was non-responsive... I ask you to strike it from the record...!
<s> Chinatown street gang.
<s> Eddie... I don't know about this...
<s> Saving it for the Sunday Times.
<s> -- You found his mugshot?
<s> I didn't ask for a closing argument.
<s> I feel much better now.
<s> 1530 Rivington Street.
<s> ...What do you mean?
<s> Christ... Shu is innocent.
<s> Everyone else was wrong and the one fucking lunatic was right!
<s> Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
<s> I was never politically correct enough for Comrade Dowd.
<s> I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.
<s> That's right.
<s> Maybe... because someone's afraid.
<s> About Chinatown. What went down.
<s> You tell me, man.
<s> It's okay, Eddie.
<s> When I joined up I took an oath of secrecy. I told you what you needed to know.
<s> This and that.
<s> That's right.
<s> You know you're very tense, Mr. Reynard. Y'oughta take a week off, fly the wife and kids to Oahu.
<s> Argumentative.
<s> Badgering.
<s> I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
<s> -- Every word.
<s> I would tend to plead the Fifth.
<s> Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
<s> Soldado.
<s> Albert.
<s> It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
<s> Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
<s> I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.
<s> I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
<s> An old woman and her grandson.
<s> Was there an argument?
<s> Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
<s> ALBERT, WHY TYLENOL?
<s> And neither will I.
<s> Stanley, I heard all about it.
<s> No, sir, we did not.
<s> Any friends?
<s> Say no more.
<s> I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
<s> What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
<s> He talks loud. And he loves his code.
<s> That's what I heard.
<s> Cole said she was 17.
<s> In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
<s> Faulty wiring.
<s> You didn't do your homework?
<s> Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
<s> I don't know what to do.
<s> Well, why not?
<s> Okay, I suppose I should go home.
<s> Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
<s> No, you're the muffin.
<s> You mean Fred and Ginger?
<s> Gotta go, Donna. I'll call you tomorrow.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Not you, Donna, not you.
<s> No.
<s> WE got it back, that's all.
<s> Cause I like it.
<s> Fill 'er up.
<s> Brother, I hear you talkin'.
<s> What does Bob say?
<s> What? She asked about my father?
<s> Hiking?
<s> What were you doing in my room?
<s> Mom... what are you wearing?
<s> Sure you do, it's good for you.
<s> Stay away from me.
<s> Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands.
<s> If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the "Meals on Wheels".
<s> Nothing.
<s> As far as we know, nothing.
<s> The man's an ambulance chaser...
<s> Well, of course, it's always dangerous...
<s> Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
<s> Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> Huh!
<s> I'll rule on that presently.  Proceed.
<s> Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
<s> I was her doctor.
<s> Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
<s> She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
<s> Yes.
<s> ...that's all right.
<s> Hold on a second.
<s> From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
<s> ...I made a reservation at...
<s> ...What difference would...
<s> In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
<s> No. No. Thank you. You go home.
<s> Well...
<s> Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
<s> Why is that?
<s> Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I...
<s> I. Yes. It is.
<s> Why?
<s> I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
<s> Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill?
<s> Hi. How are you doing?
<s> Mrs...
<s> That's a wonderful profession. My daughter-in-law's a nurse. What did you do, stop?
<s> My client can't walk, your Honor.
<s> You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
<s> That happens.
<s> No, no, you listen to me. All I wanted in this case is an even shake. You rushed me into court in five days... my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn. I'm going up there and I'm going to try it. Let the Jury decide. They told me Sweeney he's a hard- ass, he's a defendant's judge. I don't care. I said, the hell with it. The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
<s> And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who you were. You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you are.
<s> Overruled...
<s> My ex-husband was a lawyer.
<s> Yes. It was, actually.
<s> Laura.
<s> Do you want me to go...?
<s> If I don't 'grow up...'
<s> It's over!
<s> From the magazine?
<s> No. At Chelsea Childcare. Okay. Look, call me Monday, hey? I'm late for work.
<s> Well, maybe you better do that, then.  You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores.
<s> ...I'm sure you do...
<s> ...I understand...
<s> Yes.
<s> Thanks, Franky.
<s> Yeah.
<s> ...I get these people to trust you -- they're coming here tomorrow by the way -- I get this expert doctor to talk to you. I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months. You're 'sposed to be in court. I bet you haven't even seen the file.
<s> Don't touch anything.
<s> What?
<s> ...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case.
<s> I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
<s> Read me what she said.
<s> We got to talk.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
<s> Yes, that's correct.
<s> The Big Boy did...?
<s> I'm looking for some Pacific-Tech professors...
<s> How can you say that when you don't know him!
<s> Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
<s> You never know where you're going to wind up when you go to a square dance!
<s> It's gone now.
<s> Southwest of Corona, somewhere. There must have been another cylinder down here.  They've been through this whole area and cleared everybody out.  There's a farmhouse.  Let's see if we can find something to eat...!
<s> Don't you live at home?
<s> It was...  ...one of them!
<s> Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
<s> You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
<s> I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.
<s> It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
<s> Right.
<s> We sell the tamales, enchiladas - hot dogs!
<s> Welcome to California!
<s> He's excited about the script.  You should be too.  It stars you.
<s> Chase...
<s> You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
<s> Okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
<s> No.
<s> Just for a few hours.  Julie'll be with you.
<s> Don't let the bedbugs bite.
<s> Not sleepy.
<s> Coming for you...
<s> I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.
<s> Yeah...how'd you know?
<s> That's my memory.  And it seemed absolutely real.
<s> Kids know when something's bugging a parent.  You've got no idea who this is calling?
<s> Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...
<s> They wouldn't let me...
<s> It can be captured, sometimes.
<s> Current version.  For ten years he's been imprisoned as Freddy by the story of Nightmare on Elm Street.  But now that the films have stopped-  The genie's out of the bottle, Heather, that's what the nightmares are about. That's what I'm writing.
<s> Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
<s> Your father?
<s> Guilty.
<s> Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
<s> Give me some time to Blow the man down!
<s> Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
<s> It was an act of God for Christ's sake.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> Whatever.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Figured what out?
<s> Because it looks good.
<s> Like this!
<s> Like you really care.  Like any of you give a shit what happens to me.
<s> I guess.
<s> That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.
<s> Yes.
<s> I know you will.
<s> I can't watch this.
<s> Come on man, what'd they look like?
<s> How do you know?  They might.
<s> Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
<s> Jesus, you never told them?
<s> What are you talking about.
<s> Unfurl the squares!
<s> Face what?
<s> It's his father sir.  He's suffocating him.  We've all seen it...
<s> They have every right Chuck.
<s> Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross is considered a very good omen.  It is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on.  It's very bad luck if you kill one.  And dolphins too.
<s> I can take care of myself.
<s> Look, you put me on this boat in the first place.  I didn't want to come but I did.  Why do you have to embarrass me.  Why can't you just leave me alone?
<s> I can show you how to use a slide rule.
<s> Why would you do that?
<s> Shut up donut.
<s> On the dog watch, night after the storm, I look down into the skylight above Skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down.
<s> I don't have to listen to this.
<s> It seems we're short on singers.
<s> Barometer's dropping.  The first blow'll come from the south.  Might get interesting.
<s> Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe...
<s> Sir.
<s> The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
<s> Excellent.  Bill, find Mr. Weathers a position to suit his condition.
<s> You already have.  Now go on.  Do it.
<s> What?
<s> I don't know...
<s> I am accountable.
<s> I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
<s> So you're gonna be needin' the "blue- bird" pretty soon?
<s> We don't have no paper bags.
<s> Ready for another?
<s> I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
<s> Hey... I never said you was a pussy... Always figured you had the big ol' round balls for this kind'a thing... Sure would set you and that pretty little girl up good.
<s> Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
<s> Got enough, thanks. We're lookin' for a place has some music, where we can maybe do some dancin' - get somethin' to eat, too. Anything like that around here?
<s> Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
<s> No sir...
<s> We were. Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and I are on our way back to Utila, in the morning.
<s> Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
<s> United States Marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. I have it here, in my briefcase.
<s> Woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didn't understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebody's cat would eat it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap.
<s> Sailor... Lula loves you.
<s> I couldn't say, which one?
<s> This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
<s> How's that?
<s> The real joke is we never went fishing, but we're still fishing.
<s> Oh God... OH GOD... Santos... Oh God Marietta... are you in on this?... OH GOD!!!
<s> Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
<s> Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city.
<s> Seven tomorrow evenin'. We can eat at Galatoire's. Fix it.
<s> Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
<s> Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
<s> All I have to do is grab my suitcase, and I'm ready. You're lucky cause I happen to love night drivin'.
<s> That so?  You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?
<s> Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was.  This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.
<s> What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
<s> It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
<s> Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don't exaggerate.
<s> Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but we'll try her.
<s> Come look at this.
<s> Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'.
<s> It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
<s> Under a hundred.
<s> I can't take no more of this radio...  I ain't never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life, Sailor Ripley, you find me some dancin' music right this minute... I MEAN IT!!
<s> I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.
<s> My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
<s> I don't know, honey, but we gotta help that girl - get her to a town and hope no one catches on I broke parole.
<s> No radio or TV...
<s> Love you, too.
<s> And Bobby too, I hear...
<s> We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
<s> Shake hands with your daddy.
<s> SAILOR!!!!
<s> You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
<s> Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.
<s> No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.
<s> I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
<s> What if I asked you not to?
<s> Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
<s> No... But...
<s> You fucker, don't you ever touch Lula - You fucker, I'll kill you.
<s> Well?...
<s> Thanks...
<s> Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?
<s> Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me.
<s> We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
<s> Isn't she?
<s> Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.
<s> I know. He started it Fall semester.
<s> Just go around him.
<s> Back up. Go out the other way.
<s> What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
<s> Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
<s> So sensitive.
<s> I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
<s> So what's the problem?
<s> He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.
<s> Do you know he won't expel him?
<s> I peeked.
<s> Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> I have to see her. As soon as possible.
<s> Stop calling me Vernon.
<s> Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
<s> Are you there to not reconcile with her?
<s> ...You carry firearms.
<s> Sounds like a good one.
<s> It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
<s> I'll miss my bus.
<s> No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought --
<s> Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
<s> No thanks. I'm fine without them.
<s> I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something.  I guess you really miss her, huh?
<s> Who?
<s> That's a big book you're writing.
<s> Blocked.
<s> Hm.
<s> Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?
<s> Maybe...
<s> Carvel? Where's Carvel?
<s> Amazing.
<s> Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself.
<s> That's right. That one.
<s> She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through.
<s> I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.
<s> Arsonist's Daughter meant something.
<s> Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
<s> I don't know... 'Episodes.'
<s> Okay.
<s> It's Walter's dog and yes, she does know. But let's spare her the details. Come on, your shoes are in the hail.
<s> I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner.
<s> That good, huh?
<s> Chancellor.
<s> I got the message you called too.
<s> Well then. I'd better show you. Terry --
<s> She's left before...
<s> I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
<s> Is the thing -- is it over?
<s> Don't. I know what you're going to say.
<s> Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
<s> Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
<s> I know that. I know what's at stake here...
<s> It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
<s> I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
<s> What's that?
<s> It's Grady, Walter.
<s> Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
<s> Sick.
<s> Her husband.
<s> I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
<s> Give me a break, Grady.
<s> The perpetrator.
<s> Just kidding.
<s> No, I'm going ho --
<s> I haven't heard of half of those.
<s> You find me a decent place for under three hundred a month in this town, and I'll happily move out of this crap neighborhood.
<s> When can I see her?
<s> How old is Anna?
<s> This little table is one heavy bitch.
<s> It was a beautiful present.
<s> Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
<s> I'm not a monster.
<s> When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
<s> You'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you'll see here. Last week I saw a purple martin. And the week before that, I saw a solitary vireo. That's rare.
<s> It's good to listen to your daddy.
<s> Cop.
<s> I don't know.
<s> What?
<s> You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
<s> I have a passionate girlfriend.
<s> Would you like to sit on my lap?
<s> That's okay... doesn't matter.
<s> Your daddy will always love you.
<s> Yes?
<s> I said the job is okay.
<s> Of course.
<s> Honest? No.
<s> I don't need someone else.
<s> Have to talk about something.
<s> I'm not that crazy.
<s> Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
<s> I couldn't say.
<s> I don't.
<s> They usually tell me.
<s> Why?
<s> Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up!  I smelled her hair.
<s> That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
<s> It was a small house.
<s> I smelled her hair. That's it. I just liked smelling her hair.
<s> Are you okay?
<s> Me?
<s> I thought you were a dyke.
<s> What do you think?
<s> You must hate it.
<s> Not tonight.
<s> Don't tell me I'm not a fucking asshole when I know I'm a fucking asshole!
<s> The morning?
<s> Hi.
<s> I molested little girls.
<s> What?
<s> I know.
<s> Which brother did this?
<s> Not ever?
<s> I think it's a fucking good idea.
<s> Fine.
<s> Do you want to talk about it?
<s> Not when they fly.
<s> Missile compartment.  Those are the launch tubes.
<s> I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
<s> It's trying to communicate.
<s> Now what?
<s> You noticed.
<s> I don't know, look around.
<s> What's the plan?
<s> WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??
<s> I can't afford slack, Brigman.
<s> That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
<s> Why bring it here?
<s> Got it. Over.
<s> Yuh?
<s> I can't... make it... podner.
<s> Missed what?
<s> Not us.  Not human.  Get it?  Something non- human, but intelligent...
<s> Just hold your water, okay?  So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?
<s> Neutron counter's not showing very much.
<s> Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  We're on a tight timeline.
<s> Shut up, Hippy.  Bud, how you doing?
<s> What kind of luminous things, Bud?
<s> Perry, stand by on the ROV.  Sorry about this, little buddy.  Better you than me, know what I mean?
<s> Through three miles of water?   I don't know.
<s> She'll wait.
<s> What could be more restful than this?...  Excuse me, what is it that you want to try?
<s> So, it will just take you a little longer to get over it.
<s> And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
<s> What! After giving us such a run around...
<s> I'm certainly not going to swim across.
<s> It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
<s> All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.
<s> More so than the shark?
<s> Could be. They're the kind of people who are capable of anything.
<s> And why do you tell us this only now?
<s> Yes.
<s> It takes even less.
<s> I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.
<s> But why, Claudia?... Why?
<s> Why?
<s> I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close the door.
<s> What do you think?
<s> I'll go even further and say that her presence here -- I don't want to sound offensive -- could be a great hindrance.
<s> So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
<s> And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
<s> I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
<s> Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...
<s> From Panarea. Why?
<s> If women's breasts were colored, yours would be blue...
<s> Take it easy, Raimondo. Why are you getting so impatient?
<s> Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?
<s> You really must do me this one favor.
<s> Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
<s> ... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
<s> Who told you this?
<s> Oh my dear child.
<s> Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
<s> Dear Jesus...
<s> What would you like to talk about.
<s> Right now?
<s> And then what?
<s> Is that where they say it came from... ?
<s> No.
<s> No... do you?
<s> No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
<s> Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
<s> I don't know.
<s> You'll laugh.
<s> Everything... I don't have children.
<s> She watches... she listens.
<s> No I'm not.
<s> To help me.
<s> But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
<s> It came out of me.
<s> No.
<s> Someone's following me.
<s> Above the bed?  Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different?  What is it?
<s> What do you think it's there for?
<s> They can't hear me that's why.  Oh God... I don't wanna...
<s> Yes.
<s> Agnes... Agnes...
<s> I put her to sleep.
<s> Sister...
<s> Marty, what are you doing here?
<s> You got to be crazy.
<s> If I find anything I'll call you.
<s> It's gone on long enough. You're out.
<s> I remember when you was a little girl Marie. You come back from the movies and you'd say - Mama that ending was so sad... and I'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in Hollywood.  And you believed me.
<s> How do you survive?
<s> Uh huh.
<s> What business is it of yours..?
<s> Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
<s> Yes, but I...
<s> I am not with the Inquisition.
<s> From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
<s> One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
<s> That possibility never occurred to you?
<s> I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
<s> I hate ignorance and stupidity.
<s> ... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
<s> Answers.
<s> Yes.
<s> What is it?
<s> What sheets?
<s> Yes.
<s> She drank too much. That's what killed her.
<s> I don't think I care to know.
<s> You just said...
<s> All right?
<s> Saint Peter?
<s> Oh, you've come a long way baby.
<s> There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
<s> You're what?
<s> If you believe this is murder, it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. And definitely not Agnes.
<s> Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
<s> Bet you're only eight and a half.
<s> Isn't it always the way? Picking on us little fellas.
<s> And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
<s> Aren't you supposed to be in that box?
<s> Spoil sport!
<s> Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
<s> I've made the scene.
<s> No, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins.
<s> Oh, my God, he's a natural.
<s> She's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.
<s> A butcher?
<s> Now what's that supposed to mean?
<s> No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.
<s> If I let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me?
<s> Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
<s> Is it ... is it, really?
<s> No.  I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.
<s> Yes.
<s> Why selfish?
<s> Is she?
<s> Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
<s> Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
<s> Oh ... I dunno.
<s> What?
<s> Eh?
<s> I'll look after meself.
<s> It's your nose, y'see. Fans are funny that way. Take a dislike to things. They'll pick on a nose...
<s> A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
<s> We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
<s> You're undressed. Where are your clothes?
<s> Shall I?
<s> Don't be callous.
<s> Foreign devil ...
<s> Of course, he's concealed about me person.
<s> Well you're not going.
<s> Oh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting for you in the studio.
<s> I would have said so.
<s> Is it? Is it really?
<s> Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?
<s> Have done, and you lot get your pens out.
<s> Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
<s> Well, give a couple of minutes ...
<s> That's too easy for Lennon.
<s> Nerves.
<s> You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.
<s> A proper Aborigine.
<s> Is that you, Roby?
<s> No.  Just some horrible dreams about smothering.  Where are we?
<s> What's the terrain down there?
<s> Receiving.
<s> No, you'll follow me.
<s> Well, the sun just came up again, and it seems the wind's died down. It's as clear as a bell outside. There's something I think you ought to see.
<s> Take a look.
<s> What is it, I can't --
<s> I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
<s> Has the hull been breached?
<s> Hard to say.
<s> Yeah!
<s> Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.
<s> Don't know -- maybe we'll be real lucky and he just broke his neck.  I knew we shouldn't of come down here.
<s> Right.
<s> What?
<s> No, I don't want us separated.
<s> We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers.
<s> Ask him.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> At least it can't get up here now.
<s> The flamethrower needs more fuel.
<s> What we really need is some red meat in here for bait.
<s> Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full.  I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as... 
<s> Just can that crap!  I'm in command here till Chaz returns!  And nobody's leaving this ship!
<s> What is it -- I can't tell anything --
<s> Hey!  what about the film?
<s> I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.
<s> Our lives are more important. Anyway, we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat.
<s> We can use the flamethrower.
<s> They're from a dead civilization; they're spores from a tomb.  God knows how long they've been here.
<s> Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.
<s> That tube must be depositing it in him.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Right.  Fire up all systems.
<s> Sandy, contact traffic control.
<s> Well, it's finally happened.
<s> Turn on navigation lights.
<s> Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
<s> I don't even know what I'm looking for.
<s> Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
<s> He went into the pyramid alone.  We lost radio contact with him.  When we pulled him out, it was on his face. It won't come off, not without injuring him.
<s> Go ahead, Jay.
<s> What do you think?  Now we go in.
<s> By eating our food supplies.
<s> Well... yes... there's a pattern... but it's meaningless to me.
<s> So the next step should be --
<s> ... More spores coming.
<s> Can we get to him?
<s> It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it.
<s> And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
<s> But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
<s> The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
<s> Do you wanna head back and call it in?
<s> Keep trying!
<s> Match it!
<s> Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.
<s> Yeah, I got it.
<s> It's moving slow.  About... eleven metres. On the left.
<s> No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy...
<s> Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Compensate!
<s> Is that a fact.
<s> 'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
<s> Ackland?  I don't know him well enough to say.  If we were back on Earth we could run him though an Aldhoven test and find out for sure. There's not much we can do out here.
<s> What do I think?  I think if those Marines from Powell don't shift their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn't.
<s> Miss Harrington's resting, Mr. deWitt. She asked me to see who it is...
<s> It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
<s> Phoebe.
<s> I call myself Phoebe.
<s> I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.
<s> Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
<s> I'm not enough for a paragraph.
<s> Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.
<s> That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
<s> Lloyd and I.
<s> - something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars...
<s> We decided the night before last, before we came up here...
<s> I don't know what I take you for anything...
<s> - it's important right now that we talk. Killer to killer.
<s> Not with me, you're no champion. You're stepping way up in class.
<s> A dull cliche.
<s> So does the history of the world for the past twenty years. I don't enjoy putting it as bluntly as this, frankly I had hoped that you would, somehow, have known - have taken it for granted that you and I...
<s> Then if you won't get out, I'll have you thrown out.
<s> I was there, I saw you and heard you through the dressing room door!
<s> Yes, Addison.
<s> Couldn't go on? You'll give the performance of your life.
<s> As soon as the peasants stop pawing her.
<s> It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
<s> Over? It can't be. I've come to read with her. I promised Max.
<s> A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
<s> I'm a junk yard.
<s> Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
<s> Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
<s> As of this moment you're six years old...
<s> Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
<s> You're in a beehive, pal, didn't you know? We're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night-  - aren't we, honey?
<s> You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
<s> Don't mix your metaphors.
<s> What a body, what a voice.
<s> I'm trying terribly hard.
<s> Here we go...
<s> You've been all through that with Lloyd-
<s> I didn't know Eve Harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon!
<s> I think you do know but you won't or can't tell me.  I said before it was going to be my last try, and I meant it. I can't think of anything else to do. I wish I could.  We usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down. Then it comes up again and everything's fine. But not this time.  You know there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people. Goodbye, Margo.
<s> That suddenly makes the whole thing believable.
<s> Hear, hear...
<s> He does not exaggerate. I was good.
<s> You didn't have to tell me.
<s> I have a suggestion.  There's really not much time left - I mean, you haven't had a minute alone yet, and - well, I could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket... if you'd like.
<s> You're quite a girl.
<s> You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...
<s> Just because you can't even work a zipper. It was very thoughtful, Eve, and I appreciate it-
<s> Miss Harrington...
<s> You were just looking around...
<s> What for?
<s> I might.
<s> Some Hollywood movie star, her plane got in late.
<s> I don't intend to be.
<s> Let's not get over-dramatic.
<s> He's not my friend. You were my friends...
<s> I wish I could believe that.
<s> Something most important you can do.
<s> It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
<s> But not all of it - not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.
<s> Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
<s> There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.
<s> 'Remembrance'.
<s> Well - if I'm not in the way...
<s> They are lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?
<s> Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
<s> I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-
<s> Hi.  "Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't think you can rightly say we lost the wah, we was mo' stahved out, you might say - an' that's what ah don' unnerstand about all these plays about love-stahved Suth'n women - love is one thing we was nevah stahved for the South!"
<s> They're your fans, your audience-
<s> Harrington.
<s> Isn't that what they always say?
<s> Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
<s> Well...
<s> About what?
<s> I just can't believe it.
<s> I can't believe Eve said those things!
<s> The critics thought so, the audiences certainly think so - packed houses, tickets for months in advance - I can't see that either of Lloyd's last two plays have hurt you any!
<s> Just a little skid, that's all. This road's like glass.
<s> The cynicism you refer to, I acquired the day I discovered I was different from little boys!
<s> They'd die without each other.
<s> Such as?
<s> That was way back...
<s> Margo, you haven't got any age.
<s> I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
<s> It seems almost inconceivable that I haven't seen her backstage, but with so many people loitering around... well, well. So Eve is not working for Max after all-  - Max you sly puss.
<s> Go ahead, please...
<s> Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
<s> I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
<s> But what could she do?
<s> Not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill!
<s> Yeah?
<s> Let me lay a little theory on you--
<s> Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system.
<s> I lived here all my life, I got a million contacts, but they're all bus boys and bellhops.
<s> I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
<s> We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.
<s> --shit--
<s> How high up, which Republicans?
<s> The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
<s> So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergate--maybe that was just a piece--
<s> If he self-destructed.
<s> It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.
<s> It's nothing personal, though. 
<s> Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
<s> Maybe we are...
<s> Goddamnit!--
<s> Whatever.
<s> I'm so glad.
<s> Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
<s> At USC, you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking.  Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?
<s> You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
<s> Sloan knew which five, didn't he? 
<s> Routine--I'd just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say "go ahead, give out the money."
<s> --let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
<s> OK.  You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General-- the man who represented law in America-- is a crook.  Just be right, huh?
<s> This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
<s> I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
<s> Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
<s> Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
<s> I couldn't say.
<s> It is.
<s> I would, if you really ever wanted to know.
<s> You can't believe that.
<s> --political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell?--
<s> --can we use their names?--
<s> --well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
<s> As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
<s> When so ordered.
<s> A girl. Melissa.
<s> No, none of those.
<s> Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that?
<s> Mochaccino.  Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.
<s> Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
<s> You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen minute round trip.
<s> Seduce her.
<s> Of course, I didn't --
<s> Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
<s> You can't sing at the competition.
<s> ...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
<s> No.  I'm missing the game for you.
<s> Then don't.
<s> Yeah right.
<s> Did you guys hook up or something?
<s> Yeah, I'm the best, baby.
<s> Nothing, I just hugged her back.
<s> No, "Charming" is old.  "Older" is <u>really</u> old.  "Youthful mind" is dead.
<s> You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
<s> Went home to shit.
<s> Shut up.  You're supposed to be supportive.
<s> Nothing!
<s> Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
<s> Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
<s> Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
<s> Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
<s> Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
<s> Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!
<s> So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
<s> Oh -- no way.  I can't do that to her.
<s> I thought so.
<s> Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
<s> How?
<s> Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
<s> Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
<s> What?!  How do I do that?
<s> What's that?
<s> You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch?
<s> Then where does a blowjob figure in?
<s> Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
<s> Attitude?  Me?  I think that <u>you</u> guys should be more enthusiastic.  Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!
<s> Stifler!!
<s> Yep.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> Just like sex with my wife.
<s> A-duh... You're a werewolf. And we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
<s> What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
<s> Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
<s> Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
<s> Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir.
<s> Andy!
<s> Serafine...?
<s> Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.
<s> So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
<s> Ahh, Rodin. Mmm! He's the fuc-  I mean, he's the best. You must go to the Rodin sculpture garden, in the huitieme, it's so beautiful.
<s> Andy! No!
<s> Yeah. French fries...
<s> It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
<s> All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
<s> Really.
<s> After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
<s> Andy...
<s> "Fuck"? You think I don't know this word "fuck"? Is that how you talk to policemen in America?
<s> My uncle's in a coma you moron!
<s> Looks like he lied to you too.
<s> Oh shit... No...
<s> What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... 
<s> You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
<s> I went to St. Severin church.  Now look -
<s> Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...
<s> Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
<s> Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
<s> Good man. Now can I have my arms back?
<s> Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo.
<s> How to read.
<s> I know, but I had to because . . .
<s> Then come find me.
<s> I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess!  Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly...
<s> Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
<s> Now just get off the train.
<s> You shouldn't have pushed us!
<s> Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
<s> It used to be a private yacht before the government took it over.
<s> Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta make your own way in the world! Don't be sorry for me! I'm going to get what I want don't you worry!
<s> I'll never let go!
<s> No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
<s> Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
<s> She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.
<s> Me? No. Rich food - it kills me. Ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces?
<s> Ew. . .  the honest type.
<s> Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
<s> Pray he's color-blind...
<s> Ah! Let us begin!
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Watch me.
<s> You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
<s> What?
<s> Who are you?
<s> Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
<s> Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
<s> Alright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay?
<s> What-what-I don't... It's not natural! We're sleeping in a bed together. You know, it's been a long time.
<s> Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
<s> Me? Oh, downtown!
<s> Yeah, well, I'm, but I...
<s> You keep it nice.  Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Oh, yeah.
<s> Fifteen years, yeah.
<s> think that's, uh-
<s> you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.
<s> No, I'm not gonna letcha. You have a great voice.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
<s> Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.
<s> Good? I was-
<s> M'hm.  You're not gonna believe this, but-
<s> M'hm.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
<s> I have a tiny apartment.
<s> You don't want me to live with you?
<s> It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
<s> Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
<s> No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
<s> I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
<s> It's Easter. You know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat. I think they're gonna really like you.
<s> Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
<s> That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
<s> I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
<s> It was just great!
<s> Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
<s> I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
<s> It's for my complexion.
<s> That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
<s> Hey, can yuh watch the road? Watch the --
<s> I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
<s> Yeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- A pat on the androgynous side. But it's...
<s> Oh-
<s> You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
<s> What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read "Death in Venice."
<s> You're mad, aren't you?
<s> Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.
<s> You should be ashamed of yourself.
<s> "Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?  he said as he removed her brassiere..."
<s> Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?
<s> The only word for this is trans- plendid. It's trans-plendid.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
<s> He's screaming his opinions in my ear.
<s> Tell him.
<s> Hey.
<s> Whatta you mean?
<s> May I see your license, please?
<s> Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-
<s> You're crazy!
<s> What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
<s> Oh, Max... no, I maybe I better lie down.
<s> If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out. It'd probably wreck her. But I should be honest.
<s> Oh, yes, yes.
<s> You think so? Do you really?
<s> I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
<s> I was a great beauty.
<s> A long time.
<s> It's the way they do things.
<s> A triumph.  When did you get here?
<s> Absolutely not.
<s> She's got great tits.
<s> What?
<s> Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
<s> Five years ago, I was at the party, remember?
<s> It's alright, isn't it?
<s> It's an object lesson in grace.  Wow!  Look who's here before me!  My leading man is on time for once.
<s> How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious.  You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
<s> Borrow whatever you like.
<s> You want a Tylenol, or something?
<s> You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
<s> I can't think how you gave it all up, Soph.
<s> And you're not the wife.
<s> What a nose.  You missed your calling.
<s> Sally?
<s> Harry called.
<s> She's in ICU.
<s> Monica.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
<s> Forget it, Judy.
<s> Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
<s> Not as a rule.
<s> Anytime, sport.
<s> I adore him.
<s> He's directing now.
<s> That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
<s> I'm ready.
<s> Ryan's novel.
<s> Hardly...
<s> Through the sweats or not?
<s> No.  I missed that.
<s> For good.
<s> Skye!  I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually.  You read the book again?  Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again.  If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park.  Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right.  It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left.
<s> And Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a rock star in London.  His novels sell millions.
<s> Okay.  Last one to find Otis is a smelly old bum.
<s> It's alright.  Be our guests.
<s> He'll find his way back.
<s> This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
<s> That is not true.
<s> Hello?  Last birthday was?
<s> This is insanity.  Sally...
<s> You're not ready.
<s> Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?
<s> Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
<s> Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
<s> Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
<s> I meant Sally.
<s> In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
<s> Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> No you're not.
<s> I will treasure this.
<s> Here, drink this.  Drink lots of water.  Hold on to this.  Take deep breaths. Nice and slow.  Would you like a lolly?
<s> I think he's really angry with me too.
<s> I like you.
<s> I'm so sorry.
<s> Trust him.
<s> Not good.
<s> I'm sure you understand.
<s> Not at all.
<s> Yes.
<s> Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
<s> If he were still alive, maybe.
<s> Are you asking me to marry you?
<s> Who told you that?  No.  I'm twenty...  Five.
<s> Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
<s> "Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here."
<s> What does that mean?
<s> Why don't you go fuck yourself?
<s> No, really, five thousand with your discount.
<s> Yes.  Fine.
<s> I'll be right out.
<s> Evie has a little something for you.
<s> You weren't exactly horrified.
<s> But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
<s> This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
<s> I'm new...I was born yesterday.
<s> Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen, you can share my rations.
<s> That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!
<s> Invisible!
<s> Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
<s> I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
<s> Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
<s> Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
<s> Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --
<s> I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
<s> Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
<s> Well I guess that makes us even.
<s> <u>I</u> ruined <u>your</u> life?  Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was <u>happily miserable</u>.
<s> Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again?
<s> Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
<s> Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
<s> Well...no, but --
<s> Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
<s> You held onto this all that time?
<s> I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
<s> Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
<s> Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
<s> Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
<s> Outstanding.  Princess...?
<s> I've never seen anything like it, General, they're they're...well, look!
<s> Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --
<s> Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
<s> Terrific!  You <u>should</u> feel insignificant!
<s> I'll be back.
<s> I'm not in the mood.  Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
<s> You're a real buddy.
<s> You heard the ant -- DIG!!!
<s> Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger -- but for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.
<s> That's me. 
<s> You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
<s> Good night.
<s> Would you like to?
<s> What time does the show go on?
<s> I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
<s> Of course not.
<s> Why?
<s> I don't understand --
<s> I'm so tired -- DR. DREYFUSS Here -- drink this.
<s> No -- I don't want anything.
<s> Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.
<s> In his apartment.
<s> He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.
<s> Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
<s> I'm not very good at it.
<s> Was he really upset when you told him?
<s> It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
<s> As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty good cook -- but I'm a lousy housekeeper.
<s> I wouldn't say that --  What would you like to have for diner? There's onion soup and canned asparagus --
<s> That's very wise.
<s> That's funny -- so am I.  What did you do with the cards?
<s> I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter -- this is a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.  Come on, Oscar.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> In 1957, we had an employee here, name of Fowler. He was very popular, too. Turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the Actuarial Department tying up the switchboard, figuring the odds on our I.B.M. machines -- so the day before the Kentucky Derby, I called in the Vice Squad and we raided the thirteenth floor.
<s> Are you going to deny it?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
<s> No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
<s> Roger. And I'll get that other key.
<s> I hate to disturb you, but something came up -- it's rather important -- and I think it would be a good idea if you could see me -- at the apartment -- as soon as possible.
<s> Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
<s> Mine?
<s> How's that again?
<s> Thank you, sir.
<s> Save it. The old payola won't work any more. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
<s> I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --
<s> Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.
<s> Of course not.  But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?
<s> It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
<s> Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
<s> You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
<s> Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.
<s> Wednesday -- Wednesday --  I got somebody penciled in -- let me see what I can do -- I'll get back to you.
<s> Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!
<s> Just as long as she's okay.
<s> I don't know. All I know is I got to get out of this place.
<s> Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.  By the way, whatever happened to her?
<s> Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
<s> Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.
<s> Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
<s> Good night.
<s> Get more coffee.
<s> Mr. Baxter -- nineteenth floor.
<s> You can't sleep.  Come on, Fran -- open your eyes.  Let's get her walking. We've got to keep her awake for the next couple of hours.
<s> I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
<s> And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
<s> Like old times. Same booth, same song --
<s> -- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
<s> For a while there, you try kidding yourself that you're going with an unmarried man. Then one day he keeps looking at his watch, and asks you if there's any lipstick showing, then rushes off to catch the seven-fourteen to White Plains. So you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee -- and you sit there by yourself -- and you think -- and it all begins to look so ugly --
<s> We didn't talk about it -- you did.
<s> Okay. I'm sorry.
<s> Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.
<s> I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
<s> Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.
<s> Baxter?
<s> I told you -- with my mother.
<s> What gives?
<s> Lovely. You were a big help.
<s> See if they'll what?
<s> I like all of them --
<s> I will -- I assure you that -- You got a fifty on that H-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em --
<s> I know, I know, it's all right. Come in this way. It's mined over there. This way. It's all right.
<s> Moonby. Got any Winstons?
<s> Yeah. Way north.
<s> A long time.
<s> What did you put in all those ammo boxes?
<s> No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere --
<s> I don't believe you --
<s> God knows.
<s> Thirty meters up, Lance; I saw the fucking flash.
<s> Who knows what's up there?
<s> Thta's not Charlie's work --
<s> Signs?
<s> Would he remember you ?
<s> Yeah, it still runs.
<s> What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
<s> We ain't goin' down the river.
<s> Charlie?
<s> He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.
<s> They must have seen the fire.
<s> Okay, Willard, sit down.
<s> Well, he's killing now.
<s> The Vietnamese think it's theirs -- I guess the Americans do, too.
<s> Do you know that jungle?
<s> Thank you, sir.
<s> Sure -- fine --
<s> Yeah -- yeah, I can understand how you feel.
<s> Wh -- what?
<s> Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
<s> When did you hear?
<s> Music?
<s> We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help.
<s> Yeah, I like it...
<s> I'm taking you back. You can still live.
<s> Just something I read in the Free Press.
<s> Which one's the Colonel's?
<s> Sure.
<s> No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him.
<s> Bring your rifles, that's all.  Take us to him.
<s> You're Australian?
<s> No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy.
<s> No. Not really.
<s> What things?
<s> Son of a bitch, sir.
<s> Straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where else you think he'd be?
<s> 89   CONTINUED:
<s> 134  CONTINUED:  
<s> Keep back.
<s> Why?
<s> I bet you haven't had lunch.
<s> Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around to find us.
<s> You make it sound like a prison sentence.
<s> It's exactly what you meant.
<s> I've got an idea.  We'll have to work fast.
<s> I know.  Least you didn't shoot all of them.
<s> Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.
<s> No big deal.  We just got off on the wrong foot.  What's your name?
<s> -- Killing is what you know.  Pack some food while I prep for the flight.  I'm sure not gonna let him go.
<s> We've got another two hours of daylight.
<s> Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
<s> You don't know how true that is.
<s> Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
<s> No, I better stay at my post.
<s> Don't try me.  I'll kill you if it comes to it.
<s> I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
<s> -- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
<s> -- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
<s> What does this matter to you?
<s> That's what we should've done in the first place.
<s> Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
<s> Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was trouble.  What about you, big shot?  Do something.  Who's side are you on, anyway?
<s> Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
<s> I'm right fuckin' here with you.
<s> Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.  If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this.
<s> They'll have to come right past us.
<s> I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
<s> Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr...
<s> Don't be silly. How bad?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> I'm a waitress.
<s> Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
<s> Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
<s> How old are you?
<s> If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty.
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
<s> I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
<s> Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
<s> Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
<s> Nonsense!
<s> Yes... sure.  I'll take the sofa.
<s> That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
<s> It's one idea...
<s> Were you asleep?
<s> See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
<s> Okay.
<s> No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer than you think. I give the wrong impression sometimes and...
<s> Don't want to. I love you.
<s> No. No. Get Carol.
<s> Two years ago...
<s> What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
<s> Hope you find him. I love that dog.
<s> Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
<s> Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
<s> No, it's all right. I'll just watch.
<s> See, he's right. I need the cards.  Simon, you're broke.
<s> Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
<s> Well, that's a load off.
<s> Got any easier questions?
<s> No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
<s> Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
<s> I forgot to lock the door.
<s> Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
<s> Where?
<s> Didn't you here all them sirens? It's been all over the radio.  Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma.
<s> You're right.  Talking too much again.
<s> What?  You think I'm running you up?
<s> We both know what you were doing.
<s> After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
<s> There's a sand barricade up ahead; I'm going to ram this cab into it. The cab has an airbag, odds are good I'll survive.  But with this steel casing and bullet proof glass, odds for you are not so good.
<s> I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
<s> Oh, yeah.
<s> Now I'll tell you something.  It wouldn't fucking matter if I offered you one hundred million dollars. You'd still be thinking the same thing, that you're going to take me. And here I am, sitting through this, knowing it's bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing I can think is that, in just a few minutes I'm going to take you.
<s> What?
<s> The contract was stolen.
<s> A new player.  He's using the name Nicholai.
<s> Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist.
<s> I bet you fucking know!
<s> Robert?  Robert?
<s> One hour per man.
<s> What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
<s> Yes.
<s> This is something that is never going to end.  You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  And that's going to take money, a lot of money.
<s> If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
<s> Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment.  He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets.  He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books.  If you keep a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled.  If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.
<s> Why?
<s> He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
<s> He was killed.
<s> The C.I.A.?
<s> Jesus -- why?
<s> They tried to kill you?
<s> Then you went freelance?
<s> Does that mean it didn't bother you?
<s> Thinking.
<s> Why not?
<s> No.
<s> I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping.
<s> Why don't you bring it out here? It's beautiful out here.
<s> Taiwan.
<s> Okay.  Then what?
<s> That means you won't have a gun.
<s> You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
<s> We split the money?
<s> It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
<s> Why in the hell would you take that chance?
<s> Thank you.
<s> It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
<s> Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
<s> She was taken.
<s> When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
<s> I'm not normal.
<s> How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
<s> No.  They call me, I don't call them.  If they didn't call I wouldn't exist.
<s> Yes.
<s> It's possible.
<s> A dime.
<s> Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
<s> When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
<s> I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?
<s> American currency.
<s> I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate.  Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
<s> Thank you.
<s> And pay for their drinks occasionally.
<s> Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?
<s> It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.
<s> No you don't get it. Every cabby in town knows this joint. So where's the mystery, the danger?
<s> You're outnumbered Kat two to one, got to go with the majority, that's democracy.
<s> Yeah, let's check out the low-life.
<s> What did the beer cost?
<s> No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
<s> We could make a run for it?
<s> Great. Let's say nine o'clock here tomorrow. Catch you later partner.
<s> A locksmith too? Why d'you ever bother with writing?
<s> No....The Asylum!
<s> But how did the wall get here?
<s> Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
<s> They'll never get us.
<s> Look at it this way, it's their contribution. If we'd explained it to them, they'd probably have given it to us anyway.
<s> Forget it Doug, it's no good.
<s> Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
<s> 42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast.
<s> What?
<s> No!
<s> Sure I'm sure!
<s> Do you know the way?
<s> Good we'll take Josh's Jeep, come on!
<s> Yeah....Shit, those guys have guns.
<s> Yes.
<s> Sure, they wanted to know if I ever voted Conservative.
<s> Really?
<s> Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
<s> Ooh, well excuse me.
<s> I'll get the drinks, but not here. Let's split. I can't stand this any more, it's murdering my respect for literature.
<s> How about you Brutus?
<s> Don't worry it's okay!
<s> I'm sorry but it's been a crazy evening. I'm going to make that place into something big. God, I love you!
<s> We should go to the Metro it's quicker.
<s> Everybody is at home, it's no good.
<s> No Kat, I lied to you, I hate England and I don't ever want to live there again.
<s> So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
<s> Great. And your all set for the performance?
<s> Ah, so what?
<s> No, it should be over soon.
<s> Yeah seems okay.
<s> No, just a coffee.
<s> Guests.
<s> Hmm, I still owe him.
<s> Oh shit, yeah. Can you lend some more money?
<s> Thanks, but I don't intend to stay.
<s> First, I want to walk free with a letter, in English, from the Prosecutor General dropping all charges. Second, I want two first class tickets to London leaving tonight and three thousand crowns in a stamped envelope. Lastly, all actions against the students are to be stopped!
<s> Good, wait here, it will not take long and then you may go.
<s> Oh that's it? Everything I do is crap!
<s> What for?
<s> Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
<s> In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
<s> We're not sure...
<s> Some Americans?
<s> Heart be still.
<s> Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
<s> I don't want his money.
<s> He wants to show now.
<s> You're fine like that, Mom.
<s> He wants to talk to you.
<s> Landon, honey. There's nothing more.
<s> I'm just wondering --
<s> York Ave.
<s> Demented.
<s> Later.
<s> -- This your idea of small talk?
<s> 'They won't.'
<s> Then we both know.  I'll point. You drive. Faster.
<s> Like me.
<s> Know so.
<s> You don't miss a thing.
<s> And that would ruin your reputation how?
<s> That sounds like horseshit.
<s> It's not.
<s> I wanted this to be a date.
<s> No.
<s> Fun.
<s> Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
<s> Not possible.
<s> Twice a year.
<s> Yes, one of many.
<s> I'm not applying to college.
<s> Pull over.
<s> The doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible.  I didn't want anyone being -- weird around me.
<s> I used to like yogurt.
<s> You'll be fine for a few minutes.
<s> I don't want you to see him outside school activities.
<s> That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
<s> That won't be possible.
<s> I don't want to see her hurt.
<s> Okay. Sure.  My grandfather. When he was seven, he shook the hand of an old guy, a war vet or something, who had once shaken President Lincoln's hand.  Made a big impression on him.
<s> Praying.
<s> If there is a God, how could he let this happen??!!
<s> In there.
<s> Yes. You?
<s> That's right.  The world is your oyster.
<s> -- You can and you will, Mr. Carter.
<s> You came here to give me my report card?
<s> What do you want, Biff?
<s> Marty. What's for breakfast?
<s> Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise?
<s> How could I forget?  Oh, sure, I remember you.
<s> Nine o' clock.  Oh, I'm late! Maybe I'll see you later.
<s> Good.
<s> You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
<s> I'm going to be at the dance.
<s> Marty. Marty Lewis.
<s> Yeah,  Right.
<s> AM or PM?
<s> Oh, right, right... 
<s> Now hold on a minute, Professor! Hold the phone. Are you trying to tell me that this -- all of this here -- that this is -- it's a -- a --
<s> Why?
<s> Oh. That expression probably hasn't been invented yet... I can get behind -- I agree with you.
<s> That's just great!
<s> Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
<s> Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
<s> But that's impossible!! George asked her out! He had to! I saw him walk her home! Oh, God!
<s> Perfect...
<s> 87 states? Time travel bans? What the hell?
<s> According to your girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies. You went to the restroom and you never came out. Obviously, you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp, created by the original operation of the time machine.
<s> But I told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with. So don't mention anything about time travel to anyone.
<s> Dick Wilson? Dickie Wilson? Dickie Wilson runs this place? That's a laugh!
<s> Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.
<s> Nope.
<s> What're you doing?
<s> Nah, I got me a job.
<s> Great.
<s> Spanish.
<s> I know.
<s> It's your play.
<s> You don't believe me, see for yourself.
<s> Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.
<s> I'm serious.
<s> How about over here?
<s> I just don't want to go.
<s> It's mine all right.
<s> Name is Carruthers. Believe I shoot people every now and then. Not that I deserve a medal.
<s> Wanta sue me?
<s> Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft.
<s> Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?
<s> Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than flapjacks.
<s> There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it-
<s> Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
<s> Not really.  This is pretty important.
<s> Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...
<s> Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
<s> Stole his body?  When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped?  Of course!  What else?
<s> Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
<s> Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
<s> Who?
<s> It's too dangerous.
<s> Sure.  I won't hold my breath.
<s> A what?
<s> Damn John Whorfin--!
<s> Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai.
<s> Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
<s> Where do you hail from, Doc?
<s> Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
<s> Please, Barton.
<s> ...Who is this?
<s> Hah!
<s> That doesn't help anything, Bill.
<s> Drown all those rascals...
<s> And what would that be, son?
<s> Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
<s> Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
<s> Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going – don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
<s> I don't know, Garland; my place is here right now. I feel I'm on the brink of success-
<s> Yeah, I'm fine, Garland – I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.
<s> Okay... a quick one, sure...
<s> That's okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies – though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there,
<s> Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
<s> Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York – hopefully our numbers are growing – who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths – not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
<s> Hell, I could tell you some stories–
<s> Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. Come on in.
<s> Seems like nothing but, lately.
<s> Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started – I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me – my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer.  Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.
<s> In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact – New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
<s> Well...
<s> No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
<s> They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
<s> Funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime – when he can fit it into a little box like that. I guess... I guess it's kind of pathetic.
<s> Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll help you finish your script. You'll think about me...
<s> Because you DON'T LISTEN!
<s> I'm at the Earle.
<s> Thanks, but I wanted a place that was less...
<s> Boy! You writers! Work hard, play hard!  That's what I hear, anyway...
<s> Congratulations.
<s> Must be.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> That's right, Fink, he lives next door to you.
<s> No kidding, bright boy – we smelt Mundt all over this. Was he the idea man?
<s> You're a sick fuck, Fink.
<s> He's a little funny in the head.
<s> Ah, hell, let Bart take a crack at it.  He'll get into the swing of things or I don't know writers. Let's make it a dame, Bart, keep it simple. We don't gotta tackle the world our first time out. The important thing is we all have that Barton Fink feeling, but since you're Barton Fink I'm assuming you have it in spades.  Seriously Bart, I like you. We're off to a good start. Dammit, if all our writers were like you I wouldn't have to get so goddamn involved. I'd like to see something by the end of the week.
<s> Mr. Lipnik, please –
<s> You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd you find?
<s> Thanks.
<s> Bring 1976 up.
<s> Nilsen.
<s> What was she like in school?
<s> My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
<s> You saw all the reports, Beth!
<s> I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here.  Where is he?
<s> What?
<s> Yes.
<s> I've got a degree in psych.  It goes with the turf.  Games are fun.
<s> Thanks.
<s> You know all about me.
<s> Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
<s> I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
<s> What if I call you Nicky?
<s> What do you want from me, Catherine?
<s> No.  I wrote it years afterwards.
<s> No.
<s> I'll meet you there.
<s> Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  I don't do those.
<s> I never have before.
<s> No?
<s> Try me.
<s> Why?
<s> What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?
<s> Of course I knew.
<s> No.
<s> Come over here and tell me no.
<s> No thank you.
<s> No.
<s> The usual -- a girlfriend.
<s> They're executives.  They're nervous about everything.
<s> What are you doing here, Pop?
<s> I don't believe it.
<s> He was I.A.  He probably asked her about it.
<s> How you're saying she killed her parents?  Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too?
<s> Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
<s> You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you?
<s> Did you check all four years?
<s> You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
<s> Oh, I didn't know that.
<s> Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
<s> My jacket? Gee, great...  Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that!
<s> Yeah, I met her already.
<s> That's good. At least they're interested.
<s> My dog, Archie... I woke up with flea bites... Creepy. I ran out and bought flea collars. They work really well.
<s> I don't like beer.
<s> No.
<s> I really think you should talk to him about this.
<s> You haven't been by lately.
<s> Sure.
<s> How do you know?
<s> It's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there.
<s> Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him.
<s> I'm here.
<s> Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
<s> Chateau Latour '64, please.
<s> Use your fucking instinct.
<s> Why don't you try letting her in, Steve – I mean Shenge.
<s> Come on in!
<s> I guess you did.
<s> Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
<s> I do.  I just said that. I was never here before. I actually like it.
<s> It's Monday morning.
<s> You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
<s> Basquiat, what did you take?
<s> It's three thousand dollars!
<s> Hi.
<s> I'd like to squeeze your titties.
<s> Fuck...  I forgot about that.
<s> Thanks again for not inviting me. I'm only here on business.
<s> Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
<s> Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
<s> Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
<s> Right.  Sure.  And "Peace on earth, good will toward men."
<s> Better than you know, Bat-boy.
<s> Y'mean take off our costumes?
<s> But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
<s> Yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope?  Is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?
<s> Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
<s> Your blood, Max.
<s> Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
<s> PMS.
<s> My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
<s> And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?
<s> Oswald:  We need one more thing.
<s> Oh no, those things frighten me.
<s> You came to tuck me in.  That's quite a switch.  I am looking for my brother, Wilfred. He is first butler to the Maharajah of Mirajanpore.  But Mirajanpore is a floating court, it travels across India, so Wilfred can be rather difficult to find.
<s> In spirit only, I'm afraid.
<s> Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
<s> Pheromones?
<s> I recognized the accent.
<s> You'd be surprised.
<s> Divide and conquer.
<s> What exactly are you doing?
<s> I hate being lectured.
<s> Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
<s> Mr. Freeze.
<s> Surf's up.
<s> I can make it.
<s> Just the beast.
<s> She knows who we are.
<s> Dr. Pamela Isley.
<s> Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
<s> But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
<s> I'm betting on you.  You'll make someone a good husband one day. But I can't wait around forever. Don't answer now.  Just think it over.  Here's some food for thought.
<s> Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
<s> Yes!  Yes, I want her so badly I can taste it.  That's the whole point. Look at us.  Orphans.  Isolated. Obsessed to the exclusion of life, love, family.  We're perfect targets. She's done something to us, got us fighting over her somehow.
<s> I always go a size smaller.  Makes me look slimmer.
<s> Kill them.  Of course.  But why stop there?  Why should only Batman and Robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
<s> Adam and Evil.
<s> Not good.
<s> You're skating on thin ice.  My passion thaws for my bride alone.
<s> At you?  Polly want a kiss?
<s> What exactly are you working on in there?  What are those screams?
<s> A few hitches sir, but I'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.
<s> She has an excellent mind.
<s> I wonder if she'd go out with me.
<s> What?
<s> Tonight's a good night.
<s> Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? Well, it's been grand. Sorry you all have to die now.
<s> For _me_? Really? Tell me.
<s> Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone.  Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
<s> Slanta.
<s> And now....
<s> Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me.
<s> Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
<s> I don't want to remember!
<s> I got no place at the circus without my family. I'm going to get a fix on Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill him.
<s> Here. Get a good seat.
<s> You're a genius.
<s> I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
<s> Thank you, Alfred.  I hope you'll excuse me.  It was a great pleasure meeting you.  And you.
<s> Take me. Let the boy go.
<s> Too many people. Come on!  SHIELDS!!
<s> Well -- I think you might consider
<s> I won't let you have it.
<s> How do I know you won't keep them all?
<s> I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
<s> I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !
<s> Take 'em! I want his head!
<s> WHAT?
<s> Eckhardt... our problems are your problems.
<s> What are you, scared of heights?
<s> No wonder you're such a chickenshit.  Now shut up.  There ain't no bat.
<s> Because I want someone I can trust.
<s> Jack?  Thank God.  I can't believe it's you.  I heard you'd been --
<s> I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
<s> Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it.
<s> Miss Vale, was it something I said?  Do you want to sniff my flower?
<s> Too much glamor, huh.  What's in the bag - - Monte Carlo?  Apes in Kenya?
<s> Yeah.  Peanuts.  Which is how he goes through women.
<s> ... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?
<s> ... Okay, then, I have a confession to make.  I'm the Batman.
<s> Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
<s> What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
<s> I need some time, David.  A little time.  It's not just you.  It's partly me.
<s> Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.
<s> Annie, it's me.
<s> Right first time.
<s> Thanks, Annie.
<s> Uh ... yes ...
<s> Well, Ahm....
<s> I don't think you really understand what you're looking at ...
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> There's a man.  I woke up next to a man ...
<s> Sure did.
<s> That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
<s> Yes?
<s> Damn.  I was just going to Number 4 ....
<s> Why thank you sir.
<s> Nope.
<s> What?
<s> Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh heh. Anus. Heh heh.
<s> No it wasn't!
<s> Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.
<s> Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
<s> What a rip-off. Come on. We gotta find that chick.
<s> Huh huh huh.
<s> Huh huh. No way, dude.
<s> Cool! Huh huh huh.
<s> Yeah really. Let's get outta here Beavis. Huh huh huh. This sucks.
<s> Could you, like, tell her we're ready to score?
<s> Dill-wad...
<s> Washington! That's where she was gonna meet up with ya?  Damn, she's goin' all the way!
<s> Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
<s> Sorry to hear that. Me, I took a beating.
<s> That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
<s> Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.
<s> This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.
<s> Cool, huh huh.  Hey Beavis that's that dude that's paying us to do his wife.
<s> It's so nice to meet young men who are so well mannered.
<s> Uh, do you think these two sluts still live in Highland? That would be cool.
<s> I will <u>never</u> sell this house. I'll be buried in my yard next to Barbara.  Holding hands!  And a good paintbrush!
<s> This is going to take some time.
<s> Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
<s> That's all we need.
<s> Look, she's right.  We'll just start simple, honey, be tougher. I feel... confident.  C'mon.
<s> Where are your skulls and bones?
<s> This is different.  Eventually she'll take someone to the attic. And then what?  We've got to try to contact this guy Betelmyer. We gotta get some help, hon.
<s> 3:30 I guess.
<s> <u>Night of the Living Dead</u>?  It's this gross movie.
<s> W... We didn't know how to make one.
<s> Our cemetery?
<s> Funeral.  God, you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>!  What was it like?  The funeral. Did you cry?
<s> Where'd they go?
<s> I think so.
<s> That's it!
<s> You've <u>got</u> to say it!
<s> You've got to help them.
<s> 
<s> He's a cloven-hooved beast!
<s> I am ashamed to say he is.  Look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget it.  You can't get her out of Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
<s> It's too late, Charles.  I'm sorry.
<s> There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese.  They don't know better.
<s> Delia hates it.
<s> Shhhh.  They didn't commit suicide.
<s> Of course, her favorite color! How <u>beautiful</u>!
<s> Attic space.
<s> We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn here, a very sophisticated pair.  We must protect them, treat them with respect, <u>nur</u>ture them.
<s> Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.
<s> My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth!
<s> The attic.
<s> Their wedding clothes.
<s> But not for long...
<s> Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
<s> Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
<s> How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
<s> In a day or two, yes.
<s> To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
<s> I think we'd better go look for him.  David!
<s> And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
<s> No. I like this attic very much.
<s> Yes. He's a very careful driver.
<s> Yes. Thank you.
<s> Hello, Eve.
<s> Yes.
<s> That's good. I like to watch, too.
<s> No, thank you.
<s> Good night, Eve.
<s> Hello, Sid.
<s> The President is a nice person. I enjoyed it very much.
<s> Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
<s> What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The S.E.C.! Damn them!
<s> Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
<s> I see, Ben.
<s> Yes. That is correct.
<s> No, Ben.
<s> Yes. I like to watch very much.
<s> I want to tell Eve.
<s> Yes.
<s> ... Yes sir - elevator!
<s> Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
<s> Yes. I was there with Ben.
<s> Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds.
<s> Yes, Thomas - I understand.
<s> Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
<s> ... Oh, really...
<s> ... Nothing.
<s> Try again.
<s> I said - try again.
<s> Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
<s> I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
<s> Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.
<s> Well, I think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling... He's getting to that age, you know... He really misses you...
<s> Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
<s> We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
<s> Clearly, yes comrade.
<s> Gardiner, yes, sir.
<s> Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
<s> Oh yeah, he's good.
<s> The one where you're that jewel thief.
<s> Who am I thinking of?
<s> I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan!
<s> May 11th.
<s> Yeah. You want a beer?
<s> What?
<s> I'm scared.
<s> Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
<s> I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
<s> What?
<s> We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
<s> Me and John.
<s> Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
<s> Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.
<s> I'm sorry for everything.
<s> Simulates?
<s> Let me try!
<s> That... was... no... simulation.
<s> Schwartz.
<s> Yes?
<s> Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.
<s> Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think.  I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.
<s> The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
<s> Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
<s> The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, there are certain “doors” which should never be opened.
<s> Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> No, really.
<s> How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
<s> Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
<s> What's he been in?
<s> Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
<s> So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
<s> A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution.
<s> No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course the Great Mantini!
<s> Fine. Let's drop it.
<s> Fork ah did?
<s> I'm sure you're not going crazy.
<s> The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
<s> You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
<s> It's Craig in there, I can tell.
<s> Yes, Hi.
<s> Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
<s> A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
<s> Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
<s> Do you mind?
<s> Oh shut up.  Craig, darling are you in there?
<s> You mean with Malkovich?
<s> No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
<s> Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
<s> He's a selfish bastard.
<s> I've got to leave Malkovich.
<s> Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
<s> Whatever.
<s> But you said...you said out there, there ain't no...what was that word?..no..de- fense. No de-fense.
<s> Not like He punished me.
<s> The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
<s> WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
<s> YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
<s> More than all right. Miss Bodwin, she teach me stuff..Book stuff. She says I might go to Oberlin. She's experimenting on me.
<s> Yes?
<s> May I come in?
<s> Yes ma'am..
<s> Ya think?
<s> Fine. But what would I do at night?
<s> Extra?
<s> DO YOU FORGIVE ME?
<s> NO!...She wanted me to do it.
<s> Mama...Mama she's asleep. Why don't you eat something.
<s> Oh I been out.
<s> I don't know him that well.
<s> Ella.
<s> I run him off.
<s> He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at.
<s> Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
<s> Oh yeah. I got big plans.
<s> No use thinking these things now.
<s> I don't want to know.
<s> She ain't crazy. She love those children. She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
<s> Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
<s> Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
<s> No sir, I don't, but I know Plank Road. 'Bout a mile up thataway.
<s> Dude, I finally got the venue I wanted.  I'm Performing my dance quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on Tuesday night, and I'd love it if you came and gave me notes.
<s> Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
<s> And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
<s> You don't know shit, Lebowski.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Yes, so we were informed.  However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
<s> Yeah, but we're--
<s> And this guy peed on it.
<s> Walter, how--
<s> Were you listening to the Dude's story?
<s> I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
<s> Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--
<s> Shut the fuck up, Donny.  This kid is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his father is--are you ready for this?-- Arthur Digby Sellers.
<s> Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash. Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya Tony.
<s> Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
<s> I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
<s> ...Also, my rug was stolen.
<s> One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
<s> Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, ups and downs.
<s> Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know that you will.
<s> What's your drink, Dude?
<s> I thought you might know, man.
<s> Does the Pope shit in the woods?
<s> Jeffrey Lebowski.
<s> Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.
<s> Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you.  You will receive no bill.  He's a good man, and thorough.
<s> Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Huh?  He's fucking loaded.
<s> Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is that yoga?
<s> Hey Walter--
<s> You mean--beyond pacifism?
<s> Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
<s> Huh?
<s> Huh?
<s> My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude. The whites.
<s> What the fuck is going on there?
<s> Huh?
<s> Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
<s> What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself--
<s> That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--
<s> Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of rest.  Means I don't work, I don't drive a car, I don't fucking ride in a car, I don't handle money, I don't turn on the oven, and I sure as shit don't fucking roll!
<s> For Christ's sake, Dude.
<s> And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty undies.  My fucking whites--Say, where is  the car?
<s> Whose toe was it, Walter?
<s> Huh?
<s> Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude.
<s> Yeah, go figure.  Well we'll go out there after the, uh, the.
<s> Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options.  Wait in the car, Donny.
<s> Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
<s> I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
<s> I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
<s> What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
<s> Yeah.
<s> Wha. . . Donny--
<s> A hundred and eighty dollars?!
<s> Walter--
<s> You're a fuck, Walter!
<s> Okay, vee proceed.  But only if there is no funny stuff.
<s> Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
<s> Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the--
<s> My wife is not the issue here. I hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame.  I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway. I can't solve your problems, sir, only you can.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Minutes.
<s> What?
<s> If that's true, then why'd you save me?
<s> I don't understand.
<s> I'll show you.
<s> Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
<s> You don't have a choice.  You're just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can.
<s> I don't know about this, man --
<s> Human?
<s> Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?
<s> He was here.  Watching us.
<s> Two things.  One, I was on to you the moment they turned you.  And two --  I switched that dud of yours back with the real one.
<s> Getting your attention, Paco.
<s> Ain't nobody here but you and me, chicken wing.  I'd say this is as good a time as any to settle up.
<s> They've made contact with the Reapers.
<s> Scud.
<s> After last night?  Dude, I'm a lover, not a fighter.
<s> You little shit.  When did they get to you?
<s> I don't buy it.
<s> Maybe I don't see it that way.
<s> Pass.
<s> Watch me.
<s> You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
<s> Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
<s> Preventive medicine.
<s> It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!
<s> He will.
<s> How can you tell?
<s> Nothing that won't heal by dawn.
<s> Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute.
<s> Some. It's been slow --
<s> You make it sound like I'm already dead.
<s> I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
<s> I'm not leaving without you.
<s> It's the only way. You know that. We'll never get out of here alive if you don't.
<s> For them. But for me --
<s> You're a week early.
<s> I don't believe that.
<s> Perhaps.
<s> We weren't sure we could trust you.
<s> I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in.
<s> Closer. Lift the lid and look-- it hurts.
<s> Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers.
<s> No. What's it doing here in the middle of the foundation?
<s> --doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch--
<s> You said the name "James."
<s> --no, you're not. You love me too much. You don't want to see them kill me.
<s> You have to go.
<s> I want amphetamines.
<s> --yeah, the goddamn stoners! Who you think stole the stuff!?
<s> Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
<s> --there's something <u>here</u>, Nick--
<s> Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.
<s> Just let me get my coat off--I had eight cups of coffee, I'm wired for sound here.
<s> It's not about witches, goddamnit!
<s> That's what Josh and Mike said.
<s> So where the hell am I going to sleep?
<s> Yeah?
<s> My room, asleep, last I checked.
<s> --I don't trust anybody, not even me, anymore--
<s> --turn the camera off--
<s> It's a <u>serious</u> sociological study.
<s> All I need--
<s> --oh, Jesus--
<s> Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
<s> --shit!!!
<s> Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
<s> I thought the movie was bitchin'.
<s> Okay.
<s> Get some more beer.
<s> Go to the store. When you get back, I'll try to make sense of it for you.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Anna--
<s> I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--
<s> It won't?
<s> I just gotta see a guy.
<s> Door's locked. Nothing there.
<s> ...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Thanks.
<s> About ten years.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
<s> ...Hell.
<s> Back where?
<s> Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
<s> Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
<s> I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine--
<s> It's not strictly legal.
<s> What do you think?
<s> Of course.
<s> Nah, I trust ya.
<s> Right.
<s> Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night.
<s> You shouldn't have taken the money...
<s> Tuesday.
<s> No. I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
<s> Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
<s> Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
<s> It must be great.
<s> Okay.
<s> Only you. and the photo lab.
<s> You want to see him too, right?
<s> Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  . Hey, pretty, pretty.
<s> Jeffrey nothing.
<s> I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
<s> Then you got undressed.
<s> Nothing. Are you alright?
<s> See my nipples?
<s> Don't say that.
<s> Yeah. hurry up though.
<s> Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
<s> Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me, huh?
<s> I'm doing it.
<s> No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
<s> Do you love me?
<s> Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
<s> Oh God, Jeffrey. is that you? Oh God.
<s> Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
<s> A ride?. Hell, that's a good idea. okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
<s> FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
<s> Still, it must be kinda rough.
<s> There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
<s> Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
<s> Alright.
<s> Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
<s> Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
<s> Why not?
<s> I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
<s> I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
<s> That doesn't bother you, does it?
<s> No.
<s> Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
<s> Where to?
<s> Go ahead!
<s> Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
<s> Hey Jeff.
<s> It's good to see you, Dad.
<s> Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
<s> Alright.
<s> I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean. no offense.
<s> He what?
<s> That's impossible.  We can't be up and running.  Who's distributing?
<s> A toast!  To Mister George Jung.  Mr. I 95, north and south.  My brother-in-law. Happy birthday!
<s> Five-thousand per kilo.
<s> This is a one time thing, Gusto.  One and I'm out.  Give me a good price for old time's sake.  What do you think?
<s> Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
<s> Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years.  I'll serve two.
<s> What?  You're not going to wait for me?
<s> Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
<s> Something about vengance being best served cold.
<s> No.
<s> We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
<s> It's your grass.
<s> Here's the best part.  We can charge five-hundred a pound.
<s> It's great and everything, but what am I going to do with all this?
<s> You have your intrigues.  I have mine. This is a happy day for me, George. Nine months from today, I will be in Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine months, I am free.  How much time do you have?
<s> I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
<s> And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
<s> Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything is fine down here.  Everything is all set up.
<s> I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on parole.  I can't leave the state.
<s> Yes.  Look around you.  The sun.  The water.  The women.  It's better than Danbury, no?  Come on.  I have some friends I would like you to meet.
<s> But to the victor belong the spoils.
<s> Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.
<s> You fucked me, Diego.
<s> You went behind my back and you cut me out.
<s> Take your boots off.  You're tan.
<s> Mom.
<s> I'm just happy that George has found someone he cares for.
<s> Look at this credenza.  If you don't mind me asking, how much is something like that?  It's got to cost a fortune.
<s> Don't bullshit me, George.  I don't see you very much, I don't want to waste the time.
<s> Tuna.
<s> Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
<s> She did that before.
<s> Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.
<s> That's right.  Always spying, always judging.  Everyone's laughing at you, you fucking pussy.  You let Diego fuck you in the ass.  Maybe you are a fucking faggot.  You must be fucking Diego because you're not fucking me.
<s> You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
<s> Kristina's fine.
<s> Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
<s> Better than you.
<s> Yeah.
<s> No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
<s> California.
<s> I know, Dad.  I know...
<s> I know, Dad.  I love you too.
<s> Shit, yeah.  Do you know how much money I could make if I had this stuff back east?
<s> So, we need to get to the source.
<s> They're not paying me anything. They've already warned you twice; this is the last warning. Decide.
<s> Sure. By shooting at me.
<s> I don't even know your name yet ...
<s> C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
<s> It's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew begins at midnight.
<s> Good evening, sir.
<s> Of course I am.
<s> So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
<s> You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
<s> Thanks, Mister D.
<s> I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
<s> Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
<s> We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
<s> We found a bottle of Dristan nasal spray on the nightstand.  It was filled with water and cocaine.  Mr. Marsh had a head cold at the time of his death.  I believe he wasn't aware that he was ingesting cocaine.
<s> Like cats and dogs.
<s> Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.
<s> Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
<s> The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago.
<s> Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the defendant for many months.  I feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson.
<s> No.  I haven't done it in years.
<s> I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
<s> No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
<s> What did she say?
<s> No.  No, I don't.
<s> Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a year.
<s> Chinese peony root.
<s> Yes -- he did.
<s> He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
<s> There was an inquiry.  It was his word against mine.  They believed him.  I was fired.
<s> Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was thirty years older than her. Where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that -- to have the kind of sex they had.
<s> So, isn't it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love?  That what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didn't stop it was going to kill him.  That if she did leave his heart couldn't take it.
<s> It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
<s> You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there?
<s> No!  Why would I want to kill him?
<s> You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.
<s> You still haven't answered my question.
<s> No pain, no gain?
<s> We're not animals.
<s> I thought the subject was sex?
<s> Not true.  Shall I tell you what you were thinking?  You were wondering if I was wearing anything under my skirt.
<s> Hi.  It's Frank.
<s> No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
<s> To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
<s> You're too weak, Frank.  When you want something you have to do what- ever it takes to get it.  If something gets in your way you remove it.
<s> You're a monster.
<s> We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you to go with her.
<s> Why?
<s> I gotta go.  I'll call you later.
<s> That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.
<s> Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on to another line of questioning.
<s> How often do you use cocaine?
<s> We're supposed to go to the lake.
<s> Yes.
<s> Maybe it would be a good idea if you just took Michael.
<s> You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
<s> Sorry.
<s> We have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.
<s> We were here two Christmases ago.
<s> SO!
<s> Why are there two deeds here?
<s> I know. I don't understand it either.
<s> Mom's orders.
<s> Come here a minute.
<s> That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
<s> Well, what am I supposed to think?
<s> No. We're going to lock this up and --
<s> Hi. I made some brown betty. I sent Floyd off to town with the boy. I said -  "Floyd, I'm going to visit my girlfriend and spend the afternoon and that's all there is to it. He said who's going to make lunch? I said I'm taking a sick day. Eat at the dinner." Isn't that hilarious?  He didn't dare raise an eyebrow -- I don't even want to tell you how late he was out last night with those good for nothings from the Sandford ranch. I am so sorry, honey, I let two days pass before I came by, but with the boy home the time just escapes me. Have you heard from Richard? How's the fair? God, it's hot.
<s> You want me to call the doctor?
<s> Hmm-mmm.
<s> Maybe it's because I live here.
<s> Long.  You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
<s> Would you do me a favor and go to the truck? Inside that leather bag with the pockets is a package of lens cleaners. Would you grab me one?
<s> I found this Chicago station before. Wait a minute...  Here it is.
<s> What?
<s> Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.
<s> Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
<s> No.
<s> No. But I love them just the same.
<s> Yes! Hi.
<s> The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
<s> I sat outside and had coffee.
<s> Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out.
<s> Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
<s> I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
<s> Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
<s> I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
<s> You people really don't like dogs.
<s> Yeah?
<s> The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.
<s> Damn.  It's so...fresh.
<s> Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.
<s> Whatever, let's just get the hellout of here.
<s> Damned if I know.
<s> Big Bad Eddie Mack?  Got shit for brains and that's a fack.  Hey-heh...
<s> Go on.  It won't kill you.
<s> That's your dream, Homes.  Not mine.  I don't want to leave this street.  Ever. The status quo is totally cool with me.
<s> Since we was just grasshoppers...
<s> No brother.  I wouldn'ta.  I never done a man - any man.  Let alone a brother like that.  Course, as you can see, no good deed goes unfucked.  Now the question is, if the good get fucked, what we got saved up for the bad?  You about to find out.
<s> I have to finish this for class.
<s> I don't want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
<s> You said the vision, the images.  They're just that.  Just pictures.  They can't hurt you.  That's what you always said.
<s> All the more reason I should be here.
<s> But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
<s> But how do you know?  Maybe he just wanted to see us?  And now he's gone again.  And you've all killed my father for the second time.
<s> I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
<s> Anytime.  Be seeing you.
<s> That place is already bad luck.
<s> My momma says every house is two houses. Every street, two streets.  There's a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one.  The city of the dead.
<s> Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
<s> I'm sure I can make your mother like me. But then do I gotta worry 'bout your father?
<s> Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the boys.
<s> Bill!  Bill?!
<s> I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out.  I was trying to protect you.
<s> You was just doing your job.
<s> Fuckin' comedian.  See you tomorrow.
<s> Look, you guys want to play college radio, high school reunions, and some fool's club once a week for the rest of your lives, that's cool.  But I think we can do better.
<s> Should I?
<s> What we have to do is call the police.
<s> Know what?
<s> All right!  Where's the key?
<s> Where's what?
<s> Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.
<s> What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one of the good towels.
<s> Why?  'Cause you know him?
<s> What are you going to do with it?
<s> Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
<s> Caesar, what are we going to do?
<s> Caesar, maybe we should run --
<s> No.
<s> You don't, you can't believe that ...
<s> Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
<s> Just hurry.
<s> Don't tell him --
<s> Not until he has the money!
<s> Let us go and we'll make a deal.
<s> You betrayed me!
<s> Where's the fucking money?
<s> No.  Rajeev's in India.
<s> Five.
<s> I should be going.
<s> Hey, Mickey.
<s> Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.
<s> Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
<s> Good guess.
<s> Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
<s> Truck.  Of course.
<s> I don't, really.  I was referred to him.
<s> No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
<s> Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying kind.
<s> Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now.
<s> Why?
<s> What?
<s> The redistribution of wealth?
<s> What the fuck was it?
<s> For what?
<s> He hung it up.
<s> In his office.  I saw it this morning.
<s> It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
<s> Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
<s> Yeah, twice.
<s> Trust me, Violet.
<s> Because of what you are going to tell him.  You have to make it as real as you can.  The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan.
<s> Thank you.
<s> What happened?
<s> It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
<s> I'm still here.
<s> No.
<s> Pop, this is important to me.  It's a simple question.  if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it.
<s> Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They were in a car accident.
<s> Sure you're going to be okay?  I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands.
<s> I don't know what we're talking about.
<s> I'm not asking.
<s> What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
<s> <u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.
<s> ...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
<s> ...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights...  ...pills, right?  Treadstone had those pills...
<s> ...they won't let you go...
<s> They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on, do you?
<s> We have to go home, Jason.
<s> I have a passport.  I've got...  Actually, it's a little complicated.
<s> One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
<s> That'd be great.
<s> -- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer, I mean give me a fucking break with this, this is -- 
<s> I won't hurt you.
<s> What?  Like amnesia?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
<s> Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
<s> ...omigod, no...
<s> I didn't know this would happen.
<s> I don't know. 
<s> xxxxxx
<s> xxxxxx
<s> I can't protect you anymore.
<s> Not really.
<s> I said, someone came last night --  Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
<s> So get the hell out of here.
<s> -- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
<s> -- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- Mr. Thomas.  I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this!
<s> -- I'm on it --
<s> -- he accessed the account --
<s> <u>Where am I</u>?
<s> How did I get here?
<s> I don't know.
<s> I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here.
<s> I fixed it myself.
<s> What have you done to my flat?
<s> ...elephoned sir.
<s> Machines don't fix themselves.
<s> Mumble ... Tuttle ...
<s> Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
<s> Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
<s> Jack!
<s> You remember Alison?
<s> Er, I knew you looked different.
<s> I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
<s> Am I?
<s> B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
<s> No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
<s> Well, could you stay away from me until this thing blows over.
<s> Oh.
<s> Really.
<s> Every day?
<s> It wasn't supposed to happen like this.
<s> "Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... Do you think anyone's hurt?
<s> I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
<s> You haven't switched it on.
<s> I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
<s> No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
<s> I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
<s> Monsieur. Quel numero.
<s> Madam ... CUT to WOMAN turning, half in flirtatious conversation. It is SAM's MOTHER, but miraculously another twenty years younger and ... a parody of SAM's Dream Girl.
<s> It's all right, Terry, it's all right, everything's all right.
<s> Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
<s> What?
<s> The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
<s> No. But I can bypass it with one of these
<s> I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you.
<s> You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
<s> No ...
<s> Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
<s> He flipped out.
<s> Mary, we really have to go.
<s> I was tired. I needed a coffee.
<s> Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
<s> He's going to be all right, right?
<s> You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that.
<s> John, play the Sinatra.
<s> You look so different.
<s> I think it looks good.
<s> He's better, though, right?
<s> I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
<s> How long you been doing this?
<s> Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
<s> I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
<s> Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
<s> Maybe I should come up with you.
<s> Fifteen minutes.
<s> He'll be all right.
<s> No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your soap.
<s> No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
<s> Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
<s> He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.
<s> I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
<s> What's wrong.
<s> What look?
<s> Here's to the greatest job in the world.
<s> Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
<s> How can that be? He was getting better.
<s> No prisoners. Don't worry, Frank, just a little psychological first aid.
<s> I've taken that into consideration.
<s> Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
<s> How's he doing?
<s> As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
<s> Why?
<s> No shit.
<s> I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
<s> It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
<s> Someone's gonna die someday causa that bum, going to have a cardiac and the only medics will be taking care of Mr. Oh.
<s> Faster!
<s> You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You write this?
<s> We're conversing...Oh my, the names of the entire Cabinet has slipped my mind.  What are they?
<s> We sure do.  I don't mean it as a knock either.  Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
<s> Sit on it!  <u>Now</u> look.
<s> I'll put her on.
<s> They booted me out of Washington.
<s> Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
<s> London.  That's a promotion!
<s> I'll see you back at the hotel.
<s> Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
<s> At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
<s> No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.
<s> Why do you say that?
<s> You want to start going over who they could have gotten?  They can't take on people like this for network news.  For God's sake.  What's going on?
<s> Which means I'm at their mercy and who wants that?...I'm not going to tell you where this thought led me... Anyway, well, why not  tell you? -- it's a happy thing.  In the middle of all this I start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you ...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give anything if you were two people so I could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one I'm in I...I don't think I should go any further.  Come on -- I'll walk you to the corner.
<s> Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
<s> Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there.
<s> I'm gonna go look at it again.
<s> Stop it.
<s> Just tell me what's really going on.  I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
<s> Wipe me out?
<s> Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
<s> Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God.  They want to fire me.
<s> Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
<s> They told me they'd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line.
<s> So I quit.
<s> Oh, that's nice...  We'll need some new lines.
<s> Oh, come on -- tell us another.
<s> No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
<s> Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
<s> They fired me.
<s> Okay, sweetie.
<s> Nooo.  This way the rotation stays the same.
<s> Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
<s> I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
<s> Ah, I don't want any credit.  Bobbie and I serve anonymously.
<s> Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
<s> Yes.  Just don't say anything mean for a while.  Thanks.
<s> What?
<s> I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me...I'm sorry...Hey, you called me.
<s> Oh, good.
<s> Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
<s> I'd like to know.  I'll go along.
<s> Don't run off --  like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind.
<s> It's not that it's hard.  I just want you to give me a minute to catch up.
<s> Well, when?
<s> That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.
<s> I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
<s> You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.
<s> You want to come?
<s> Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
<s> I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
<s> I didn't have the guts to ask when I first came up.  I'll get you a great tour.
<s> I'm not knocking it.  It's a great solution.  Not only the storage but you can see everything you have.
<s> He made a cat.
<s> It wasn't easy.
<s> Every word...
<s> I thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night!
<s> Carla -
<s> Walter, I'm sorry...
<s> Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
<s> Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
<s> Hm.
<s> I admit it.
<s> I know.
<s> Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
<s> Right.  Ain't no body of work complete without some... nudes -
<s> Yeah, right outside the door!
<s> Well I was uh, just looking...
<s> Sure!  So I guess that means I'm an artist after all.
<s> I don't have another cat!
<s> Now why shouldn't you, Walter? Things are different now...
<s> You made...a bust... WALTER  Yeah isn't it wonderful?
<s> I'm trying to reach Lieutenant Beldere...
<s> I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!
<s> Yeah I did.
<s> Huh?!!!
<s> Telling you what?
<s> You are?
<s> I got you cold, pal.  Make it easy for yourself, use your head.
<s> Hiya Maxwell.
<s> T-turned on?
<s> If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
<s> Noise Mrs. Swicker?  What noise?
<s> I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.
<s> The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
<s> I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
<s> Let's move out!
<s> Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can I borrow her?
<s> We hate you guys!
<s> Bummer metaphor.
<s> You think?  Split?
<s> My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
<s> Uum... around ten?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Didn't you get my message?
<s> I'm out of here.  Jenny.
<s> I think you've forgotten something.
<s> It was.  I think it's pretty much ready for the --
<s> Yeah.
<s> It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.
<s> Merrick...
<s> What for?
<s> But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
<s> I should have known.
<s> I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.
<s> Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?
<s> Sounds toasty.  We're going Pavilion.
<s> Where?
<s> I forgot.
<s> To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
<s> I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
<s> This is it.
<s> Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
<s> No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
<s> It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.
<s> Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
<s> I was just scared is all.
<s> Nicole...
<s> What's happening?  What do you want?
<s> Really?
<s> You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
<s> I'm just a girl.
<s> Could be.
<s> But --
<s> You want some punch?
<s> Oh, please.
<s> Right!
<s> Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
<s> I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
<s> What?
<s> What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
<s> Switch nostrils?
<s> I know what it is.
<s> Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.
<s> Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
<s> Don't worry.
<s> "I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
<s> Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
<s> When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
<s> Let me.
<s> Aren't we all?
<s> I want to be had.
<s> I want you desperately!
<s> Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
<s> You okay?
<s> I heard already.
<s> Uh oh...  Can I offer you some coffee?
<s> You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.
<s> Beg me!
<s> Shake off the pitch.  Throw what you wanta.
<s> By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
<s> Jesus.
<s> Then go.
<s> Let go of me!
<s> My right.
<s> I know.  I just like to see you get all worked up.
<s> 'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.  The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him-
<s> I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
<s> We'll be praying for you.
<s> Can I give you my testimony?
<s> It's a league record.
<s> League record.  And he hit the Radio Announcer, a Sportswriter, and the Bull Mascot twice--also league records--  Joe, the guy's got some serious shit.
<s> We're eight and sixteen.
<s> Look, guys--I'm a man, I got needs too.  I understand this party-- but...  sex is the one thing you can get further behind in and catch up faster than anything I know.  There's a baseball lesson in there somewhere.  Where's Crash?
<s> He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
<s> It's a damn convention.
<s> This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
<s> I can't believe you're doing this.
<s> I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?!
<s> Liar.
<s> He's lying.
<s> Was I at that dinner?
<s> Watch it, partner, watch it!
<s> ...I will let her in the house for five minutes if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens not to want to leave. Because I don't - I -
<s> Look, Gin, you know I got other people in this. I got partners. But I want you to understand that I am lookin' out for you in this thing.  Okay? You're going to get yours back... and you're gonna get it back first. Okay?
<s> Hey, little Dale Evans.
<s> Hello.
<s> Lester...
<s> Right back.
<s> So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?
<s> They payin'?
<s> You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
<s> I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
<s> To begin, I put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers.
<s> Okay.
<s> Hey, Rich.
<s> Here, let's put a little of this on for you. I know you like this. A little butter, right, not a lot?
<s> Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.
<s> I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do. But you were way out of line, Nick. What're you doin'? Where's your head?
<s> Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license.  And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?
<s> Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.
<s> No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
<s> The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
<s> I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
<s> I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
<s> Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
<s> ...you? Do you remember what I told you?
<s> You never - ?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Sammy.
<s> Well...
<s> Good to meet you.
<s> ...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
<s> Yeah, refill'd be great.
<s> I...
<s> That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.
<s> I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
<s> We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.
<s> Okay. 
<s> Thanks a lot.
<s> Good luck.
<s> I'm not crying. 
<s> The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank.
<s> Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.
<s> It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
<s> And...
<s> At the most, which is impossible for him.
<s> There's nothin' to figure out. I'm home... we're workin' it out.
<s> Let go of me! Let go of me!
<s> No kidding. NO KIDDING!
<s> I'll get your cash. You haven't been straight with me ever since I met you! You never loved me in the first place!  I need eyes in the back of my fuckin' head with you, you fuckin' bitch!
<s> You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here.
<s> I threw it away.
<s> What did Jennifer have?
<s> Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
<s> You fuckin' whore!
<s> I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
<s> But it was just mine.
<s> Good evening, everyone, I'm Paige Novodor.  What should have been a routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam
<s> How many kids do you have?
<s> Mr Rothstein.
<s> Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.
<s> Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.
<s> Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.
<s> I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
<s> You've been very open with us. I mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the Commission.
<s> All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want?
<s> Yeah?
<s> What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
<s> Hey.
<s> I understand.
<s> I can't.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Nicky, I did -
<s> Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
<s> Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
<s> Is that the last one?
<s> Carmine's gone.
<s> But I'm just trying to leave.
<s> I know.
<s> I'll tell him, Remo.
<s> It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
<s> I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
<s> Hm.
<s> No problem.
<s> Okay, Sammy.
<s> I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.
<s> It's all right.
<s> Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
<s> It's what you want?
<s> Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out!
<s> All right. Be careful.
<s> Thank you. Very nice.
<s> Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
<s> Promise?
<s> Okay, then.
<s> Uh, talk to you later.  Bye. 
<s> That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -
<s> Listen...
<s> They check in alone?
<s> I think that's it.
<s> God, I'm telling you, they're out!
<s> Get up.
<s> What's takin' so long over there?
<s> What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
<s> Stacy. 
<s> Pleasure.
<s> You should pay as fast as you collect, you know.
<s> They'll do it.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Dominick said they're in the motel?
<s> Shh.  Hide her car in the back!
<s> Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!
<s> Get her the fuck out of here. Get her out of here.
<s> Fuck you, you motherfuck!
<s> Yeah.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Then do it the way you want.
<s> Having a good time?
<s> I don't know about you, guys, but I'm getting a little buzz off this.
<s> Be verwy, verwy, quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.
<s> That's a good one, dude. He says we're going to kill you whether you tell us where the disc is or not.
<s> In women?
<s> I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
<s> I wonder..
<s> Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
<s> You're very special. Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors, but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one..
<s> Stop. We are not having a "duality" conversation. "Ooh, he has a secret side.  Ooh, she has a dark side." Please.  Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me?  You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying "I have an inner strength" or "Deep down, I'm really ambitious." "One day I'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night." If you are something, then you better be out there doing something.  You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. We are not having a "duality" conversation.
<s> I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
<s> Absolutely.
<s> Do you have any idea how much superheroes get paid?  Zilcho. Urban vigilantes with secret identities operating outside the law. Not exactly the stuff of a W-2 form.  If it wasn't for merchandising and corruption and these diabolical "missions"...There is no such thing as heroes and villains, anymore, Selina.  There are only winners and losers. You lost. We won.
<s> I don't want to hurt you, Catwoman. Yet.  After tomorrow, you can do anything you want, but please, just stay out of sight for the next 24 hours. I won't stand by and watch my leader get all emotional over an animal like you. I warn you, don't tempt Captain God when he is angry. Let is complete our mission in peace.
<s> You're not strong. You're scared..scared that someone like me will see right through you. Whatever the Cult of Good was, it's not anymore... You don't have to listen to me, just listen to you..
<s> "Pre-bicentennial babe?"
<s> What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just, I like her a lot.
<s> I actually got some memory back last night.
<s> Yes, you shouted the words "Captain God" at me for no reason...
<s> What?
<s> About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?
<s> I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
<s> Uh-huh..
<s> Okay. Let's get serious. Of course I know the Cult of Good is not good. Ever since I saw what they did in Atlanta, it has been my mission to expose them. I've followed them to Oasisburg and soon will have enough hard evidence to bring them to real justice. That computer disc could be the final piece to the puzzle. This isn't just a story, Selina--another damn Pulitzer--this is my life.
<s> But I'm blind.
<s> Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.
<s> I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
<s> Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
<s> I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
<s> Taking messages.
<s> You could've made me lose my call.
<s> Can you make him stop!
<s> I'm the one they'd be looking for.
<s> Make a "U" and go back.
<s> It's rolled up in the tube on the floor back there.
<s> I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
<s> Allow me.
<s> You don't understand.
<s> They gave me pills to make me sleep.  They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance --
<s> I have no idea.  They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  The shutters up here are nailed shut.
<s> One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
<s> I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
<s> Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
<s> What about the others?
<s> Sometimes I paint.
<s> I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.
<s> No.
<s> The one in Brentwood.
<s> The City National on San Vincente.
<s> I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
<s> Why can't it be her?
<s> I'm sorry.  You've thought this out better than I ever could.  I'm ready now.
<s> They put their hands all over me.
<s> Jack Oberfeld in person.  Did you kill him?
<s> I thought it was inspired.
<s> You knew about me.
<s> You won't shoot me.  That's not your style.
<s> I don't hear him moving around anymore.
<s> A typical fuck-up.
<s> Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
<s> You could've hit me.
<s> Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
<s> Let me talk to him.  Hold the phone to my ear -- but don't nudge me.
<s> Ask them.
<s> I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.
<s> That's not good enough.
<s> He let the fucking cop out -- but he won't --
<s> Took preparation.
<s> Toss them -- one at a time.  I don't want to lose count.
<s> I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
<s> It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
<s> Got a phone in that van?
<s> I wish it had never been invented.
<s> We don't see you.
<s> I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
<s> Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
<s> And make ourselves a hell of a target.
<s> Are you busting my chops or what?
<s> Where is this canyon house where you're supposed to hook up?
<s> Is that good or bad?
<s> She's not a girl, Col --
<s> See what, Dil?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
<s> C'mon, babe! You know what I like... Easy!
<s> Fucking mad!
<s> Take your fucking goldfish, too!
<s> Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
<s> He wants to know do I mean that.
<s> She's not that either.
<s> Consider it how you like. Just get that bloody tart out of here.
<s> Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
<s> No.
<s> The accent, I suppose.
<s> You say that like a gentleman.
<s> I am.
<s> Give it over, Dil --
<s> Must be.
<s> So they do know.
<s> Are you pretending yet?
<s> Why shouldn't I be jealous?
<s> Yes.
<s> More than that.
<s> A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
<s> No.
<s> I promise.
<s> Only in times of extreme stress.
<s> You knew my Jody?
<s> I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died.
<s> I like you, Dil --
<s> Yeah.
<s> Fergus.
<s> I asked you a question, honey -- were you there too --
<s> Please, Dil --
<s> Absolutely. The younger the better. Doesn't come your way much, I suppose.
<s> A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
<s> You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're you keeping?
<s> Do you want some food?
<s> Someone's got to do it.
<s> Yes.
<s> Was I?
<s> He described me down to a T. Knows what Jude looks like.
<s> Who'd you think it was?
<s> Should blow you away, you know that?
<s> Definitely unusual.
<s> My pleasure.
<s> And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose.
<s> I'm talking about your people, not you.
<s> What?
<s> Don't I know it.
<s> You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
<s> How different?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
<s> Tell me, Jody
<s> Shut the fuck up, Jude.
<s> No, we are.
<s> Where are you, ol' buddy?
<s> I think that's what you ordered.
<s> Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
<s> Well -- come on.
<s> Adam --
<s> Why?
<s> I mean, it's there, Reggie. If only we could see it. We're looking at it right now.
<s> The tooth powder. Wait a minute -- could you recognize heroin just by tasting it?
<s> Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.
<s> It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on!
<s> Look.
<s> You lied to me so many times --
<s> And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.
<s> We? You mean you're --?
<s> May I have a sandwich, please?
<s> Thanks very much.
<s> But --
<s> Because they're still here.
<s> What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
<s> That's not Carson Dyle.
<s> Me? Why me?
<s> Agents.
<s> The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
<s> Next, please.
<s> Brian.
<s> My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps.
<s> Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
<s> Before we start on that, do you mind handing over the stamps?
<s> You're out, Dyle -- right now!
<s> That's the idea.
<s> Me?
<s> But he'd have to. If he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. That's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.
<s> No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
<s> I met a man with sharp nails.
<s> Which one are you?
<s> Come here.
<s> Okay.
<s> You did.
<s> Tuesday.
<s> Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
<s> A) It's always the person you don't suspect; B) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
<s> Shut the door!
<s> How often do you go through this little ritual?
<s> No -- he's not the same. Alexander Dyle was interested in clearing up his brother's death. Adam Canfield is a crook. And with all the advantages you've got -- brains, charm, education, a handsome face --
<s> You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Félix -- are they for sale now?
<s> No. The police have kindly provided us with a list.
<s> Not unless we're blind.
<s> Stop it!
<s> Swiss.
<s> I know.  I'm sorry.
<s> Yes. Your appointment has been changed.  One key to your apartment -- one comb -- one fountain pen --  one toothbrush -- one tin of tooth powder  -- that is all.
<s> No, Jean-Louis.
<s> I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Félix lives?
<s> I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
<s> Yes.
<s> No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
<s> Now you're angry.
<s> Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
<s> I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
<s> Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
<s> Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
<s> No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti!
<s> Yes, you were -- you called it nonsense. Being murdered in cold blood isn't nonsense. Wait until it happens to you sometime.
<s> Where?
<s> Be careful, Peter.
<s> I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
<s> Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
<s> That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
<s> The man you had the fight with.
<s> Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
<s> What's the matter, chérie?
<s> What?
<s> He took care of Charlie for us.
<s> I just wanted to check that you were okay?
<s> So?
<s> I thought you'd be pleased.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
<s> I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.
<s> You know where I can find her?
<s> I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
<s> Yeah. You should check downstairs.
<s> Can you just follow me? The back is full?
<s> Really?
<s> Why?
<s> You eventually have to talk to him.
<s> You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
<s> But you can't do any of it. So it sucks. I always have to 'set an example'.
<s> He says he loves me.
<s> Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
<s> Twenty eight years ago.
<s> No.
<s> I'll think about it.
<s> I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.
<s> What?
<s> You're not telling me something.
<s> Just thinking about something.
<s> I'm not leaving it here.
<s> Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.
<s> You're being unfair.
<s> EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY.
<s> Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'. 
<s> Except for the fact that I need cash.
<s> ...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.
<s> Hang on.  Hang on.
<s> For cryin' out loud.
<s> I need your help.
<s> I got fifty bucks.  I'll get more.

<s> Oh, shit.
<s> God, man!
<s> ...Pete!  Come on.
<s>  Oh...
<s>  ...shit!
<s> 
<s> 
<s> 
<s> Then stay...
<s> What?
<s> Worth a try.
<s> And he swore, he swore once I got a degree...
<s> So you took his...
<s> We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar.  I was drivin'.
<s> Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
<s> ...or my conscience.
<s> You all right?
<s> 
<s> 
<s> 
<s>  That's why I didn't give it...
<s> Okay.
<s> ...our ass!
<s> Whoo!
<s> 
<s>  
<s> 
<s> We got-...
<s> 
<s> 
<s> ...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
<s> I think so too.
<s> What about all that "no need to get in the man's...
<s> Oh, my God.
<s> Three seconds.  One...
<s> And it won't be pleasant. 
<s> 
<s> I ain't got time to argue with you today, Andy.  But I can tell you this.  Takin' your truck pissed you off?
<s> 
<s>  ...Mason.  I can barely hear you.
<s> ...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
<s> ...including the permanently extreme.
<s> ...-tor Long.
<s> I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
<s> But you have no choice but to follow orders.

<s> 
<s> Story of my life.  Well, one thing you won't lose is that friend of yours back there, I'll tell you that.
<s> His I know.  Yours I don't have a clue.  But if it wasn't for you, I think he'd have drifted right on through this town.

<s> 
<s> BLACK BACKGROUND.
<s> Jake, for Christ's sake.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Do you know him?
<s> Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?
<s> It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
<s> Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
<s> Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can.
<s> She's fine.
<s> That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
<s> Do you remember the figures we discussed?
<s> At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
<s> I don't know...
<s> Okay, you got yourself a boat.
<s> Sue the shit out of 'em.
<s> Summer colds are the worst.
<s> Since when?
<s> No.
<s> Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
<s> C'mon I'll show you.
<s> Too late for what?
<s> Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
<s> Looks like you went quite a distance.
<s> I'll stop by.
<s> ...Just a minute...
<s> A check?
<s> Why?
<s> No, not for that one.
<s> Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
<s> For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.
<s> No, I think I'd remember.
<s> What? What is it?
<s> Yeah.
<s> You can't always tell what's going on there.
<s> Your eye.
<s> Just... I have to.
<s> It has to do with my father.
<s> The police?
<s> Aren't you coming back with me?
<s> What the hell is this all about?
<s> Where can we go?
<s> Okay...
<s> He didn't wear bifocals.
<s> I'm all right.
<s> I think I got something.
<s> You'll find one of those people.
<s> A Miss Sessions calling.
<s> Of course.
<s> We don't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy. I know you'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us.
<s> Maybe he takes it very seriously.
<s> Well, no.
<s> Never.
<s> When it comes? What'd you tell him?
<s> Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.
<s> So how are you, Morty?
<s> Drowned, too.
<s> It's not completely dry.
<s> Yeah.  Do you have any references?
<s> Since lunch.
<s> I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
<s> Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.
<s> Along with Mr. Mulwray.
<s> Look, you tell me to take pictures, I take pictures.
<s> No, you have a press agent do it.
<s> Well, you never know, do you?
<s> ...and turn into a piece of charcoal!!
<s> So I can have these? 
<s> Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!! 
<s> OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
<s> What you say is wonderful! But sad...
<s> But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
<s> Whatever you do, love it like you loved that projection booth of the Paradiso when you were little... 
<s> Father Adelfio, I have a very serious doubt that is torturing my soul. And you've got to help me, because I've lost all peace of mind...
<s> We'll talk about that later.
<s> They're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome!
<s> So what's that got to do with it?
<s> That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.
<s> Thais.
<s> I didn't see that.
<s> I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
<s> These'll be kept.  I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.  I will also provide them -
<s> We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
<s> You don't really think so?
<s> And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
<s> I'm going back there.
<s> Certainly not.
<s> Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
<s> I wanted him to have fun - and with me along -
<s> 
<s> Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it.
<s> Ask them to sit down.
<s> Of course.
<s> Charles!  Your - your breaking this man's neck -  would scarcely explain this note -  Serious consequences for Mr. Kane -  for myself, and for my son.  What does this note mean, Miss -
<s> I'd rather Mr. Kane withdrew without having to get the story published. Not that I care about him.  But I'd be better off that way -  - and so would you, Mrs. Kane.
<s> Brad, I'm -  I'm not an old woman yet -
<s> He's paying for it, Emily.  Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically -  - socially, everywhere, I guess. I don't know about the papers, but -
<s> Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you.  I'll be in it, too, won't I?  And Junior?
<s> Charlie, please don't -
<s> I'm sorry.  They live here, too?
<s> I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
<s> I work at Seligman's.
<s> Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
<s> Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
<s> Well, I -
<s> That's when you've got to fight them. That's when you've got to make them. That's -
<s> Half past eleven.
<s> You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
<s> I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
<s> You're my wife, Susan, and -
<s> I'm going to be elected governor. And the first thing I'm going to do -
<s> I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!
<s> It's the only vein I know.  I tell the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts -
<s> Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane your opinion of her talents. You're supposed to train her voice. Nothing more.
<s> Can you prove it isn't?
<s> They're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket. They're -
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Marie has been packing since morning, Mr. Kane.
<s> Yes, sir. 
<s> People are going to know who's responsible.  And they're going to get the news - the true news - quickly and simply and entertainingly.  And no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news.
<s> Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
<s> Yes?
<s> Good.
<s> Charlie -
<s> Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
<s> You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
<s> Look out that window.
<s> That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you -  Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?
<s> The personal note is all there is to it.  It's all there ever is to it.  It's all there every is to anything!  Stupidity in our government, complacency and self-satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you can't fight those things impersonally. They're not impersonal crimes against people.  They're being done by actual persons - with actual names and positions and - the right of the American people to own their own country is not an academic issue, Brad, that you debate - and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers.
<s> I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie.  We'll let the salary stay where it is.
<s> It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.
<s> Rogers isn't even pretending.  He isn't just scared anymore.  He's sick.  Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.
<s> That's what you think, is it, Jim?
<s> The Bank's decision in all matters concerning his education, his place of residence and similar subjects will be final. 
<s> Right here, Mrs. Kane.
<s> Turn that thing off, will you?  It's driving me nuts!  What's Rosebud?
<s> But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
<s> Good!
<s> Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
<s> I had a toothache.
<s> Rosebud?
<s> Are you serious?
<s> It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.
<s> It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
<s> This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that?
<s> You've made a wise choice. Keep up the good work.
<s> The ones in this town, yes! You encourage their growth, their habit. You're the source in this area, and we're going to shut you down for good! For good, cancer-merchant!
<s> Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
<s> It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
<s> Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
<s> So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
<s> We could introduce them. They might hit it off.
<s> You have a better suggestion?
<s> Who doesn't?
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Yes.
<s> "Space Alien Revealed as Head of Time Warner; Reports Stock Increase."  They print any kind of shit in these papers.
<s> Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
<s> Lenin's Tomb.
<s> So I'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia?
<s> Peptic ulcer.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
<s> I thought Redding had like three balls!
<s> Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later.
<s> Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
<s> No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
<s> What about Veronica?
<s> Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
<s> Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
<s> He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
<s> I told him that and he yelled at me.
<s> He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
<s> What kind of show?
<s> Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
<s> Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
<s> Can you believe this?!
<s> At least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here.
<s> I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
<s> "It's not like we're gonna sell out."
<s> She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.
<s> Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
<s> True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
<s> Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend.
<s> That's embarrassing?
<s> No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.
<s> Balls resting on his lips.
<s> Nobody's there. It's four o'clock on a Saturday. How many people ever come to the store at four on a Saturday?
<s> So the casket fell over! Big deal!
<s> It's going to have to do for now, considering that it's my car that's up for request.  Can I help you?
<s> If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice.  Agreed?
<s> I'll read the book.
<s> I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
<s> Could be.
<s> My life is in the shitter right about now, so if you don't mind, I'd like to stew a bit.
<s> Leave me alone.
<s> You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
<s> The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings.  How's your neck?
<s> Helluva day.
<s> Yes.
<s> Jesus Christ, what next?
<s> I didn't strain. I sighed.
<s> See? You're ashamed. You know you're out of shape. Take my card.  I can help you tone that body up in no time. Get you on an aerobics and free-weights program.
<s> How do you know that?
<s> While you two were dating in high school. We're talking four, five years ago, back when I drove a Trans- Am.
<s> You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
<s> I'm trying.
<s> No, he got hit by a bus.
<s> Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
<s> No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter.
<s> Somebody jammed the locks with gum.
<s> Hunhh? Nothing.
<s> Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
<s> I touched a nerve.
<s> These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
<s> That's because I never had sex with him!
<s> Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
<s> Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
<s> Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
<s> I don't want to go back with her...
<s> I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
<s> You're gonna be at John K's party?
<s> I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
<s> Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
<s> That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
<s> C'mon, man--it's perfect weather for a monster, full-fledged gutrush!
<s> They're about two hundred yards from the top of the tower, right where that ledge comes out, Gabe.
<s> Where's the radio?
<s> A bad climb, no, just another challenge.  What's life without 'em, right, Agent Travers.
<s> I need my bolt gun and an ice axe.
<s> When we get this group down, I'm gone.
<s> You keep it.  Get up there if you can, and if you get a chance, do me a favor and kill him.
<s> One...
<s> I'm here!  Sarah, I'm here!  I'm here--I've got you!
<s> Help me!  I don't want to die!
<s> Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.
<s> Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
<s> It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.
<s> He can handle it.
<s> You got to go back now!
<s> You attacked me.
<s> Breathtaking.
<s> No, not really.  Throw down a rope.
<s> For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright.  When I secure the line, come on up.
<s> We gotta get out and fire a flare.  It's the only chance!
<s> Never
<s> That's exactly what I want you to do.
<s> Oh, good. For a minute I thought you'd lost your mind.
<s> I burned it.
<s> We're not animals, but don't force us to be.  Walk over.
<s> Sue me.
<s> I'm touched.  Kristel, check the chopper, let's go.
<s> Tucker and Walker.
<s> Now I have jurisdiction!  I said get your weapons.
<s> I haven't even got on it yet.  Let's go, time to fetch.
<s> Kill him when he gets down.
<s> We're down to a few hours before the whole world shows up here.  Where's the next one?
<s> Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move.
<s> I've been cured.
<s> ... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.
<s> Cut the shit, sonny, and get out of here before you get yourself in some very serious trouble. He rocks the giant phallus which has a special weight swinging inside causing it to swing up and down an eccentric motion.
<s> Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
<s> A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir. I think it should be clear by this afterlunch.
<s> To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir? Anything wrong, sir? Deltoid "playfully" grabs Alex's hair.
<s> You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.
<s> Tell me more, Georgie Boy.
<s> I did, sir.
<s> Mmmm, possibly. Yes. But public opinion has a way of changing and you, Alex, if I may call you, Alex?
<s> My name is Frederick. As I was saying, Alex, you can be instrumental in changing the public verdict. Do you understand, Alex? Have I made myself clear?
<s> Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand you're fond of music. I have arranged a little surprise for you.
<s> Aye.
<s> Oh, aye, aye.
<s> Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
<s> Why did you do that, brother? I've never done wrong to you.
<s> Then your toes belong on the other side of it!!!
<s> Blue eyes, yes, sir.
<s> No, sir.
<s> No, sir.
<s> Lice?
<s> What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
<s> Well, that's good. I like to viddy the old films now and again.
<s> Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
<s> What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?
<s> Righty, right. The doctor reads aloud the dialogue printed in the cartoon balloon - a peacock.
<s> Yes.
<s> Good. I'm glad
<s> Let me be sick... I want to get up. Get me something to be sick in... Stop the film... Please stop it... I can't stand it any more. Stop it please... please.
<s> Oh - and what's so stinking about it?
<s> You have, my son.
<s> Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
<s> That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
<s> Prison custody?
<s> Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
<s> Something to sharpen us up, you especially. We have the start.
<s> No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
<s> Are you feeling better?
<s> No, no, no. That's enough. He's perfect. I want his records sent to me. This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.
<s> Travel...and things.
<s> Big case?
<s> How often you go?
<s> Sure thing.
<s> Max...
<s> In my office?
<s> You're kidding me.
<s> 'Fraid so.
<s> It's simple.  What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
<s> Federal?
<s> Wouldn't dream of it.
<s> I don't know...
<s> Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
<s> By worrying about you spending money on foolish things?  So I can watch them wilt?
<s> Where you been the last two hours? Your mother's been calling every ten minutes whining about how you didn't show up.
<s> Oh.  Sorry.
<s> Twenty-four minutes.
<s> It's not that kind of job.
<s> I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs?
<s> No-no, I-I shot him.  The bullets and the fall killed him.
<s> What?
<s> Tonight it is.
<s> Who was he?
<s> Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
<s> I don't understand...
<s> I told you I don't like to talk about it.
<s> Doesn't cover everything.
<s> In case <u>who</u> checks?
<s> Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
<s> No.
<s> Makes two of us.
<s> What's at Union Station?
<s> What happened to you?
<s> Who?
<s> I love her so bad.  She just... wrecks me.  I would die for her.
<s> Mississippi?
<s> No.
<s> You were there, Jerry.  Figure it out.
<s> Can you prove any of this?
<s> I've never read it.  I just -- Every time I see one I buy it.  I don't know why exactly... Wanna hear my favorite part?
<s> So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
<s> If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.
<s> Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Not today.
<s> Where are we going, Jerry?
<s> You go.  Send me a postcard.
<s> Yeah.  I know what it's like.
<s> To Jonas.  I didn't know that at the time.  Didn't know who he was.  But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else.  So I started watching your father.  I wanted to keep him safe.
<s> You saw me standing alone ...
<s> I spent two years here.  This used to bring the med-cart.  Demerol. Phenobarb.  It's Jacob's Ladder.
<s> Top pocket...  Go on.
<s> You think it's a conspiracy?
<s> Now she tells me.
<s> Yes you do, Jerry.  Quite well.
<s> That's great.  Good for you.
<s> Then I can't be hurt anymore.
<s> I'm leaning toward no.
<s> We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She --
<s> Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
<s> As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>?
<s> Yes, that's right.
<s> Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
<s> If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?
<s> Agent Lowry?
<s> This doesn't make sense.
<s> What the hell does that mean?
<s> Your call.  Have a good night.
<s> Go ahead.  We'll be right down.
<s> And Jonas?
<s> He's shown himself.  Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?
<s> What do you suggest?
<s> Ellie?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> It's a hoax.  I knew it!
<s> -- It's extremely unlikely that they had any idea what they were looking at.
<s> Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
<s> So?
<s> You're --
<s> Then disagree but don't stand in my way!
<s> You can't just pull the plug, David.
<s> Meaning...
<s> I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
<s> David --
<s> If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it.  Just one thing:  Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?
<s> What?  Why?
<s> You were right, Ellie.  You were right all along.
<s> Maybe they are.  Maybe this is all part of the package.  The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale.  Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.
<s> What would you have me say, David?
<s> This is how you see the sky?
<s> This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz.  I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.
<s> And a hundred mile airspace.
<s> Is that your official response?
<s> Because I can't.
<s> Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his echo...  Okay, no more stalling.
<s> Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
<s> We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
<s> Now... you go home.
<s> I've had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway.  There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom I've taken so much.
<s> You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
<s> That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
<s> That's my girl.  Done.
<s> How close are you to getting this funding put together?
<s> This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
<s> Jesus --
<s> That is true.  But it's also true that if I really thought we wanted the same things, I'd follow you anywhere... but the truth is I don't think you want the company.  Be honest, El.  There's nowhere you'd rather be than sitting out at some remote corner of the world searching for the answers to the mysteries of the universe.  And call me crazy, but I just can't compete with that... I'm sorry.
<s> Like it or not.
<s> Make that two.
<s> I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
<s> I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
<s> Now you know.
<s> And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
<s> You're willing to die for this.
<s> I won't deny I was ambitious.  When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible.  I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.  You didn't answer my question.
<s> The final countdown.
<s> Thank you.
<s> I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow.
<s> Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
<s> And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please.
<s> Meaning...
<s> I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
<s> How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
<s> Git your shovel and git to work.
<s> I've got this weak heart. Too much drinking, I guess. As soon as they find out about it, they'll probably send me someplace else.
<s> I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
<s> We allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. Was we wrong?
<s> Yeah. Did you have them both at once or --
<s> She's on to him. You shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
<s> How my suppose to handle a dog someone jus' let loose?
<s> Yeah, they sure do make a lot of cold, hard, noise, Captain.
<s> Tramp! Beautiful!
<s> He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
<s> He's eatin' steak and corn with butter and green beans and...
<s> Get away!
<s> Mah baby! We're diggin' and dyin' but our boy Luke is lovin' and flyin'.
<s> A Lucas Jackson.
<s> Well, you know. Small town, not much to do in the evenings. Mostly it was settling up old scores.
<s> But damn if he don't look like a fat old Dragline.
<s> The man wants speed, let's give it to him. Ram it in and break it off. Go hard. Shag it.
<s> You ol' sack of guts. I had a belly like yours, we wouldn't have nothin' to worry about.
<s> I've done enough world-shakin' for a while. You do the rest for me. Send me a postcard about it.
<s> He's the champeen hog-gut of this camp. Hell, I seen him eat ten choc'lat bars and seven cold drinks in fifteen minutes. He kin eat busted bottles and rusty nails, any damn thing. If you'd so kindly oblige as to let me cut off your yankee head, he'd even eat that.
<s> One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
<s> Forty-five.
<s> Dear Boys. Playing it cool. Wish you were here. Love, Cool Hand Luke.
<s> I know he's got a paira kings. He don't have to stick 'em in my ear.
<s> A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney?
<s> Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
<s> Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
<s> Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry' coming up.
<s> Hal has it.
<s> Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
<s> You said, first, he was lying.  How do you know that, Doctor?
<s> I sent it by private courier, he didn't give it to you?  That son of a gun...!
<s> Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
<s> I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
<s> Don't talk to me about courage.  I know death, what it's like to kill. You're not a killer -- you watched Daryll Lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear.  You chocked.  I know something <u>else</u> about you.
<s> I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
<s> Do anything you want to me.  I give myself to you.  Only put the knife down.  Isn't this what you always wanted?  I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved.  I could love you.  You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...
<s> If he's not out, why are they here?
<s> For months... last October.
<s> Nothing.
<s> He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious...
<s> You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style?  That doesn't happen.  These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure...
<s> That little Winona Ryder manner... you're more convincing as Clint Eastwood.
<s> This one, yes.  I was always curious about these twisted little souls, but this is the first one I've felt personally terrified of. He's something new and unheard of. I don't know what he wants.
<s> Look in the crowd.  He liked to hang around and watch the cops at work...
<s> They're not talking to me.  Saks looks right through me.  I ask him for some bodies, for the phones -- he's so encouraging: "you make that <u>your</u> little job."  Condescending bastard.  Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin.  Daryll Lee Cullum?
<s> If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
<s> Well, thanks.
<s> Daryll Lee Cullum?  I don't think so.  If he's escaped we'd have the National Guard, cops'd be crawling through sewers.  You'd have a guard on your front door.
<s> I'll get a locksmith.
<s> Yes.  I have to go...
<s> Go and look for a note.
<s> I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
<s> Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
<s> Yeah.  And you used that. Used <u>me</u>
<s> It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
<s> My promise.
<s> I gotta get something to eat, I haven't eaten all day.
<s> What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
<s> You're damn right I do.
<s> If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.
<s> Give him <u>that</u>pompous son of a bitch.
<s> "Spokes<u>person</u>."
<s> You messed with the evidence.
<s> What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.?
<s> We're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement...
<s> She left you, Nikko.  She's not your responsibility.  She takes very good care of herself.  If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business.  Your business is to snap out of it.
<s> They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air- crash victims. The beds are kept waiting.
<s> Well, yes.  You're getting out of bed tomorrow. They want you to walk.
<s> Outside in the visitors, car park.
<s> I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
<s> Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident.
<s> Vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians.
<s> At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.
<s> Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
<s> Look at all this traffic. I'm not sure I can deal with it.
<s> We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
<s> No.
<s> I can drive.
<s> I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
<s> I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
<s> I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
<s> You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty.
<s> I'd have to see it on.
<s> Thanks so much for planning it, Letty. Jake's really looking forward to it.
<s> Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
<s> Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
<s> I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
<s> We all agree with the doctor, Dear. He thinks it's safer for you to stay here for a while.
<s> But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
<s> We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
<s> I was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask.
<s> A deal's a deal.
<s> There's a spider in my room.
<s> I'm glad.
<s> That must be really difficult.
<s> I wasn't hungry.
<s> Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
<s> Enough with the abracadabra.
<s> Don't be ridiculous.
<s> Do you?
<s> Michael, I...
<s> Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
<s> It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
<s> The restaurant, too?
<s> Michael, take it easy.
<s> Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK.
<s> I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
<s> Sure. Of course.
<s> I'm calling in sick.
<s> Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
<s> Come on, Letty.   It'll get done.
<s> Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
<s> I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
<s> I've met someone else.
<s> He's a patient here.
<s> Simulated sapphires. I bet my daughter would love those, too.
<s> You killed her!
<s> Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
<s> Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.
<s> You'll never get out of the city.
<s> Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.
<s> You're there now?
<s> You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
<s> Oui.
<s> Good.   I'm good.
<s> Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
<s> I will relay the particulars of our conversation to Mr. Maranzano.
<s> No, I'm good, Angelo.
<s> Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
<s> He missed three weeks.
<s> You want me to help you get out of the country?
<s> Half the tapes.
<s> And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?
<s> And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one.
<s> You didn't buy batteries?
<s> What for?
<s> I think he's already figured that out.
<s> You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.
<s> Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
<s> What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?
<s> Good idea.
<s> That's Frankie Zammito.   The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia.
<s> I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.
<s> All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
<s> Has to be.
<s> What'd you get?
<s> I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
<s> I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
<s> -- Did you set it up?
<s> There's just one more thing I need you to do.
<s> Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
<s> Hector, don't interrupt me.
<s> A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.
<s> Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
<s> I see.   A master criminal.
<s> What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
<s> Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
<s> It's my idea.
<s> Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
<s> Get in the car.
<s> Yeah.   It's mine.
<s> It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.
<s> Feel free to correct him if you want.
<s> Oh, you think?
<s> Glenmorangie.
<s> We don't know that for sure.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?
<s> It's for you.
<s> I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
<s> Why were you spying on the Yus?
<s> Then leave her to me.
<s> I do as I please.
<s> That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.
<s> I'll never live as a thief!
<s> Don't invite danger into your father's house.
<s> Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400 years old.
<s> Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
<s> Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
<s> So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
<s> Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
<s> Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
<s> Come and get it if you can.
<s> She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin poison.  It goes straight to the heart.
<s> Jen!
<s> With all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here.  I can't wait any longer.  I was wrong to let you go.  Come back with me.  You'll be happy in the desert.  You'll be free there.
<s> It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
<s> By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
<s> Fine.
<s> Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
<s> She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us.  In any case, it will all be over soon.  You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.
<s> It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
<s> I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
<s> What does it say?
<s> When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots.  Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.  I'll give him an earful!
<s> Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
<s> Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
<s> I call it blood, Detective.  If you want, you can call it graffiti.
<s> I'm buying.
<s> Double homicide.  A year ago. Las Halloween.
<s> I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
<s> You're bleeding, man.  You can't make it.
<s> Out.  Now.  I gotta work.
<s> Fun -- look at that guy...
<s> No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions.
<s> I have to go.
<s> She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
<s> I don't know you.
<s> Victims.  Aren't we all.
<s> That's ancient history.
<s> A whole club of pirates, with pirate names...
<s> You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away.  I don't have any power for you to take.
<s> I took yours from you.  Your little girlfriend?  I took hers, too.  Your meaningless, petty life?  I took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose.  You're no avenger. You're mine.
<s> Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
<s> Your pain ends now.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.  I saw a guitar.  This isn't some rock-n-roller you forgot to pay, is it?  There was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird.  In blood.
<s> Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
<s> From who?
<s> I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.
<s> You did?
<s> Why are you being so dramatic?
<s> Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
<s> What? Another letter from your friend?
<s> You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
<s> Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
<s> Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that.
<s> Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
<s> Don't you believe in love at first sight?
<s> How about tonight?
<s> Yes.
<s> Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
<s> How was your date?
<s> I am lighten. Can we drop this?
<s> Who's Monsieur Philipe?
<s> I thought you said we were going to be friends.
<s> I think that's for the best.
<s> Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
<s> Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite.
<s> I love you.
<s> Schwarz. Jewish?
<s> - none taken -
<s> He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
<s> It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King.
<s> Thanks.  Nice meeting you.
<s> Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
<s> Eww. No. That's gross.
<s> Something awful happened last night.
<s> I don't know.
<s> How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.
<s> Just taking your photo.
<s> I want to go home.
<s> Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
<s> I don't want to kiss you here. I want to kiss you there.
<s> Some other time, Cecile.
<s> Good night Cecile.
<s> You do?
<s> Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
<s> Don't worry about it. I'll stay.
<s> I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.
<s> What?
<s> Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court?
<s> Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
<s> Could you be more desperate to read it?
<s> Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
<s> Have you succeeded in your task?
<s> Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
<s> Morning.
<s> With who?
<s> She shot you down.
<s> You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
<s> Kind of.
<s> Oh yes.
<s> It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
<s> Mock, mock, mock.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
<s> Not that it's any of your business but yes.
<s> I'll do my best.
<s> Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
<s> Do you know when she'll be back?
<s> Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
<s> No. I only let her go with Edward.  It's alright.
<s> How?
<s> You know what I wished, Daddy? I wished I could be a good girl.
<s> Sometimes.
<s> Do you know the people?
<s> What's her name?
<s> Irena.
<s> That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death.  And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
<s> Yes, darling,
<s> I think I should.  3000W?
<s> No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
<s> But wishes don't come true.
<s> Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.
<s> Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
<s> Yes, Amy.
<s> That's a fine-looking ring.
<s> They're given to the living in memory of the dead.  If this is a real one -- I can't be sure -- you can make a wish, and it will come true in the twinkling of an eye.
<s> It's a hard winter. All the animals are bold as brass, coming down into the streets for food. You'll see a lot of deer this winter.
<s> The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
<s> A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
<s> No, not people -- just deer and game, but the people he catches can never be free again. They too must kill and kill, covering themselves with blood.
<s> My little girl said she'd kill you if you came to see me. I can't let you die. We'll have to hide you.
<s> I can't do it! I can't do it!
<s> My daughter died long ago.
<s> My Barbara was killed. I killed her. Yes, it was my fault. Everyone told me not to drive from the theatre. There was a raging wind that night, and snow and ice. All was well until we got to the Sleepy Hollow bridge. Barbara was singing a little song and then ...I don't know how it happened ..when I awakened, they told me the car was overturned, and they wouldn't let me see Barbara. Barbara was dead.
<s> I like to see her happy.
<s> Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
<s> Well, that seems a harmless fancy --
<s> She needed, a companion, so out of her own hunger she created one. In her mind her friend was in the garden. In her mind her friend never leaves her. Right this very minute I'm sure she's upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind.
<s> I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
<s> Can we get some service here?
<s> Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving.
<s> Good. Except for PMS.
<s> It's not just in my head.
<s> Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
<s> No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
<s> Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy.
<s> Your shrink always gives you bad advice. He only hears what you choose to tell him. Mark's an asshole, he cheated, he borrowed money and never paid it back, he's never had a regular job.
<s> Are you kidding? He might as well say, "Can I date rape you?"
<s> I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
<s> Rule one: always wear make-up.
<s> He wasn't wearing a ring. But you don't want to date a cop Frida. They're so blue collar.
<s> I put it down the garbage disposal.
<s> Frida? I was worried to death about you. I've called you for two days. Where have you been?
<s> Did you get rid of Mark?
<s> You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
<s> No.
<s> The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
<s> Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
<s> So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
<s> So what do I do?
<s> You'll get through this. You were fine for over three weeks.
<s> Frida? You okay?
<s> Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.
<s> No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?
<s> Well, whattdaya think?
<s> This really isn't a good time.
<s> On your desk.
<s> On your desk.
<s> Intriguing?
<s> Oh my god, by wolves?
<s> I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
<s> Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line.
<s> Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people collect beanie babies... I collect silver bullets.
<s> Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period?
<s> No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
<s> Interesting possibility.
<s> They do? Oh no...
<s> What about... those guys... I might have...
<s> Okay.
<s> You got a dog?
<s> Two bags for them, and one bag for your head in case her two fall off.
<s> Yeah and when we're mad at each other we're out of sync. It only works if you're on good terms.
<s> Why would you want to be a cop?
<s> He's been running money for the Mafia.
<s> That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
<s> Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
<s> One of our only leads... You had dates with both men right before they were killed.
<s> Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
<s> Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
<s> I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
<s> You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
<s> Yes.  This way.
<s> Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
<s> A hunch.  He might be able to...
<s> I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared.
<s> Yes.
<s> But I...
<s> You seem restless.
<s> Waves...  A beach.  A woman whispering.  That's all.  I need to stay awake.  Do you have any pills?
<s> That's what people keep telling me.
<s> Well...
<s> I have to go...
<s> Don't ask stupid questions.  Look at it.
<s> It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
<s> Right.
<s> `Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
<s> I mean,  if it's a problem...
<s> Alan
<s> You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
<s> You think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months!
<s> Oh.  Excuse me.
<s> How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
<s> Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought it was a nice touch.
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> I'm not surprised.  Can we save anywhere?
<s> Extend things?
<s> I know...  I know...  It's difficult for all of us.  But sometimes we have to put our personal feelings aside and focus on the gQod of the country.
<s> Oh, yeah... probably...
<s> I'm not sure... I might have.
<s> What?
<s> It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
<s> She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.
<s> Fine.
<s> Absolutely.  Well, that might be kind of tough. Once the press starts smelling blood...
<s> He's not.
<s> Perceptual?
<s> Dirty business we're in sometimes.
<s> Really?
<s> No.
<s> `Bleed for your king.'
<s> Yeah, but Bob found me when I was stuck in Firearms and Tobacco...
<s> What's wrong with a magic trick?
<s> Oh, they didn't brief you on that? How sloppy of them.
<s> What?
<s> You have a lot of secrets.
<s> I run a temp agency.
<s> You find people jobs?
<s> It's just more than anybody else does around here.
<s> Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.
<s> ... Me, too.
<s> We're doing our best, sir.
<s> And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it?
<s> NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!
<s> Leave him.
<s> I have looked bad for four years. Everyone in the world has looked bad for four years. Thank God looks don't matter as much as they once did.
<s> I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by...
<s> How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
<s> That sounds like a curse to me.
<s> That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
<s> Datura.
<s> We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.
<s> The hospital? 
<s> They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this.
<s> We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
<s> I tol' him. I tol' him this is a dead place. Like all the others.
<s> PULL IN! GET THE OTHERS.
<s> God....damn you, Rhodes!
<s> They will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh. I'm prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to see to it they don't get mine! Not while I'm still using it!
<s> That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
<s> We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
<s> For the good of mankind. That's what every monster-maker says.
<s> Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
<s> I'm alright. Let's go.
<s> Will do.
<s> Terrible.  Awful!  I met the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life!
<s> Women swoon!
<s> Well?
<s> I'll tell you later.
<s> Oh come on, Pitts...
<s> Wait a minute, Charlie. This should belong to the club.
<s> So much the better.
<s> I'm sorry.  I, we
<s> What?
<s> Good.  We're very excited about him.  He was a Rhodes Scholar, you know.
<s> Oh yeah.  Sure.  Valedictorian, National Merit Scholar
<s> What good will that do?
<s> It's better than doing nothing.
<s> Stop what?
<s> I don't care.  I love you, Chris.  You deserve better than Chet and I'm it. Please accept these.
<s> Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?
<s> Dead Poets honor.
<s> Meeks.
<s> Oh, Captain, My Captain. Is there poetry in math?
<s> A barbaric yawp.
<s> A... A  sweaty-toothed madman.
<s> I have something.
<s> Ah, but I am seeing the world, Neil. The new world.  Seeing a student like you take root and bloom.  It's worth everything.  That's why I came back here. A place like this needs at least one teacher like me.  Did you come here to talk about my teaching?
<s> You can't live a life for someone else, Neil.  You can only live for yourself. Have you told your father what you just told me?  Have you shown him your passion about acting?
<s> It's not too bad.  It's a tragedy! Why does she have to be in love with a jerk?!
<s> I don't know.
<s> Yeah, you just do everything they say! You'll be in daddy's law firm as sure as I'm standing here.  And you'll be approving loans till you croak.
<s> But she's in love with: the moron son of my father's best friend.  What would the dead poets say about that?
<s> Nothing.  No mention of it.
<s> Then you can help him.
<s> Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
<s> Todd Anderson.
<s> From my father and Nolan.
<s> No thanks.
<s> You know what they say...the classics are eternal.
<s> And where is our point of arrival?
<s> Which question is that?
<s> Dead.
<s> Or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be.
<s> I saved your life is what I did!
<s> The thieves.
<s> I don't know...
<s> Quite a few.
<s> Anti social?
<s> Right... You have a boat.
<s> Oh yeah? What kind is that?
<s> You ain't giving the orders here!
<s> That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
<s> That way.
<s> Poolside?
<s> Like Mamooli's country...
<s> John...
<s> What happened to Vivo?! What the hell happened to Vivo?
<s> She fucked me.
<s> Get the boots.
<s> Hey! Fuckin' A! Just... just like a hot shit... except cold.
<s> Yeah, Sal--
<s> Jesus, it's freezing!
<s> Fuckin' A. It's gotta!
<s> It's Nick!
<s> No.
<s> But you must come in.
<s> How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?
<s> I show you. Come. You come.  Linda have special, crazy fuck. That right?
<s> Linda, yeah.
<s> Shhh! Albert's gonna hump the Coup de Ville.
<s> Who's got the ammo?
<s> Fine. Hey, I'm fine.
<s> Nick, she won't say why.
<s> Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.
<s> Biederman!
<s> Linda, Linda...!
<s> Will you marry me?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee.
<s> Naw, it's... This guy wants his money.
<s> No. No, no.
<s> Right here.
<s> Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
<s> Pow.
<s> It's ahead, Vince.
<s> They bombed last night, right? Didn't they bomb? If they bombed last night, they could bomb tonight. They could be up there right now!
<s> With more bullets?... Against each other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!!!
<s> Sit down.
<s> Merle... Hey, Merle, listen...  Why?
<s> No!!!?
<s> What do you mean, no???
<s> John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
<s> Here. Behind you.
<s> Merle? ... Merle's alive?  How do you know?
<s> But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?
<s> Phantom Mary?
<s> What's it for??
<s> You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
<s> Kimberly!
<s> Your mother.
<s> Put that on your political resume.
<s> I'm not voting for you.
<s> You're crazy.
<s> You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.
<s> Technothugs.
<s> This is where I found Doucet twenty years ago.  Thought maybe he'd come back.
<s> Hey, Rip Van Winkle, maybe we'd better call it a night.
<s> Thanks.
<s> We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
<s> Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.
<s> No, sir.
<s> <u>Comwatch Dispatch System</u>.  Can't assimilate voice stress.  Code priority only.
<s> ...Have you been drinking?
<s> They always are.
<s> No, Jabez -- your place is with your wife --
<s> They are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain.  Welcome! Help yourselves to drinks! Glad you could come! Have a good time.
<s> That's my problem, Belle.
<s> Why? It don't hurt.
<s> Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
<s> No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.
<s> I did not, Grandma.
<s> Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
<s> Now don't you worry about that. You just leave it all to me. We won't talk business now ... just bear this in mind ... I'm not the man to get rich on other people's hard luck.... No, sir... not me! ...
<s> Belle.
<s> Hello, Stevens ... you're early today.
<s> You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
<s> Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--
<s> Oh, you know the old story -- the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga. Some of the gold has been buried under your barn!
<s> A pin, Neighbor Stone! I'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?
<s> They'd have a good neighbor, Jabez -- and that's worth much more than anything else -- much, much more!
<s> Well? Don't a politician have to be?
<s> Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?
<s> 5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
<s> He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
<s> Oh, Jabez.
<s> Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man.
<s> Hello, Jabez --  Here's your son.
<s> All right, Jabez ...
<s> Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.
<s> Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
<s> Now look here, Ma. I'm not a boy anymore. I want that understood. I don't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life. Mary's got to be the kind of wife a -- a big man needs --
<s> Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you.
<s> And I say she won't! I'll not have the scorn of God on this place -- with the smell of fish in it, polluting up the Sabbath!  And as for you -- let me tell you, young woman...!
<s> Of course it's all right, son. You had Daniel Webster, didn't ye?  Breakfast's ready!  I've made a special surprise for Mr. Webster.
<s> H'm. Hessian gold. Well -- hope it'll do us more good than it did the Hessians.
<s> I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!
<s> Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa's the only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall, Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet.
<s> Yes, sir -- I guess I do -- Gee --
<s> Of course not --
<s> Are you, Mary?  Well, I guess I'm glad myself -- seeing as how you feel this way.  Party seems to be quite a success.  Lots of guests, anyhow.
<s> My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn't let people see any softness in you, Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness, you know. Come out of there -- I'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea.
<s> Why don't you?
<s> Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo.
<s> They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
<s> How about his job?
<s> I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband.  Hi there.
<s> Tell me about it.
<s> What does he want?
<s> If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
<s> I read about them in Time magazine.  When these Revolutionary Brothers and Sisters are Free, the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in helicopters to the Los Angeles International Airport where you will be given further instructions.  You have two hours to comply.
<s> William Clay.  Call me Bill.
<s> I've seen enough phoney ID's in my time to recognize that the ones they've got cost a fortune.  Add all that up and I don't know what the fuck it means, but these are bad ass preps and they're here to stay.
<s> The plastique I found.  Is the building on fire?
<s> It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.
<s> Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
<s> Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
<s> I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
<s> Fuck you, sir - if I'm right, I don't need you.  What I want is - if I make an honest mistake I want help.
<s> What about the kids?
<s> Heidi, I'm dying.
<s> The robbers in the bank.  They got guns?
<s> Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can help you save your soul ...
<s> Yeah.  It was terrible.
<s> Yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death?  Don't talk about death to me.  I have been living with death for the last six months.  Why do you think I'm in the hospital?  I take a handful of pills to get away from you.  And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again.  I have no friends left.  No job.  I can't live.  I have to live with people. This death business... I'm sorry!
<s> You're really crazy.
<s> God, Algeria!  Do you know there's a bunch of... they walk around there... God!  People walk around with masks and things on their heads.  They're a bunch of crazy people there.
<s> I like that... yeah!
<s> Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's a snow job.  Don't listen to that shit!
<s> Shit...
<s> All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
<s> Look... who's on the phone?
<s> All right, enough!  Who the fuck is on the phone... anyway?  Is that you Moretti?  You on the phone?  Will somebody talk to me?
<s> Oh no!
<s> One word.  You won't find it in the phone book.
<s> I don't know, Sonny.  I don't know if the helicopters can land in here. I'll have to check it out.  I got superiors, unnerstan?  They don't always see eye to eye with me. I'll do what I can.
<s> He hasn't so far.  I'm the one who can make a mistake.  That's what scares the shit out of me.
<s> Do what the gentleman says, Howard.
<s> I don't care who you are ...  I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
<s> I don't know, Sonny ... on the roof somewhere I guess.
<s> They look like good kids.
<s> I'm glad it's okay.
<s> Howard!
<s> What about Howard?
<s> Oh, a long time.  Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be?  He wasn't around here.  I thought maybe he was in prison or some place.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette.
<s> Pure?
<s> Yeah - it's all right... let's go.
<s> Get 'em in the vault!
<s> How'd that happen?
<s> What?
<s> I'll tell you right now - that I'm ready to do it.
<s> All right ... send them the guard.
<s> It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world. Safer than a car.  Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right ... they're great ...
<s> They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual.  I want you to stop them saying that.
<s> I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages.
<s> Goodbye, honey.  Wish us luck!
<s> I said you were never a faggot.
<s> Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
<s> What'll you do?  Come out.
<s> No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son.
<s> Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids. I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week?

<s> We're not hanging out.  I'm being escorted back to work.
<s> I don't know how he does it.

<s> Oh, no. You're not gettin' me again.
<s> Maybe I should go home and grade papers. Owwww.
<s> You can't marry my mom.
<s> Hey, where did you come from?
<s> Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
<s> So, have you given him "some" yet? 
<s> Go away, assface.
<s> Who?
<s> What do you mean? We can't go in there or we'll be "it".
<s> I know I did.
<s> It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
<s> Do you know what this means?
<s> Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
<s> How could she miss this? This whole salute to Collins was her idea.
<s> Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
<s> That's the one I wanted.
<s> Special Needs class.
<s> Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.
<s> Tomorrow night?
<s> Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
<s> You were born free and free you should remain.
<s> Go in there and get us two slushees.
<s> Ha! I said "doll-hairs." Psych! But a deal's a deal, my friend. In you go.
<s> It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
<s> It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets...
<s> So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
<s> People! Come on. "Parade" float.
<s> Museum huh, haven't been there since my husband left me. I love art.
<s> Oh, yeah he was straight all right, just wasn't very good in the sack. I used to give him directions. Higher, lower, faster, harder, small circles, do the alphabet. Useless.
<s> We start our own class?
<s> What?
<s> No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.

<s> So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
<s> They said you were dead.  They said...
<s> They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.  I will try to pass within.
<s> You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach...  I'm something different, something unexpected!  I'm a seed.  I am so much more...  You don't begin to know me...
<s> I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.
<s> No one. It... seemed the proper way.
<s> Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
<s> I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.
<s> You feel the flesh crisping?
<s> I've heard enough of my safety... What about my father?... I heard you talking. You speak as if he was dead. Well, he isn't!
<s> My father sent you to test me. Music then?
<s> I predict we're lost.
<s> Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?
<s> They do?  Shoot.  There <u>must</u> be a way to get around that...
<s> Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do...
<s> I never said I could ad-lib...
<s> This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.
<s> So why didn't you do it?
<s> Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while.
<s> This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
<s> Huh?
<s> That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
<s> I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
<s> Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
<s> Absolutely!  It's just the beginning. I promise this: If we stick together, one day I'll make every single one of you famous.
<s> Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
<s> This is my way of telling you --
<s> Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
<s> Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
<s> That's the problem!  <u>Nobody</u> cares about my movie!  I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!
<s> Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made "Glen Or Glenda."  Directing <u>is</u> my day job.
<s> That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
<s> I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here.  Say, who's the lug?
<s> But you used to say --
<s> I understand you just moved here?
<s> I don't know.  Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?
<s> I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.
<s> Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
<s> Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
<s> Would that work?
<s> Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
<s> Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
<s> Oh, of course!
<s> But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
<s> I like.  When do movie shoot?
<s> It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
<s> Are you a fruit?
<s> You gotta be kiddin' me.
<s> I don't think he's a schmuck.
<s> I did.  I established some tits and ass.
<s> Not good...
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Huh?
<s> No! I love sex with girls.
<s> Bela died.
<s> The sun.
<s> I don't know.
<s> We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
<s> NOOOOO!!!
<s> Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
<s> Who?
<s> Look, you seem like a nice guy, Ed, but you're just not my type.  But keep in touch.  Let me know when your movie opens.
<s> What if--you're vomiting?
<s> Come on...
<s> Went --
<s> This is real, Bananahead!
<s> No, uh...
<s> You asked me if I had a dream. I said "Sure, I have a dream. I just don't know what it is yet."
<s> What are you talking about? He's fine. He's out of the hospital already. The ratings are higher than ever.
<s> Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?
<s> Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
<s> Yeah. The camera guy is here.
<s> He made a mistake.
<s> No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
<s> Mm.
<s> Oh my God!!
<s> It was horrible. He called me up.
<s> Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
<s> Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
<s> She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
<s> Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
<s> Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this drunken woman you?
<s> Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
<s> What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
<s> Well, when you put it that way.
<s> Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?
<s> Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.
<s> The what?
<s> Oh yeah.
<s> Shari...
<s> No. Who?
<s> So?
<s> Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
<s> Come on, let's go.
<s> Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
<s> Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show.
<s> ...yeah?
<s> Come on.
<s> What did you do to your hair?
<s> Oh man! They couldn't pick me! They had to pick you!
<s> What?
<s> Ray --
<s> You watching the ballgame?
<s> We'd better go...
<s> Stop? I'm a guy. I don't stop. The woman's supposed to stop. We're the gas, they're the brakes.
<s> I know.
<s> Me?! That's you!
<s> Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
<s> What...
<s> What?... Why?
<s> We have to stop meeting like this.
<s> Good?
<s> I'm not talking about ethics.  I'm talking about morals.
<s> You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but...
<s> Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
<s> Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
<s> I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.
<s> Yes, I do.
<s> You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
<s> Right
<s> Sure
<s> Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious.  I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!
<s> 6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
<s> Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"
<s> Why are you lecturing me?
<s> You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Doing what?
<s> You'll be fine.
<s> You will.
<s> Here?
<s> Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.
<s> I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
<s> No way I It doesn't make sense.
<s> And 290 "disregards," right?
<s> I'm not like you.
<s> I don't care.
<s> It's a conflict of interest.  And Paul was first.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Don't you fucking knock?
<s> Okay, Paul.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.
<s> What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
<s> Yeah, plain scotch.
<s> No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
<s> Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
<s> So tell me about it.
<s> Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing.
<s> What work?
<s> What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Look at a picture for me.
<s> No!  Please leave!
<s> Yeah.  A great big one.
<s> Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
<s> Get the fuck away from me.
<s> Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
<s> They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
<s> I'm not asking you.
<s> I am.  Are you soliciting for police charities?  The last time, you people called at my office.
<s> I don't know him.  Mr...
<s> Against your code?
<s> Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
<s> His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
<s> Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
<s> The public demands justice, sir. This was a full-fledged riot of policemen.  Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.  Force them to retire.  But someone has to swing.  Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White.  Secure them jail time.  Feed them to the sharks, sir.  Protect yourself; protect the department.
<s> I never truck with no sissies!
<s> Gone.  Not a trace.
<s> He runs call girls.  Primo tail. Fixed up like movie stars.
<s> In my car.  Blackmail shit.  The trunk under the carpet.  Patchett got me to photograph a cop fucking this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks just like Veronicaaa --
<s> We got a call earlier on three Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.
<s> Why?
<s> You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
<s> What about you?
<s> It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently.
<s> You should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the Nite Owl, <u>Lieutenant</u>.
<s> Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My father ran into him off duty.  He shot my father six times and got away clean.  No one even knew who he was.  I made the name up to give him some personality.
<s> I've given up angles for awhile. I just want to solve this thing.
<s> What's Fleur-de-Lis?
<s> What?
<s> Bud White grilled me on it this morning.  You know, he's not as dumb as I thought.
<s> Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
<s> Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
<s> He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you.  And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink?
<s> Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
<s> I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
<s> I don't hate White.  I really don't.  It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.
<s> Why not?
<s> You're the first person to ever call me tough.
<s> I know how he feels.
<s> Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
<s> I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
<s> No.  It's felony possession of marijuana.
<s> Where'd you hear that?
<s> Nothing.
<s> I'm telling you, I--
<s> He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
<s> Don't know. Did you check everywhere? Maybe it was hidden in something. Maybe there was someone else--
<s> Who are you calling?!
<s> So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
<s> Listen to me--
<s> Turn on CNN.
<s> Do it!
<s> Wait.
<s> 230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
<s> If you find something, chalk the Baltimore Sheraton mailbox and go to Temperanceville. It's South of Salisbury.  And take this.
<s> We said a hundred.
<s> One-twenty.
<s> I called from a payphone!
<s> How'd you have the manpower to--
<s> What's going on?
<s> Where?
<s> 'Kay, well, could you walk faster, please.
<s> We're not gonna hurt you.
<s> How fast can you learn?
<s> We'll have to re-stock some basics.
<s> AmeriTech's data-base.  There's Albert's D.C. office address and his phone's identity code. Now we just reprogram out phone with his ID code and you know what we've got?
<s> It's Pat Cary. I work for Senator Sam Albert and I was given Jerry's name.
<s> What are you saying?
<s> Law enforcement?
<s> Are you sure about this?
<s> Oh my God.
<s> I'm married.
<s> Yes. I have her permission.
<s> Is that good?
<s> Pardon?
<s> Could you give me just a moment to talk to a friend of mine here? Not about this, but...Daniel?
<s> <u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
<s> Oh...yeah, I didn't see the accident.
<s> About what?
<s> Because I don't know.
<s> Just for the criminals.
<s> Something bad happened tonight.
<s> It's okay.
<s> Well, you know--
<s> That's okay.
<s> You opened the thing?
<s> Yeah.  I wish you could've met...
<s> A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.
<s> It's not?
<s> That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
<s> It's how he works.
<s> Eat your fish.
<s> Mr. Zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme. We believe he passed you sensitive materials, possibly with your knowledge, and we need to--
<s> We believe he did.
<s> We have good reason to believe that he passed you--
<s> --otherwise we may have to--
<s> Oh, well, that's true.
<s> Mr. Dean--
<s> Are those my Christmas presents?
<s> Dad!
<s> Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
<s> Alright!
<s> What about jewelry?
<s> They only took electrical appliances.
<s> An investigation? It was a bus accident.
<s> No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
<s> Yeah?
<s> He's clever. He had help.
<s> And if it wasn't?
<s> The door was open, sir. I just need a signature.
<s> Puffed cheese?
<s> Excuse me.
<s> I was concerned.  As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to.
<s> Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
<s> Pardon?
<s> I thought you might paste them into your book.
<s> I'm quite all right, thank you.
<s> Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
<s> No.
<s> No, no, it's Hungarian.  My daijka sang it to me.
<s> You bastard, I was believing you!
<s> We've got to get you out of here.
<s> What?
<s> I'm just going to find things for the fire.
<s> What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
<s> Right.
<s> Shut-up!
<s> I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.
<s> She can take you as far as Florence.
<s> Finally!  So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
<s> And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
<s> The rest meant nothing to me.
<s> You can't kill me.  I died years ago.
<s> Aren't you?
<s> Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
<s> What?
<s> Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
<s> Are you crazy?
<s> I'm not sewing anything else.
<s> The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
<s> I should go to the house, get breakfast.
<s> I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
<s> Does he have to go?
<s> How awful.  What will you do?
<s> No, please.  I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Almásy, who doesn't look up from his book.
<s> Go on, do it.  I don't need to hear any more.
<s> No.  I think I was a pilot.  I was found near the wreckage of a plane by the Bedouin.  I was with them for some time.
<s> This was your garden?
<s> How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
<s> We're getting close.
<s> I'm in the middle.
<s> It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
<s> Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
<s> Well, no...but...
<s> Roki has a vivid imagination.
<s> Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
<s> That's my girl.
<s> Look on the back. What do you see?
<s> I'm not the one to ask...
<s> I never carry...baggage.
<s> I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
<s> It is.  Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.
<s> As I recall, you've robbed it before.
<s> They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
<s> You don't get the Mask code unless I go.
<s> No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
<s> We get the Mask I'll tell you.
<s> Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
<s> Let's just see how we do.
<s> Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it.
<s> Ready.
<s> Got it.
<s> There is no big job.
<s> My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
<s> Everything.
<s> You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.
<s> My job, my rules.
<s> Where the money is.
<s> It's no good without the argon gas.
<s> Like a woman of mystery.
<s> Charged.
<s> We can't leave it IN THERE, it's got all our accounts, everything that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!!
<s> Get out of here!
<s> But--
<s> You gave them the eight billion.
<s> Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
<s> How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
<s> Suspicious, after all these years?
<s> You're impressed with her, aren't you?
<s> You know where my loyalties lie.
<s> You're giving them to me?
<s> Thought you had to use some of these.
<s> You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
<s> What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
<s> What do you think?  What's this?
<s> Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
<s> Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her fault, she says.  And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think?
<s> Nothing you can't show up for with a stain.
<s> Yeah.  There's two.  Why?
<s> You're a lawyer?
<s> Yeah, I can see that.  I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff?
<s> The what?
<s> It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.
<s> Not around here.  This is a rough part of the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck.  It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die.
<s> Sure you are.  You're just a happier woman, cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire.
<s> For what?
<s> It's enough -- for whatever you need, for whatever your girls need, for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.
<s> Yup.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> You wanna know, you gotta hire me back.  I got a lot of bills to pay.
<s> Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh?  And <u>you</u> fired <u>me</u>.  Jesus.
<s> Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
<s> I know how DNA works, Erin --
<s> I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.
<s> Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.
<s> We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
<s> D'you get his name?  Course not.  Jesus, Ed --
<s> Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh?
<s> Yeah.  Yeah, I'm ... fine.
<s> Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
<s> Reasons PG&E thinks it shouldn't go to --
<s> He's got a reputation for doing all his --
<s> Erin, it's just a meeting.
<s> "Fun?"  Jesus, "<u>fun</u>?"  I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun?"
<s> Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that for the appeal.
<s> You're not gonna be there.
<s> Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
<s> Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
<s> That's right.
<s> Ross -- you are an absolute angel.
<s> How come you're not eating?
<s> Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.
<s> It happens all the time.
<s> Yup.  They must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane.
<s> Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's gonna take who where is a little easier over at Randy's house.
<s> What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?
<s> Well, I'm the neighbors.  There, now we're introduced, so you can shut the fuck up.
<s> I do.
<s> How?
<s> Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
<s> Better safe than sorry.
<s> Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
<s> I didn't say that.
<s> What do you want, a joke?
<s> Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here.  Beth started talking.
<s> Cause it's my office party.  If you had an office, I'd go to your party.
<s> Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of these folks aren't.
<s> I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
<s> What?
<s> I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
<s> Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
<s> Yes?
<s> Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
<s> No one put me up to anything.  I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
<s> Well, if you're talking about contamination, you're getting out of my area of expertise. Let me give you the name of a toxicologist friend of mine over at USC.
<s> Yes, Admiral .... soon.
<s> He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to start the training.
<s> Ben ... Ben ...
<s> But Han and Leia will surely die.
<s> Everyone's invited, of course.
<s> Barks and growls at his boss.
<s> You know the Jedi Master?
<s> It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
<s> Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.
<s> I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?
<s> Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
<s> You said you were going to stay. What happened?
<s> We are fighting for a cause much ...
<s> An Imperial probe droid.
<s> Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?
<s> Good.
<s> How do I look?
<s> Look, we just got this bucket going again.  I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...
<s> No lightspeed?
<s> Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
<s> Here ... near the Anoat system.
<s> Can you trust him?
<s> Hyperdrive.
<s> His fate is sealed.  You'll be lucky to get out yourself.  All systems are on alert.  everything's locked.
<s> Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.
<s> I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> He'll survive.
<s> Why not me?
<s> No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
<s> I thought those seekers were set for stun!
<s> Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.
<s> You'll find I'm full of surprises.
<s> Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
<s> We know that.
<s> With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
<s> Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time.  Somebody else was in there with her.
<s> Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south.
<s> You never heard of Snake Plissken?
<s> Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your girl back, I got it all. Just for you, Cuervo. Just for you.
<s> Where's Plissken?
<s> You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
<s> My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?
<s> Don't lie to me.
<s> What's the little black box do?
<s> So what does this thing do?
<s> Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
<s> So where's Plissken?
<s> Does he know how to activate it?
<s> Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God.
<s> Yeah. The place kept changing owners. Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris killed 'em.
<s> Which way?
<s> Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
<s> They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
<s> Sewers. Come on.
<s> What the hell is this?
<s> Yeah.
<s> ...I saw nothing.
<s> Of Merlin?
<s> Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
<s> I had to weave a little enchantment on the bees so I could get some honey, and I didn't feel up to using any more magic just yet. Anyway, I was in less danger than you'll be in today.
<s> Your mother told you that?
<s> And I offer only this, Father. To commit with passion and pleasure all the evils that you failed to commit, as man and king.
<s> So be it.
<s> Well hurry then, and get it.
<s> I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
<s> --Nothing!
<s> Fuck it.
<s> Why don't you let me?
<s> I can't believe it.
<s> We still don't know.
<s> Really? wow.
<s> Yes, I go now.
<s> Karl!!
<s> No thanks Karl.
<s> What is it? A tranquilizer?
<s> Never.
<s> Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
<s> The temperal lobe is very common. Could last for days, even weeks. It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour.
<s> Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
<s> It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
<s> Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
<s> But how?
<s> Oh, will you help her! Just help her!
<s> Like what?
<s> I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
<s> Not at all. Why d'you ask?
<s> The closet
<s> No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
<s> Well, maybe he's sleeping.
<s> You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
<s> How do you know?
<s> So what's next?
<s> Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
<s> Stealing is a sin.
<s> No.
<s> Intensely.
<s> In time.
<s> La plume de ma tante.
<s> Holy water.
<s> How's your leg?
<s> Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.
<s> I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
<s> Let us pray. Holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who once and for all consigned that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell. Who sent your only begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion.
<s> She'll go into coma.
<s> Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
<s> From the psychiatric end.
<s> Couldn't it of happened on the fall.
<s> Unlikely.
<s> Sick priest, is that it?
<s> I don't know anyone who fits the description.
<s> Incidentally I mention only in passing that I could tell the judge that it was a matter of confession.
<s> Shove it up your ass you faggot!
<s> Fuck him!!!
<s> You wanted to see me, Charlie?
<s> Little slow tonight.
<s> We have some lotion.
<s> No bones?
<s> The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
<s> Yes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer. Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named Jack. I guess I just can't help making the association.
<s> Am I late?
<s> You look like you just crawled out of bed.
<s> Lotta water.
<s> She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
<s> Bosen black.  Flat.
<s> You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
<s> It's me.
<s> No.
<s> It's just an idea.  I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?
<s> We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?
<s> You, Frank.  All these years you been telling me we're different.  We got novelty, Jack. No one can touch us.
<s> It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
<s> Let's get it over with.
<s> That's it except for the first. We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the Holiday Inn on Sixtieth.  All three-day turns.
<s> You recognized me.
<s> Thanks, but I've got plans.
<s> Not true.  Besides, Jack's the romantic.
<s> Right.
<s> Okay.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
<s> I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
<s> It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
<s> Fine.
<s> Half-hour.  Once I finish this octave I'm gonna get breakfast.  You see what's on the buffet?
<s> How come I didn't hear anything?
<s> Yeah.
<s> I can't make the tenth.
<s> I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me to be?
<s> I don't know. Some disease.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Seventy-one
<s> No, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He wasn't a hero.  He was a fool.
<s> Who's weak now, big brother?
<s> There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ...
<s> Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
<s> We ran long.
<s> Uh ... Frank Baker.  This is my brother.
<s> Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
<s> My wife wears a seven.  You don't look like a seven to me.
<s> Nine?
<s> Uh... good.
<s> They're nines.
<s> Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
<s> I was gonna split it with you guys.
<s> Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
<s> Baker's unabridged.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Tell her.
<s> What?
<s> Yes, well, they are.
<s> Funny job.
<s> Come on, Ed.
<s> His kid's sick.
<s> Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be one crazy dame.  Shit.
<s> Every year.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Look. You don't know good. All right?
<s> How come you didn't close your eyes?
<s> Soap?
<s> You're kidding.
<s> Yeah.  Got my own sign.
<s> No.
<s> Another five years, huh?
<s> Sounds big.  What's he do?
<s> Looks old.
<s> Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it?
<s> Good to see you, Ma.
<s> Eddie.
<s> ... Thanks.
<s> What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?
<s> My place.
<s> Yes.  Pollux bought one along with the original batch.  Obviously, he found a way to make more.
<s> He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb.
<s> You're not my brother.  The brother I knew would never have been caught by that dumb fuck Archer.  At least tell me the bomb is still going off.
<s> You shoot hoops like a chick, you smoke like a wuss, and -- I don't know -- you're different.
<s> Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
<s> Were you there to catch me?
<s> Eve, listen carefully.  The man you think is your husband -- isn't.
<s> Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ...
<s> Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you --
<s> Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.
<s> Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
<s> Just make sure you're there.  On time.
<s> I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
<s> You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
<s> Not anymore.
<s> Five seconds.
<s> Pollux is -- what?
<s> Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
<s> What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
<s> Like you know anything about it.
<s> You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
<s> Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
<s> What?
<s> Business first.  I went into the "Warrants" system and erased your records.  You're clean.  In fact, you're now on the informant payroll.
<s> No -- the best part is, since it's a government job -- they can't fire you!  But how can you be sure you'll get the appointment?
<s> Good, because I checked your salary -- and it bites.  How the everyday working-class stiff survives in today's economy is something I'll never ...
<s> What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
<s> It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
<s> The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
<s> I'm not going anywhere.
<s> Can't you see I'm trying to change?  I sent Jamie off because I wanted to be alone with you.  I wanted to see the candle-light dance in your beautiful --
<s> Okay, I have a confession to make.  But you aren't going to like it.
<s> Good.  Because I'm fed up.
<s> Sure, baby -- go anywhere you want.  But I have to give you an escort.  Security reasons.
<s> Back then -- who wasn't?
<s> I don't know.  Maybe...
<s> Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
<s> Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.
<s> What about me?
<s> Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
<s> Mary Had A Little Lamb.
<s> Ringing my bell...
<s> Maybe I don’t say it enough but you moving in next door to me...
<s> Hey, I’m doing the best I can...  I’d like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...
<s> She wants to have an affair with me.
<s> No.
<s> Look, I'm talking about a business deal here.  I buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter...  ...doesn't have a death wish  ...I just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars.
<s> Me?
<s> How much time?!
<s> Look, I just want my life back.  Now what’s it gonna take?  You wanna talk turkey?  Let’s talk turkey!  How much money...?
<s> You know what the word glimpse means, J? It’s by nature an impermanent thing.
<s> You draw lines with pencil!  I know about this!
<s> Well do whatever it is you do well, and just...just do it. Excuse me...
<s> Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
<s> Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home.
<s> Maybe you’re not hearing me.  I am Jack Campbell...  Right here.  Jack Campbell, President...
<s> Uh huh...
<s> Well, I’m just a little confused right now about why I work here...
<s> What are you talking about?  It’s me, Jack Campbell.  Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
<s> No, you’re right.  What are we doing?
<s> I was in the city.
<s> Telling my mother she doesn’t have to stay with the kids.
<s> Pro bono.  You don’t get paid at all.  Nobody makes a dime.  Well, bravo...
<s> No, she’s not.
<s> Do what?
<s> Really.
<s> Surprise.  We’re pregnant...  Yeah...that must’ve been...I mean that was very unexpected.  But what are you gonna do, right?
<s> Sure.  I really like Annie.
<s> Long, boring, and generally pretty sad. Arnie seemed to enjoy it...  Hey, where’s that chocolate cake...?
<s> Sorry, Jack.  It’s too important to me.
<s> I want it...
<s> Zeena...
<s> What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until it’s light out.
<s> And now...?
<s> But you always seem so certain.
<s> What are you sure about?
<s> No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
<s> Then get a goddamn snow blower!
<s> It’s good to see you...
<s> What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
<s> We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
<s> But you’re not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
<s> So we'll get egg nog.
<s> Yes!
<s> Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
<s> I'm blind, not deaf.  Wanna come in?
<s> Oh, you remember my name do you?  You happen to remember what you <u>swore</u> to do with every breath in your body?
<s> Put your tiny little mind at ease.
<s> I don't care about rocks, I care about <u>you</u>.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
<s> That's terrible news...
<s> I can go hotter!
<s> Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>?  What if we have some, you know...like, calling?
<s> Not this again --
<s> <u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
<s> Dude.  That's my sister.
<s> No, <u>I'm</u> sorry, for pushing you out.
<s> Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
<s> Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
<s> Right.  That's exactly what I meant.
<s> Great minds think alike.
<s> Yes, thanks.
<s> You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
<s> Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap.
<s> What about you?  You haven't eaten in days.  How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
<s> Excuse me?
<s> I think it was a little more complicated than --
<s> No way to know.  Without more tests, experiments.
<s> I gave him twenty.
<s> A <u>gasket</u>?  Reed, we're at a party.
<s> Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
<s> Raising the shields.
<s> Just <u>find</u> him.
<s> I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
<s> Please, no apologies.  I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.  You'll have round-the clock care.
<s> Medical's ready.
<s> It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
<s> That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
<s> If I were in their place and I'd run out of time, I'd abandon the ship before I grew to dangerous size... and use the few extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible, on my own...
<s> We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
<s> Why don't you go on. We'll meet you at the Clearance Desk in a few minutes.
<s> Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
<s> They're much smaller than bacteria...
<s> Now I know...
<s> Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --
<s> No, it requires such absolute precision --
<s> Nothing -- against all that force.
<s> Take a close look at your Soul, and your Infinity, and your God out there --
<s> You mean Inner Space is endless?
<s> They all lead to the same place -- the Lungs.
<s> Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
<s> "Proclaiming in incandescent glory The myriad Mind of Man..."
<s> What about Dr. Michaels?
<s> How are you, Miss Peterson?
<s> Well, it seems to me if you reduce a ship to microscopic size -- and the stream remains constant -- we'd take quite a beating.
<s> Well, we better get on with it.
<s> They'll still be able to track us by radar, because of the radioactive fuel.
<s> We're safe -- long as it remains that color...  We're in the Pleural Sac.  It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.
<s> Sorry, but the situation has changed.
<s> I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
<s> Sort of.
<s> Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside.
<s> Enough to breathe, but that's all.
<s> Look at those Walls up ahead!
<s> Looks simple to operate.
<s> May I have your ticket, please?
<s> It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell!
<s> Certainly.
<s> I don't think so. It's nice.
<s> Or your fucking wife, Jerry.
<s> I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.
<s> The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
<s> Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
<s> Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
<s> I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
<s> Oh, geez.
<s> The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in?
<s> Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.  I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.
<s> Yah, but that TruCoat -
<s> Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat, you don't get it and you get oxidization problems. It'll cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert -
<s> End a April.
<s> Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
<s> Uh-huh - in what way?
<s> Yah, got a front movin' in.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Chaska.
<s> Hold on.
<s> ...My fee? Wade, what the heck're you talkin' about?
<s> No, no. See - they, no, see, they only deal with me. Ya feel this, this nervousness on the phone there, they're very - these guys're dangerous -
<s> What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
<s> Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
<s> Good day, sir.
<s> 2:30.
<s> Yah.
<s> Well, they -
<s> Ah, dammit!
<s> Nope.
<s> Yah.
<s> Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.
<s> Yah, woulda been cold out here.
<s> It's okay, Mike...
<s> Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
<s> No.
<s> Yah, he - he's been struggling. He's living with his parents now.
<s> Yah. Where are ya, Margie?
<s> Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
<s> Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
<s> No, no.
<s> Yah.
<s> Three-cent stamp.
<s> We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
<s> His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.
<s> Where's Tyler?
<s> I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.
<s> You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
<s> Pretend you're me.  You find this. What would you do?
<s> Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review...
<s> Just who the fuck do you think you are?!  Get out!  You're fired!
<s> Dynamite?
<s> Who do you think could've done this?
<s> It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
<s> A year?  How'd you manage that?
<s> You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
<s> Don't worry, I'm leaving.
<s> Would you do something for me?  I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast.  I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
<s> Feel anything?
<s> Nothing.
<s> Well... thanks, anyway.
<s> Answer the question!
<s> We've just lost cabin pressure.
<s> What... ?
<s> Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.
<s> What?
<s> Do this for me, Marla.  Do this for me, if you never do anything else...
<s> I can't let myself see where you're going.  Go wherever it takes you, remember... keep away from major cities...
<s> Don't ask.
<s> Okay, everyone.
<s> How's that working out for you?
<s> And, now it's gone.
<s> ...no ...no ...
<s> Delivered from Swedish furniture.
<s> Do what you like.
<s> Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
<s> I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
<s> It's called a "changeover."  The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
<s> It affords him other interesting opportunities.
<s> In reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can, there's the flash of Tyler's contribution...
<s> I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
<s> If you could fight any celebrity?
<s> Shatner.  William Shatner.
<s> She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
<s> Yes, I promise.
<s> "The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
<s> I don't know...
<s> It isn't... ?
<s> Nothing.  Do what you like.
<s> No.
<s> Look...
<s> Tyler...
<s> You're asking questions that don't have answers.  You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
<s> If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
<s> Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of this.  How's that?
<s> Wait a minute...
<s> Answer me, Tyler.
<s> I don't know!  Tell me!
<s> You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
<s> Fuck your struggle.  I want out.
<s> I quit.
<s> Not my mouth.  Our mouth.
<s> Thank you.  Thank you, sir...
<s> How'd you know?
<s> Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---
<s> Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.
<s> Death's list.  The precise order you're going to die in.
<s> I...I...
<s> So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
<s> No.  If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
<s> Speed up.
<s> That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.
<s> What about you, Kimberly?  Did you anyone from Flight-?
<s> Blow me.
<s> Good.  Cause we just got some new info and I don't need you getting freaky on me.
<s> Maybe.  What's this about?
<s> Just shut the fuck up and maybe you'll live.
<s> I think a nurse named Kalarjian is going to choke Isabella to death!
<s> I don't...what if I made a mistake?
<s> I know, honey.  I just --
<s> I know, Dad.
<s> Who am I, David Blane?
<s> Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'.
<s> It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.
<s> I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
<s> Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
<s> That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
<s> Look, there's something you should all know.
<s> Why do you think I was hiding?
<s> Did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. Sleeping pills?
<s> Oh, you've noticed it, too?
<s> No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control.
<s> 'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!
<s> Huh?
<s> Oh, yeah.  Listen, how long do they keep you in this disease hole?
<s> No.
<s> Start over.
<s> One hundred.
<s> No.
<s> That's a real good reason to wind up in 'Nam.
<s> There are no worse places.
<s> Yeah...
<s> She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
<s> Alright.  Home run.
<s> Nothing we can do, man.
<s> I have arranged transportation.  We meet soon.  But I think you to be disappointed.
<s> Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.
<s> Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
<s> What?
<s> The League of Families leans on Congress.  Then they lean on us. Like we don't have enough to worry about in a dozen dirtwater countries.  Damnit!
<s> Have fun.
<s> You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
<s> Of course not.  You can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran.
<s> Colonel.
<s> This just occurred to somebody, now?
<s> Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
<s> Well did you or didn't you?
<s> Well, I guess I'll come back then.
<s> You threw him out?
<s> <u>What are you, out of your mind</u>!
<s> I... I stayed at a friend's.  Listen, I --
<s> Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know...
<s> What does that mean?
<s> Well, what the hell does that mean?
<s> <u>You</u> made coffee?... You're going back to work <u>and</u> you made coffee?... I love this!
<s> No.  So what time do you need?  I love you -- you love me -- you want to get your career going, great!  I'd like to be a part of it -- I think I deserve that!  So what do you need to figure out alone!?
<s> How have you been?
<s> I... I... went to this bar... this very, ya know -- hard-to-get-in place... called Babbitt's...
<s> I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
<s> Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
<s> NO! I want a debutante on a horse to step on me.  Leave me alone!!
<s> You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
<s> Fine.  I'll say no.
<s> Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
<s> I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
<s> You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
<s> It's a classic.
<s> Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...
<s> Sure...
<s> What are the other reasons?
<s> Yeah.....Hey they're moving....  Am I doing that?
<s> It sounds exciting.
<s> Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.
<s> Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
<s> ... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
<s> I leave it to you.
<s> Look at these assholes! What the hell are they doing?!
<s> You're playing the other side.
<s> That's right, hand.
<s> Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
<s> No.
<s> What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
<s> Am I on TV?
<s> Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe.
<s> Who's Van Oost?
<s> Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
<s> I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.
<s> Then after that?
<s> Nothing. It's just that... I picked the easiest piece I could remember. I think I first played it when I was 8 years old and I played it better then.
<s> Look... You made a very calculated move, and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you. That wasn't necessary.
<s> Shut up...
<s> Will you let me talk to you, please?
<s> Oh. You have to tell me that.
<s> I hope it will, yes.  I'm sorry.
<s> No, the last time was three years ago.
<s> That's what I mean...
<s> At game, Carl.
<s> All right, let's have a rematch.
<s> Well, you're a romantic, Catherine, as are most musicians, and what's more, about to be married...
<s> Jesus, what a rude person...
<s> God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you.
<s> Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
<s> There's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up.
<s> I, umm, came to see you.
<s> I just wanted to see you.
<s> Nah, we make out and stuff.
<s> I did.
<s> I kissed those girls.
<s> I can't!
<s> What?
<s> Not really.
<s> You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
<s> I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
<s> You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops.
<s> Not a prayer.
<s> No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
<s> Well, which one?
<s> There is?
<s> Just relax.
<s> Like tonight.
<s> Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
<s> Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?
<s> Since he moved to L.A.
<s> Mrs. Stanwyk, may I borrow this picture. I promise to send it back to you. It's routine, really. The actuarial people need to --
<s> Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
<s> What?
<s> Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
<s> Yeah. Maybe.
<s> Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
<s> You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
<s> The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.
<s> Deal.
<s> Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
<s> No problem, boss.
<s> You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.
<s> I'm sorry?
<s> John! You used to fly together!
<s> It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
<s> Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
<s> So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.
<s> That's what I want to know.
<s> I'll take you to a game.
<s> But first I called the Hall of Records in Provo. They checked on the deed. You're telling the truth. A minute later Alan came in the room and asked me why I was shaking.
<s> Gail, please.
<s> Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
<s> Charged to the Underhills, sir?
<s> Sierra del fuego.
<s> Moved out.
<s> ...never reads the paper...
<s> You broke it? You know the source?
<s> Frank, you animal, I love it. I'll have the story by Thursday night, I swear to God.  I hope.
<s> Go to transportation, get a ticket.
<s> My secretary.
<s> Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here... I'm a new member.
<s> Of course.
<s> I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
<s> So you...
<s> I guess I'm not interested in any club who'll have my member as a member.  Later, Don...
<s> Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
<s> No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
<s> Make eye contact when you say that.
<s> Celebrate?  Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders?  Forget it, man.
<s> Contacts.
<s> Oh, Jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance!  Get that music off!
<s> Su-ure.  Two people hired me to find Zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and Colleen threw a tizz when we took hers.  Obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty.  But it's not necessary.  People are dead.  One was a friend.  The same people were involved in a scam to rip off Grendel Records. Bottom line's Julian Grendel is doing a little revenge number...
<s> I don't know.  I'm so scared. Help me.
<s> You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
<s> Okay?  I just blew up.  I feel orgasmic.
<s> Zuzu, be quiet.  Put in Colleen's disc.  Number two.
<s> But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.
<s> Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
<s> And hey, I appreciate it...
<s> Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
<s> Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
<s> Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...
<s> You were the lead sing -- Lieutenant, I didn't think anyone could cheer me up tonight... Thanks.  Really.
<s> Whatever you're getting paid, I can give you twenty, maybe thirty bucks more.
<s> I'm off it!
<s> The case!
<s> An asshole?  A swine?  A ballistic turd?  Pick one.  I never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and I had to take over the company.  You see the music is irrelevant in this industry.  I'm going to have to ship this 'wick-prick' platinum just so teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with.
<s> Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
<s> Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
<s> You're a poet and didn't know it.
<s> What?
<s> What?
<s> You made three sales to your roaches back there.  We had to chase you through all this shit and you tell me you're clean?
<s> Fake it.
<s> Marseilles.
<s> Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
<s> Walter, I can make this case if the Feds will get the hell out of my way.
<s> How'd I know he had a knife.
<s> He coulda been white.
<s> Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
<s> There's about a hundred years' parole time in there night or day.
<s> This could be it, Walter.  This Candy Store guy, putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections all over him. Then on our own, after working the whole day and night, we tail him out to Brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically, and who do we come up with?  Joel Weinstock.  You gotta let us have it.
<s> The other guy's a frog too.  Checked in at the Edison.  Had a hooker sent up.
<s> I say we keep sittin' on Boca.
<s> Whatta you got?
<s> This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
<s> What was it?
<s> You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?
<s> Nicky Moore.  Patty Ryan.  Mary Finelli. These names mean anything to you, asshole?  Julia Sullivan!  She mean anything?  She means something to me!
<s> We tried.  Bulkhead door's rusted shut. Won't budge.
<s> There's a manhole at Canal and Bowery.
<s> Elvis has left the building.
<s> Well, why not a little of the King?
<s> You didn't marry Donna Reed.
<s> I tucked him in at Gordo's.
<s> I think you know, Frank.
<s> How's that?
<s> Frank, please...
<s> Go watch the game?  Go watch the fucking game?  Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer.  It matches the Nightingale's profile.  You understand what that means?
<s> Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
<s> My dad's name was Frank Patrick Sullivan, he was a fire fighter and a die-hard Mets fan.  And every night when I went to bed he sang to me...  Take me out to the ball game, take me out with the crowd...
<s> I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.
<s> Nothing...I just spilled something.
<s> What?
<s> I don't know.
<s> I'm trying to be, Dad.  I'm tyrin'.  It's good to hear your voice.  I missed you...so much.
<s> Fire.
<s> What, Johnny?  What is it?
<s> October 22, 1969.
<s> I don't know...  What about the other women?
<s> We're okay...we're good, Dad.
<s> Yeah, I think so...
<s> It's not your fault, Dad.
<s> We did it, John.  We stopped him.
<s> Sully!  Is that you?
<s> No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
<s> April 16...?  That means she was the first.
<s> So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
<s> She's pretty special.
<s> Where are you going?
<s> We were looking for something to keep our hands busy.  It was either this or an orgy.  Vera chose this.  What're ya gonna do?
<s> I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
<s> I love you, man!
<s> This is all the exercise I need...
<s> Will you come with me?
<s> You go ahead...
<s> I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
<s> Hello.  How are you?
<s> You're irresistible.  I lose control.
<s> What?
<s> Did you stay here last night?
<s> Sure, just watch where you're going.
<s> Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
<s> Everything's gonna be fine.
<s> May be please have the wallet.
<s> Who's Horace?
<s> My ass.
<s> Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
<s> We have!  Trying to track you down.  The phone there is disconnected.
<s> It's just beginning.
<s> Why?
<s> Huh?
<s> Will you listen, dammit!
<s> Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
<s> There's no time for this bullshit...
<s> I've seen it.
<s> Please don't do anything crazy.
<s> You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
<s> 'Night, Josh.
<s> Maybe you should mind your own business.
<s> She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
<s> Yeah.  Sit down a second.  There's something I need to tell you about Steven...
<s> I mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call?
<s> Have a good night.
<s> Yeah...
<s> What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
<s> The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
<s> -- Bad?!
<s> No -- she left me!  After her miscarriage, I --
<s> Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
<s> I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
<s> There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake...if you believe the stories.  Let's drop it, okay?
<s> We have to get off this ship!!
<s> Nothing.
<s> Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
<s> She didn't push me into coming.
<s> I'm staying.
<s> That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about?
<s> Have you seen my dog anywhere?
<s> There's something I haven't told you...
<s> I gathered that.
<s> It's not that simple.
<s> What is your location?
<s> The LORAN has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude. Give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can.
<s> We changed our minds.
<s> I want to go home. I want off this ship.
<s> Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.
<s> The window...
<s> I'm not!!
<s> Where you're going, mister?
<s> Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
<s> This is a great young out-of-work actress.
<s> I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
<s> Here we go.
<s> Where is it?
<s> No, we're not.
<s> It's your best play, Nicky.
<s> He'll kill it. He'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief. What happens to your apartment on the East River? Your house in Connecticut, where you watch things grow.
<s> This could be it.
<s> Can he get through it?
<s> Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
<s> We don't even like each other, do we?
<s> It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
<s> Why do you need a radio?
<s> A flat-out hit.
<s> We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
<s> Mystery. Deception.
<s> What's sexy?
<s> Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
<s> I'd forgotten that.
<s> I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
<s> What did it say?
<s> This could be it!
<s> But the son is suppose to stop crying.
<s> Since when did that matter?
<s> Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
<s> I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
<s> Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
<s> Why do you care?
<s> Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
<s> Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts.
<s> Sidney.
<s> I have excellent long-term memory.
<s> What color?
<s> Burnt sienna.
<s> Someone waiting for you?
<s> I haven't come to you.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
<s> Eleven.
<s> It does. We must be getting old, Charlie.
<s> Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
<s> That's right. The word only means "community." But it could stand for "village"... or the world.
<s> It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing.
<s> You should ride the pony. It is not necessary to walk to prove the point.
<s> I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop.
<s> Not true!  The secret is mastering the urge.
<s> I can. But I risk being kicked into the gutter by someone less "holy" than Mr. Baker.
<s> If you did this, no one could control it. No one.
<s> ...an eye for an eye making the whole world blind.
<s> A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
<s> Often.
<s> Wrong color.  It's silver.  It's not easy living up to this.
<s> Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
<s> You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
<s> I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.
<s> Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
<s> Michael's.
<s> You may as well invite her here.
<s> I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
<s> In case you get back before I do.
<s> I'm travelling too.
<s> We would like Vincent to have a brother... you know, to play with.
<s> They are not babies, Maria, merely "human possibilities".
<s> Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
<s> You'll be next.
<s> You've never been here?  Let me order for you.
<s> Those checks take forever.
<s> We'll get it later.  Irene, please.
<s> They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.
<s> I heard about you. You work with Miller.
<s> They will be ready. You guys do your job.
<s> Stay clean.
<s> And you got him...
<s> Hi.
<s> Small town, small bank, big money.
<s> Whisky and a peach.
<s> Just the way I remembered.
<s> It's all right.
<s> You were asleep.
<s> I couldn't have... much longer.
<s> I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
<s> But sometimes I cried a lot too.
<s> My mind's not on guessing games.
<s> If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
<s> At least you were outside.
<s> He might be ready to chop us up.
<s> I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
<s> If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
<s> What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
<s> I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
<s> You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you, Doc?  If I was caught, wouldn't you?
<s> I think so... I don't know.
<s> We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
<s> You want to try with me?
<s> You and me.
<s> Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
<s> Two boxes of double-ought buck.
<s> What about you?
<s> Okay. How many bank exits?
<s> It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
<s> He took the day off.
<s> 'Bout five thousand.
<s> I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
<s> After you come back I'll listen while you make some phone calls, tell a few friends you've got to leave for a week or two... You have to call another Vet about the animals. You tell him to come over and take good care of them starting tomorrow... no slip-ups on that. They got to be looked after...
<s> When did you find out?
<s> And you told Brumby?
<s> Was the steering faulty?
<s> What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
<s> Yes. I can't help the way I am.
<s> It's the truth.
<s> No, do you really?
<s> Go on.
<s> Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
<s> Brumby.
<s> Shouldn't think so.
<s> Your brother? What you talking about?
<s> Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
<s> Working at Woolworths.
<s> At me friend's house.
<s> Wilton Estate.
<s> Why would it?
<s> Today? At the races. He always goes.
<s> How many?
<s> I see.
<s> Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
<s> Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.
<s> You're lucky. They kill as well.
<s> Pension him off.
<s> What am I supposed to do?  I don't know where they've taken him. Do you?
<s> What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
<s> Still got your sense of humour.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I have to. Things to see to.
<s> Ha.
<s> That's right.
<s> No.
<s> I'm not?
<s> I had to.
<s> I heard that they were running cold.
<s> What?
<s> That's what I...
<s> Men come work for you...
<s> What?
<s> No, we're just...
<s> Well.  Well...
<s> He would take you on.  Yes.
<s> What?
<s> Yes.
<s> What does that mean?
<s> Why would I do it?
<s> Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
<s> So I'm making it concrete.
<s> What do you care...?
<s> I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.
<s> What?  You can't do any what?
<s> Huh?
<s> They're ancient.
<s> That's...
<s> They stole the...
<s> They stole the phones.
<s> ...what am I going to do all month...
<s> Yes.  The cops.  No.
<s> No.
<s> Why?  Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."
<s> Where was I?
<s> I was at home, where were you?
<s> No.
<s> Why?
<s> Fuck.  I had them on River Glen.
<s> I'm sure that we're insured, George... 
<s> 'Cause, you know, 'cause they weren't, I know that Mitch and Murray uh...
<s> Go to lunch, George.
<s> ...did they...
<s> ...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.
<s> What two?
<s> ...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...
<s> Will you please wait a second. Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me: the hot leads...
<s> The leads are assigned randomly...
<s> You start closing again, you'll be on the board.
<s> And fifty bucks a lead.
<s> I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...
<s> You want something off the B list?
<s> What does that fucking mean?
<s> Yes.  Mmm.  Yes.  Precisely. Precisely. 'Cause your partner depends on it.  I'm talking to you, I'm trying to tell you something.
<s> What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.
<s> You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
<s> What?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Mmm.
<s> I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.
<s> No, I don't think so, Shel.
<s> What sales?
<s> Call up the bank.  I called them.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Guess who?
<s> "You have to believe in yourself... you"--look--"alright...?"
<s> "I want to tell you something, Harriet..."
<s> From the store.
<s> Like you taught me...
<s> ...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
<s> He's right, Williamson.
<s> The hell with him.  We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...
<s> No, Mr. Roma.  I don't need the time, I've made a lot of investments in the last...
<s> Beautiful.  Beautiful rolling land. I was telling Jim and Jinny, Ray, I want to tell you something.  You, Ray, you eat in a lot of restaurants.  I know you do... 
<s> Sure.
<s> Uh...
<s> Home cooking...
<s> I'm coming, Ray...what a day!  I'll call you this evening, Jim.  I'm sorry you had to come in...Monday, lunch.
<s> Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...
<s> I don't know.
<s> I've got to get Ray to O'Hare...  Come on, let's hustle...  John!  Call American Express in Pittsburgh for Mr. Morton, will you, tell them he's on the one o'clock. 
<s> Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
<s> That's what they are.  Three business...I wait till Monday, my time limit runs out.
<s> Yest...
<s> Tell me again.  Your wife.
<s> We're going to speak to her.
<s> Where are you going...?  This is me...This is Ricky, Jim.  Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it.  You understand?  This is me.  Something upset you.  Sit down, now sit down.  You tell me what it is.  Am I going to help you fix it? You're goddamned right I am.  Sit down.  Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside.  It's...no, sit down...Now talk to me.
<s> I...
<s> What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
<s> Yeah.  He closed a deal.
<s> You did that?
<s> Who said "Fuck the Machine"?
<s> I'm giving you three leads.  You...
<s> Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
<s> It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk...
<s> Your check as cashed yesterday afternoon.  And we're completely insured, as you know, in any case.
<s> I got lots of presents.
<s> No, where is it?
<s> That's right.
<s> At first, like everybody, I was a soldier.
<s> I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late.  This is for my Mama.  You remember Merle?
<s> I'm not afraid of his words.
<s> He will grow strong.
<s> I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
<s> Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers.  Didn't you know that?
<s> I want you to help me, Fredo.
<s> I never looked down on you, Fredo. You don't look down at a brother.
<s> You know otherwise, Freddie?
<s> ...Who?
<s> What about now, is there anything you can help me out with?
<s> There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
<s> Chi?
<s> I'm going to see my parents.
<s> If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
<s> We don't know that's true, he never said that.
<s> I can't let him down.
<s> But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don't think...
<s> Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
<s> No.  But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.
<s> Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
<s> That plane goes to Miami...
<s> Tom, what do I do now?
<s> Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.
<s> Do you owe markers?
<s> Very well.
<s> The witness is excused; take him out.
<s> Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay. Please tell the Senator I won't be a minute.
<s> Yes, Michael.
<s> Sleeping inside me.
<s> I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
<s> Goodbye, Michael.
<s> Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
<s> You haven't heard me.
<s> The baby I lost...
<s> Who do you think you're talking to?
<s> You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
<s> You talk about the baby.  She can have another baby.
<s> Yes.
<s> I saw an interesting thing today. A man was being arrested by the Military Police; probably an urban guerrilla.  Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket, taking the command vehicle with him.
<s> I wouldn't consider anyone else.
<s> Still no word of your courier? We'll find him.  But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come.
<s> No, I'm fine.
<s> No.
<s> That is a complete falsehood.
<s> I do not.
<s> You were unfair with them.
<s> Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
<s> In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.
<s> It would be the beginning of the end for my family.  How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?
<s> And?
<s> You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
<s> What about Michael Corleone?
<s> Like hell!  And who the hell are you to give me orders.  Watch your manners or you'll be on your Sicilian ass in the street there.
<s> Just thinking out loud.
<s> Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
<s> Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.
<s> Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
<s> You mean us?
<s> Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
<s> I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
<s> That's okay, Hanna.  I'm more comfortable in here.  It is Hanna, isn't it?
<s> No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
<s> He is dead now, twenty years.
<s> No.  His is the worse.  The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame?
<s> Mornin'.
<s> Boone.  Clayton Boone.
<s> Yeah.  I better get on with my work.
<s> Broke is more like it.
<s> You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
<s> I'm not wearing an undershirt.
<s> But it's just my face you want to draw.
<s> No.  I'm fine.
<s> We weren't rich.  But we weren't poor either.
<s> This David's a friend?
<s> Of course.  I had to make it interesting for myself, you see.  A comedy about death.  The trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke.  But the Monster never receives any of my gibes.  He is noble.  Noble and misunderstood.
<s> You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
<s> I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.
<s> Of course.  I don't want to scare you off.  Not before I'm finished with you.
<s> Not at the moment.
<s> The world is just one kiss-ass game after another.  A man has to make up his own life, alone.
<s> You've done a helluva lot more than most people.
<s> How long were you...?
<s> You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
<s> You're talking through your hat now.
<s> You were a soldier?
<s> I didn't --
<s> I don't get it.  First you creep me out with homo shit.  Then you hit me with war stories.  And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want?
<s> You don't want me to sit for you anymore?
<s> Never gave it much thought.
<s> "A perfect night for mystery and horror.  The air itself is filled with monsters."
<s> Your friend?
<s> What won't do?
<s> What did you expect?  Bronze?
<s> Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
<s> No, I don't want to die alone.  But to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable.  They say you never see the one with your name on it.  But I want to see death coming at me.  I want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face.  Your face.  Think, Clayton.  You'd be my second Monster.  Almost as famous as the first.  It would be the great adventure you've yearned for. A war story for both of us to share.
<s> Pray you, undo this button.
<s> Hasta la vista, Boone.  And give the jail bait a squeeze for me.
<s> Good.  Fine.
<s> I thought I'd give you a hand since I kept you open.
<s> Thank you.
<s> You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
<s> Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
<s> More your line.
<s> Yes?
<s> A visitor.
<s> I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
<s> Everything.  Start at the beginning.
<s> Your father was a schoolmaster?
<s> I don't mind.
<s> Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
<s> He's one of the great images of the twentieth century.  As important as the Mona Lisa.
<s> I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.
<s> Bet you thought you'd never see me again.  I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
<s> Six years ...
<s> The point is: Kip's been living the life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy. Makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time. But he fungold this one so bad, folks around L.B. are already speakin' about him in the past tense.
<s> Who do you think?
<s> Jesus ...
<s> This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?
<s> A little family emergency --
<s> No...
<s> Kip.
<s> Consider me gone, Detective --
<s> Double-meaning intended --
<s> Cadillac.
<s> The other day....
<s> Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
<s> That's right. Only 10 exotics ...
<s> I know. Weird, huh -- ?
<s> He didn't mess up. There it is ...
<s> Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...
<s> Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. I don't know what you remember of him. But you should brace yourself
<s> I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
<s> You've been pre-booked...
<s> "Carol." A 198 Mercedes ... She lives in the suburbs ...
<s> It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...
<s> Damn crooks is everywhere --
<s> Don't go there, Toby --
<s> Hello, Memphis --
<s> Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
<s> About what?
<s> Hey, now -
<s> Me...
<s> You spread it out, by the 2nd night, the heat are onto you. Know something's up. With a one-night boost, by the time all the cars are reported stolen, your ship's set sail.
<s> Thank-you ...
<s> Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
<s> Price of doing business...
<s> It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows, Memphis.  You know that. Doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down, the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain't that a small price to pay for never, never-ever, having to say "paper or plastic?"
<s> Hell, yeah... It's a beautiful business ...  I mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary, it sucks ...
<s> What?
<s> Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done. I've never actually paid for a car. I want to see what it feels like
<s> Call 'em here -- ?
<s> Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
<s> Yeah, well ... She lives with District Court Judge Seymour Croft ...
<s> I put the boys on it. They're clever that way...
<s> That what you want?
<s> Okay.
<s> I always thought you'd follow me up.
<s> I think so... They're just... So ...
<s> I take out my slim-jim...
<s> Cut 'em...
<s> And Tracy's on the move ...
<s> Yeah ... You -- ?
<s> Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
<s> Are you considering a comeback tour?
<s> Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up
<s> So she flies -
<s> Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --
<s> Shit all looks the same here --
<s> The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
<s> The guy from near where Christie used to live?
<s> I've been all fucked up since I got out.
<s> She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes.  I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.
<s> He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.
<s> Are you nuts?  Jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she's such a pain in the ass. Let me tell you. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. They do stuff with the wrong people. They don't have things organized. You know who goes to jail? Nigger stickup men. That's who. And they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car.
<s> The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?
<s> Shit You know they would have never found it. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? My God, why did you have to do it?
<s> I got scared.
<s> My father got a letter from the school. He said the next time he'll kill me.
<s> There's a shovel at my mother's.
<s> Jimmy.  I don't know.  I got so much else on my mind.  I got the kids.  We got no money.
<s> He's with his friends.
<s> Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?
<s> What? Come on!
<s> Fuck you, you fat fuck.
<s> What do I look like, Al Cowlins?  You want to take my car, drop her off?
<s> Week after I'm twenty-one.
<s> Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
<s> So, you ladies ah, go to school here?
<s> Well, I don't have no trousers on...
<s> And so they go around to the front of his truck...and there's another cat on the grille.
<s> I'm serious Chuckie, I ain't goin'.
<s> Yah, that was different. Management was restructurin'--
<s> The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.
<s> Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.
<s> I have about seventy-three...
<s> Good, it was all right.
<s> Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms--
<s> Yeah, can I help you?
<s> No students work for me.
<s> Hey fuck you.
<s> Really?
<s> That's right.
<s> Of course.
<s> The least you can do is show me a little appreciation.
<s> No, that's fine, Will. I was just leaving.
<s> I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
<s> I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.
<s> Find out what?
<s> Yeah, cured polio.
<s> Just meet with the boy once a week.
<s> It's on the college.
<s> Who?
<s> --Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
<s> Hold on!
<s> --I'm not angry at you--
<s> That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
<s> Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
<s> I don't know. India maybe.
<s> You should come. I'll buy you a drink.
<s> Sounds good.
<s> You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
<s> Have you read all these books, Will?
<s> I did.
<s> You think so?
<s> You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
<s> 285.
<s> This is a real piece of shit.
<s> The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.
<s> You ever think about gettin' remarried?
<s> I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
<s> Yeah.
<s> October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.
<s> You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room.
<s> Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
<s> That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!
<s> No.  Have you had any experience with that?
<s> It's not your fault.
<s> It's not your fault.
<s> Yeah, I figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
<s> We'll do that.
<s> Not tonight.
<s> It's important that I learn this.
<s> I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?
<s> So, do you play the piano?
<s> --But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
<s> What am I scared of?
<s> --some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
<s> You don't want to hear that I got cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid. That this isn't surgery
<s> Well, I'm contracting the land.
<s> You trying to tell me how to run my own business?
<s> Listen, Smart Guy. I'll run my business my own way. I got work. If you wanta take it, okay. If not, just sit here, that's all.
<s> I never knowed they was anything like her!
<s> Be glad to get my han' on some cotton. That's the kin' a pickin' I understan'.
<s> Don't hold me so tight.
<s> People done it. If they could, we could.
<s> Fan-belt's shot.
<s> Okay. Go on.
<s> Joad.
<s> Why, I guess so.
<s> An' you say no cops?
<s> Say, who runs this place?
<s> Ma's shore gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long time.
<s> Crate fell on me.
<s> Yeah. On my way home now.
<s> I been in the penitentiary for four years. 
<s> Shore it is. It always is, this time a year.
<s> They never wrote you nothing?
<s> You're right!
<s> No, but--but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don't pay nothin'. Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're a radio expert--nice clean work.
<s> Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
<s> Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
<s> Five they're a-gettin' now, an' that's all they're int'rested in. I know exackly what Pa'd say. He'd jus' say it wasn't none a his business.
<s> Hush!
<s> And I ain't gonna listen either. I tol' you what I'm gonna do.  And I don't give a hoot in a hollow if they's oranges and grapes crowdin' a fella outa bed even, I ain't a- goin' to California!  This here's my country. I b'long *here*.  It ain't no good--  --but it's mine.
<s> Ain't a-goin', thas all...
<s> 'S all right, Grampa. You just kind a tar'd, that's all. Somebody fix a pallet.
<s> Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?
<s> They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it.
<s> Go get Tom an' Al.  I dunno what to do. I got to feed the fambly. What'm I gonna do with these here?
<s> We *got* to, Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy.  Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?
<s> Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son 
<s> That's right. And douse some in it.
<s> Ya say we're acrost?
<s> Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me.
<s> You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.
<s> Okay, Ma. I shouldn't, though. I know I shouldn't. But okay.
<s> I don't understan' it, Tom.
<s> Good-by, Tommy.
<s> I know, ma'am... on'y it's for a ole lady, no teeth, gotta sof'n it with water so she can chew it, an' she's hongry.
<s> But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
<s> I shore would like to stop here a while an' give her some res' but we on'y got 'bout forty dollars left. I won't feel right till we're there an' all workin' an' a little money comin' in.
<s> I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
<s> We can pick anything.
<s> Ain't gonna be no trouble.
<s> Don't say that.
<s> What?
<s> What?
<s> Insane.
<s> You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
<s> It's nice to see you again.
<s> Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
<s> Okay.
<s> You see someone?
<s> Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
<s> Yep.
<s> Bad television.
<s> This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
<s> As long as I get the laugh.
<s> Wow. I have to give this some thought.
<s> That's probably a good idea.
<s> Okay.
<s> We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
<s> Hard to get good help these days.
<s> Hello Martin. How have you been?
<s> That sounds pretty interesting...
<s> Those all seem kind of related...
<s> We can't do our job unless he does his job.
<s> No...
<s> All of it?
<s> He didn't.
<s> Tell them my house exploded.
<s> Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great.
<s> Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
<s> I think I'll go see Debi today.
<s> That's too bad.
<s> Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
<s> Well, that'll be a little complicated --
<s> It is cocktail hour yet?
<s> Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron.
<s> Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.
<s> Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
<s> I thought you were an editor, not a reporter?
<s> Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse.  Good... You have a nice seat.
<s> You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
<s> She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
<s> Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
<s> I am comfortable.
<s> Ssshhh...  Stand still, Annie. Takes what we've got, just for now. Can you do that?
<s> Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all.
<s> Fine!
<s> What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it!
<s> You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
<s> Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?
<s> Well, one was for salad...
<s> I'll take care of it.
<s> Did you go riding?
<s> I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
<s> Tom?
<s> My period.
<s> Did you speak to Farlow?
<s> I should be in by two.
<s> No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
<s> No, let me go.
<s> Doing what?
<s> I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
<s> I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
<s> Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.
<s> Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
<s> Okay.
<s> Everything all right.
<s> Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
<s> No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right.
<s> Take your time.
<s> No. He had the choice.
<s> Either fight the way things are or accept it.
<s> It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel.
<s> She calls him Tommy...
<s> I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for.  Between you and me, I could use the time alone.
<s> You too, Diane.
<s> What?
<s> Uh, I'm Tom Booker. Your mother around?
<s> Not like books or literature or anything. Just a magazine... Just in case she hasn't told you -- which I'm sure she hasn't -- I don't want to be a part of this, OK?
<s> Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.
<s> No, not yet.
<s> No, I'm just not that hungry.
<s> NO!
<s> I did. He said he had work to do until late.
<s> You're the one who's stupid -- letting her go and fall off your horse!!
<s> Oh yeah...
<s> Sometimes.
<s> Now that's cool.
<s> Alright sir.
<s> Hackers of the World, Unite!
<s> Super hero like even.
<s> That's far out!
<s> Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the Da Vinci virus?
<s> It was him, man!
<s> Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
<s> And unpack.
<s> Fucked if I care, man.
<s> Joey's getting stupid busy.
<s> Think you can do better?
<s> I said give me time.
<s> I'm sorry, I can't.
<s> Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
<s> I got a record. I was Zero Cool.
<s> You would have looked better.
<s> Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.  Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?
<s> Homicidal?
<s> Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from...
<s> Hey, it's me.
<s> A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.
<s> Yeah.  Should be on the road.
<s> Real charmer.
<s> So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
<s> We've been better.
<s> Not without Jamie.
<s> I don't know!
<s> Look, even if by some miracle Michael is conscience, his muscles would be totally useless.  Give the troopers a chance to search.
<s> Its not exactly the end of the world, for goodness sake
<s> You guys always look great.
<s> Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
<s> Susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink  Rachel?
<s> Outside.
<s> Sure ain't. Martians could land on Ben's doorstep, all he'd do is spit once and get himself a shot gun.
<s> Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers.
<s> It was the nightmare man
<s> Yeah, hurry up.
<s> I can't.
<s> I've got you come on, go down.
<s> All right.
<s> Don't you mean what you do best?
<s> Jamie?
<s> Its not over yet.
<s> Right here, Ben.
<s> 10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter.
<s> All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
<s> All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.
<s> Evil.
<s> Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
<s> Yes. Michael Myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs.
<s> Car trouble?
<s> Hi, Dad. What happened?
<s> I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
<s> I wasn't spooked.
<s> What's this big, big news?
<s> Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
<s> Annie!
<s> He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.
<s> He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so.
<s> Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
<s> ...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
<s> Promise?
<s> Could have...
<s> You all right?
<s> You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
<s> As usual, I don't have anything to do.
<s> Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of the sixth grade.
<s> I don't like that story.
<s> I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him...
<s> I promise.
<s> I saw him...
<s> He was doing all right last night. Maybe somebody around here gave him lessons.
<s> What did you use before?
<s> I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
<s> The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...
<s> Mmm?
<s> Well, let's do it.
<s> Oh, is that what it is?
<s> Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
<s> I know.  I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.
<s> Right.
<s> What makes you think we're more interesting?
<s> What time do you get off?
<s> It's terrific!
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Let's take a look.
<s> No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me.
<s> Like what?
<s> I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
<s> Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
<s> Hi.
<s> We nev-- We don't name names!  We say the Pope.
<s> ...cannot go on the air.
<s> No, I don't have time.
<s> Yes?
<s> Oh, yes.  Who doesn't?  Look!
<s> Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
<s> No, I don't think so.
<s> Well, sure.
<s> Oh, that's nice.  I'd love to see her wind up settled.  She's a tense one. 
<s> Oh, don't say those words!
<s> Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
<s> I know it isn't.
<s> Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
<s> I know.
<s> Let's go have dinner, shall we?
<s> I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
<s> Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
<s> I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take.
<s> Are you in love with someone else?
<s> No.
<s> Yeah.
<s> No, thank you.
<s> ...you're such a puzzle.  So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else. 
<s> Based on what?  You never even see him.
<s> I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
<s> No.
<s> I'm saying it now!
<s> Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
<s> But not you.
<s> Don't say that!  I don't want to hear that word!  Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
<s> Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind...
<s> I think they're fantastic.
<s> He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test. 
<s> Oh, me, I'm okay.
<s> How are you?
<s> You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.
<s> Oh...
<s> You are, Holly.  Stop it.
<s> I'm-I'm okay.  Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden.  I'm-I'm...I have a headache.
<s> I got two minutes.
<s> Here, you guys.  Open them up.
<s> I think he'll find that satisfying.
<s> I think so.
<s> H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
<s> Wow!
<s> W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
<s> Oh, your kids are so adorable.
<s> Well, how about this?
<s> Singing?
<s> Hmm!
<s> No, not "Oh, so loosely"!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?
<s> Can I, can I not accept gestures and feelings from people?  Do I, do I put people off?
<s> Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things?  How?  They're private!
<s> No!
<s> How are you?
<s> Well, I hope you've changed.
<s> You've always hated my taste in the past.
<s> I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
<s> Oh, well.
<s> Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
<s> It was just great.  Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff.
<s> Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous.
<s> Hmm.
<s> Take our literature...
<s> ...I was <u>working</u>...
<s> Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
<s> I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
<s> Rich, comic book freaks.
<s> Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
<s> COULD I GET A <u>DRINK</u>,  N'I don't <u>care</u>, you see, what all they got me doin, for I'd rather be doin' <u>makework</u>, than be doin' <u>pub'l'relations</u> with THE DIRTY DOZEN, one <u>Hispanic</u>, one <u>Librarian</u>, one <u>Jew</u>, and One from Column A, and One from Column...  Thank you.
<s> I'm not.
<s> ...the whole world's out to get you...
<s> I know her by the Back.
<s> He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
<s> They got that kind of money?
<s> Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
<s> Impossible.
<s> Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....
<s> ...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
<s> Have the child taken to bed.
<s> The children...?
<s> I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  To his appearance.
<s> You said the <u>bad</u> news...
<s> Come on, Doctor, <u>then</u> you can sleep...
<s> Let the girl go.
<s> ...standard issue...
<s> A wonderful country...
<s> I have had many excellent meals there.
<s> ...should love to correct your error. 
<s> And how good of <u>you</u> to remember it. Then, this trip, then, is not a return to <u>America</u>...
<s> You have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
<s> You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
<s> Why did you look at me that way?
<s> How so?
<s> ...you have <u>brought</u> this perfume... brought this perfume.  Back.  <u>Back</u> from America.  To your New Wife...  You have given it to her, and some of...  Some of 'her perfume' has found its way back onto you.  Lucky man.  Lucky man, indeed.
<s> We got KittyKat...
<s> Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
<s> Thank you.  No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad you <u>find</u> me so..."
<s> Thanks to <u>you</u>...
<s> I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
<s> ...but will that satisfy you?
<s> Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the <u>only</u> crime.  <u>I</u> never ceased to hope!
<s> ...after you' re dead.  AND WHEN I GIVE THE WORD, do you understand...when I give the <u>word</u>...
<s> ...what has she done to harm you...?
<s> Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
<s> You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your <u>mind</u> cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step <u>slow</u>...
<s> Do you think you could make a cup of coffee, cause I'm going to work.
<s> They aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
<s> ...and that is what you need to expand.
<s> We are here on sufferance.  I am here...
<s> Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>... 
<s> ...a case, so, so <u>fascinating</u>, so...
<s> Dottore Fanelli...
<s> I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
<s> ...yes, yes, yes....
<s> How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?" 
<s> That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it.
<s> Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.
<s> You have no idea. Now run away.
<s> That's good. I wouldn't have wanted to embarrass myself.
<s> I'm not really a--Does it count if...
<s> Uh, yeah, that's...wow.
<s> Man, it's not like I don't know about women. I had this babysitter...
<s> Eric...You can't be like me. You have to be better. I'm not the guy you think I am...
<s> You guys have been so colossal...
<s> Your Secret admirer?
<s> "or you're going to get it?" Wow, first week of camp. Promise me you won't try moving so fast with Wichita.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Yeah. And?
<s> Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...
<s> Yes you do.
<s> Stop!  Stop it, this afternoon was not what you thought...I overheard you and Pixel, at the side of the mess hall, your idea about the "test"...Do you believe me?
<s> What are you doing, Wendy?  What's in that cup?
<s> That's okay. Your Mom said you had a big date. Heck, I'd probably skip my own birthday party for a date.
<s> Hey really, I don't feel so great.
<s> Save the speeches for Malcom X. I just wanna get laid.
<s> All right.
<s> So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
<s> Heather? Wha...
<s> Give it up girl!
<s> Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
<s> Maybe it's time for a vacation.
<s> But before that, I'd like to see Heather Chandler puke her guts out.
<s> Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue.
<s> Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.
<s> It's one thing to want somebody out of your life. It's another thing to serve them a wake-up cup of Drano.
<s> This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
<s> Next channel, darling.
<s> Yeah. Scary stuff.
<s> My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
<s> I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.
<s> Get crucial. We won't be using blanks this time.
<s> Incredible similarity.
<s> Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi?
<s> Wha-at? Come on, there's another T.V. in the kitchen. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
<s> No-o!
<s> I thought I...you..
<s> Heather was cool, but cruel. The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness.
<s> Get a job.
<s> Sure. Ciao.
<s> Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
<s> Is it hurting, dear?
<s> I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
<s> pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.
<s> But she'll have no one to look after her!
<s> grabs Pauline by the shoulders.
<s> I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
<s> is very angry.
<s> and HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles at Juliet.
<s> hurries over.
<s> I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
<s> Thank you. I bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper.
<s> Mummy!
<s> He . . .
<s> God, yes!
<s> You're such an incredible woman.
<s> Your insight is enlightening.
<s> Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.
<s> You need to get better first Trevor. Way better.  It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to still love someone after they're gone. But you've got to quit blaming yourself okay...? Okay?
<s> Bull...
<s> Okay so... what's the safest place?
<s> Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
<s> Yeah, how's that?
<s> But... I thought...
<s> There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan 
<s> For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.
<s> It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.
<s> I don't work here.
<s> Two.
<s> This game is over do you hear me?
<s> Shh. It's okay son. There is but one truth. One thing you can be absolutely sure of. And that thing is this:
<s> Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you, forget. You've got to get this fuckin pain to stop.
<s> I don't even know what's real and what isn't how can I trust anyone?
<s> I surrender...
<s> Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
<s> Well now there's a compliment.
<s> One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
<s> They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
<s> I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks...
<s> Lighten up, John.  You think <u>you</u> got problems for Chrissake?
<s> What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy.
<s> You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?
<s> On the deposition for the jUdge, Bernie... I mean there's no way I can promise anything.  I can't tell him what we're up to...
<s> How recently?
<s> I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job.  You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.
<s> Some of it.  Right here.  I got some of it.  I'll get the rest as soon as I can.
<s> Twenty-five grand is peanuts!  All you gotta do is get me outta here long enough to collect.
<s> Well, as you like to point out, Mister LaPlante, I'm relatively inexperienced.  My naivete may have worked to your benefit in this instance.
<s> THAT'S IT!  YOU TALKED!  YOU'RE FIRED!  OUTTA HERE!  GET OUTTA HERE!
<s> Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --
<s> Maybe not,... but you let him believe it!  And then I gotta explain about the homeless...
<s> How not all of them own apartment complexes, how not all of them play the stock market, how not all of them rent babies when they're panhandling.  He's ten years old, Bernie!  Impressionable!
<s> Me!
<s> A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
<s> "The Nomm"?  What's that?
<s> I could go to a movie Thursday night.  'Cause we don't have school on Friday.
<s> You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....
<s> Vietnam!
<s> You're lucky, Chucky, you... OW!
<s> The...Silver...Mike...Award!
<s> Unprofessional.
<s> If you reach out, you could get pulled over yourself.
<s> She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
<s> Said he's not an actor.
<s> Never reach out!
<s> We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd like to find --
<s> I wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, Mister Winston...
<s> Call him back.  Ask him.  I'm a little...busy.
<s> Who?
<s> How are they with kids?
<s> Well, it's for a woman.
<s> Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing.
<s> Yeah, since I was a kid.  I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time.  Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --
<s> Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
<s> Who doesn't?
<s> It's not going to happen unless you make it happen, my friend. You're going to have to assert yourself a little bit more.  <u>Show</u> your affection.
<s> Maybe I could take a look at it now.
<s> It's a living.
<s> Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world.  I don't like having to rely on other people.
<s> Yeah, I'm okay -- it's been a long night.
<s> About us.
<s> Why are you mad at each other?
<s> Did Daddy tease you?
<s> Holly -- that's not so.
<s> It's okay, baby, the police are coming.
<s> I can't help it if my homework is torn to shreds three times a week by someone <u>much</u> bigger than me</u>.
<s> The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?
<s> Huh?
<s> Oh -- great.
<s> Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
<s> Philip!  The senior partner?
<s> This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
<s> We'll talk in the morning.
<s> Shut up.
<s> What for, dickweed?
<s> No.
<s> It's a double.
<s> Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.
<s> I learned my fill from Romeriz.
<s> Perhaps -- but if I must face it, let it find me, for I shall search for it no more.
<s> That's all?
<s> And what do you think you will find in another land?
<s> For what?
<s> We cannot write our destiny, Macleod. In the end it could be you and me.
<s> The sea and I don't agree with each other.  Where we off to?
<s> It's done.
<s> I think you just like to eat dirt.
<s> Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?
<s> No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..
<s> Are you a cop?
<s> Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
<s> You remind me of someone I used to know.
<s> About what?
<s> I'm interested in mythology.
<s> You're twenty minutes late.
<s> I know.
<s> --the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
<s> Conner?
<s> Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
<s> How could they get by him?
<s> I can take care of myself.
<s> Aye -- that I would, lass.
<s> It's not for me to decide.
<s> Yes.
<s> I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
<s> No.  The money, please.
<s> That would be the girl who opened the door.  Are the others inside?
<s> Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?
<s> It was stolen.
<s> Yes, sir.  But what about the disks?  If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.
<s> <u>Fuck</u> them!  Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this.
<s> I have contacts in Los Angeles.  Lawyers and judges who can help you.
<s> Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
<s> Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
<s> We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
<s> Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
<s> Jesus, first Mars, now you.  You two need anti-depressants.
<s> I'm not going to die for this!
<s> I'm here.
<s> Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
<s> Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
<s> There's a million dollars in there, maybe <u>two</u> million.  I'll give you half.
<s> Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
<s> It won't be a problem.
<s> I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.
<s> That big asshole nailed my windows.
<s> Go!  If you get out, maybe you can help the police!
<s> I don't drink beer.
<s> We can't make the microwave work.
<s> Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
<s> We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
<s> His cell number belongs to the Smiths.  I think it's real, Chief.  I think this boy is inside that house.
<s> Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.
<s> You have her cell number?
<s> Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
<s> Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
<s> Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
<s> Special Agent Jones.
<s> They've been in there all day.
<s> I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
<s> Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
<s> These disks . . . where are they?
<s> What do you mean by that?
<s> I'm sorry, it's a private function.
<s> They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.
<s> Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.
<s> That's what I came to talk to you about.
<s> I'll be back.
<s> Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
<s> You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju.
<s> What's happening?
<s> Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
<s> Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the smartest man here. You have them all eating out of your hand. You'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing.
<s> Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
<s> The high command? Our high command?
<s> Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.
<s> No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.
<s> No, sir.
<s> I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
<s> Politics is power, Paul. And money.
<s> Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead.
<s> Give me the phone.
<s> Gregoire, what are you doing here?
<s> No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this.
<s> No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe.
<s> The third floor are low class rooms.
<s> They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance.
<s> We must do something.
<s> What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
<s> But who is left?
<s> What sort of car?
<s> Get on the truck, Tatiana.
<s> You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.
<s> Many times.
<s> Boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know I'm Tutsi.
<s> -- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
<s> -- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
<s> More to the point. Where's our host?
<s> -- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
<s> Yeah...something.
<s> -- the "Saturation Chamber." Where he wanted to put me.
<s> I got an engraved -- literally -- invitation -- with my name --
<s> Is she alright?
<s> -- she's not dead! Just have to get her heart pumping aqain!
<s> I lied. The House is alive and we're all gonna die.
<s> The Soul of the House. Everything that's corrupt about it... My father trapped it in there just before he died. You see, he purchased the house to restore it... We were going to live here... Nothing can live here. I was just a kid... The first time I saw it, I thought it was beautiful... It was just a dark mist turning into the corner of the room... then it started to move... then death started to happen... First the workers.. six in all... then my father...
<s> Up here --
<s> Yeah. But, hey, anybody who's not "comfortable" with the rules, you're free to walk, anytime. Seven digits poorer, goes without saying.
<s> -- yeah, we did that --
<s> I don't think so...
<s> Let's try down here...
<s> It'll have to do.
<s> We're safe?
<s> It's succeeding!
<s> Run.
<s> Jesus!
<s> I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.
<s> Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
<s> Question answered.
<s> Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
<s> No, no, it's just --
<s> And then what happens?
<s> Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
<s> You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you.
<s> Good way to get your head blown off.
<s> I think I'll do what I damn well please.
<s> Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
<s> -- confirming everything we already know --
<s> -- no more --
<s> It better be -- he still owes me $25 grand for renting the place for the night! Here, let's get you some illumination so you can make your way safely!
<s> Why not?
<s> This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...
<s> He would have been back by now.
<s> -- ten.
<s> Over here.
<s> You say you saw some activity here?
<s> The style of dress on the girl... it coincides with the era Marion Foster killed herself.  Who else could have gone in there and done something like that?
<s> Thank you.  If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it.  Do you live around here?
<s> So was I.  The usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> I didn't do anything, mommy.
<s> Maybe it was Colleen...
<s> We're going to go someplace new.
<s> Where is she?
<s> Don't be afraid!
<s> Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...
<s> Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
<s> The place is pretty dusty.
<s> Aubrey knows more about us than you think.
<s> Or what she was worth.
<s> She has a...friend.  Colleen.
<s> You, an imaginary friend.  That's what she calls her.
<s> Aubrey!
<s> Ok...
<s> She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
<s> Yeah, they told us this was the best.
<s> Did you know her very well?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Hopefully the whole sad chapter is over.  And everyone, including your family, will find peace. WILL I just want to...thank all of you, for everything you've done for us.
<s> What are you getting at!
<s> Not really.  Oh, wait a minute.
<s> It was nailed to the cellar wall.
<s> I know what I saw.
<s> Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
<s> And what is ... this frozen moment?
<s> The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
<s> Right.
<s> What is it?
<s> The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
<s> No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
<s> I don't think so.  But it's a fascinating subject.  Did you ...
<s> It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping.
<s> No.  We want ...
<s> I don't know.  Maybe.
<s> And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
<s> Right.  Like you were hog-tied or something.
<s> Good.  So did I.  And that's all ...
<s> Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
<s> Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
<s> Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
<s> Terri, listen.       Why don't you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it going to happen?  Let's get it out of the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can relax.  Talk.  You know.
<s> I laughed, I cried.
<s> Just means it'll take you an extra 31 seconds to seduce.  You re still the best, I know it.
<s> No need.  Guards' station's right there.
<s> Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...
<s> "Every day you meet quite a few."
<s> Paint a woman in a lighthou--I don't want to steal a horse. Life is...
<s> Why try?
<s> Yes way.
<s> Ooh-kay...
<s> Snickers, make the list happen. Oh and it's one thing to play hide and seek with the Mayflower's pathetic staff, but we're sore losers.  I've put jumper cables on the nipples of children and not always in the line of duty.
<s> A little petting is not the issue!
<s> Sure Hudson.  Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?
<s> And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman.  I'm not taking anything for granted anymore.
<s> I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...
<s> Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.
<s> Holy sh-h--things are going to get very interesting, very fast. Da Vinci would be proud of you.
<s> Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God.  But you're a close second, tough guy.  What is that smile?
<s> When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
<s> If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt.
<s> Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.
<s> If you're pausing for a "thank you," give it up.  So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?
<s> Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown?
<s> You go back, you won't be alone. You'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate.  You're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but "Alex" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. Depressing.
<s> With a little jazz.
<s> The Hudswinger!
<s> What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
<s> Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.
<s> I'm happy enough.
<s> I know they're gonna buy that stock --
<s> You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
<s> I myself --
<s> No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years --
<s> Oh, no, really, I --
<s> ...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?
<s> Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?
<s> Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
<s> Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
<s> I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --
<s> You don't say.
<s> Every year?
<s> Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
<s> That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve...
<s> Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for luck!
<s> Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --
<s> I don't know...
<s> Terrific.
<s> I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
<s> It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
<s> We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker room!
<s> Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
<s> Aw, buddy, I don't care about that.
<s> But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives!
<s> I --
<s> Oh my God, sir!
<s> Oh my God, sir!
<s> Yeah, tell me about it.
<s> She sits down.
<s> I know, miss.  But I like to do it. I like to tend for Miss Jessica and I want to tend for you.  You settle right back, now, and I'll mix you your coffee.
<s> But you didn't have to come up here.
<s> Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
<s> Of course.  It's been nice of you to spend this much time with me.
<s> I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?
<s> By a curious coincidence, it's my day off, too.
<s> Wait. I want to listen.
<s> Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
<s> One of these days he'll start on you, the way he did on her.  "You think life's beautiful, don't you, Jessica?  You think you're beautiful, don't you, Jessica?"  What he could do to that word "beautiful." That's Paul's great weapon -- words.  He uses them the way other men use their fists.
<s> Please, Wes, do as I ask.  You must rest, you must sleep.
<s> You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
<s> Yes, thank you.
<s> I'm not sure I can make you understand.  You know what this is?
<s> She was beautiful.
<s> I am afraid, Wesley, he has that right.  And I will have to urge him to use it.
<s> Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Mr. Holland. But -- as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case.
<s> It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
<s> Up the organization!  Bastard.
<s> So maybe you'll come too?
<s> It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
<s> You want to go?
<s> I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it was... you were, but, you know. I just don't know...
<s> Elena, what are you're talking about?
<s> Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
<s> Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
<s> All right.
<s> Good.
<s> Well, the whole gamut. Facts of life and all. Some fatherly advice, because, I tell you, there's things happening that you're probably old enough... well...  For example, on the self-abuse front -- now this is important - it's not advisable to do it in the shower -- it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any case -- and, um, not onto the linen, and not on your sister's underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother --
<s> Ben--
<s> Jesus all right enough!
<s> What do you think we're doing, dad?
<s> Yeah.
<s> And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
<s> That's besides the point.
<s> Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now --
<s> Nah, that wasn't in the contract.
<s> Yeah. You?
<s> Hi Wendy.
<s> Nobody.
<s> We were just riding around.
<s> Social work?
<s> Educated guess.
<s> Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
<s> Yes, it was -- I ended up --
<s> I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --
<s> All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?
<s> Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
<s> I hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
<s> See ya.
<s> Major.
<s> The Idiot?
<s> Great, thanks for the tip.
<s> Thanks for the advice dad.
<s> It's like very positive, and I feel a real special feeling, because you really --
<s> You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --
<s> I don't have a girlfriend.
<s> Yeah. When it freezes, I guess that means the molecules are not moving. So when you breathe, there's nothing in the air, you know, to breathe in to your body. The molecules have stopped. So it's clean.
<s> Watching what?
<s> Libbets? What kind of a name is Libbets?
<s> Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
<s> Yeah? See ya.
<s> I have to go to the bathroom.
<s> Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop?  A good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing.  A bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him.  You said that once, remember?
<s> We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
<s> Right.  Got lost in the rocks.
<s> I told her to come.
<s> And something else that might interest you.
<s> You know what about.
<s> To do nothing.
<s> Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...
<s> Will?
<s> You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I like it or not...
<s> No.  He didn't say what his name was. Only that you were expecting him.
<s> Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I knew the second I met Dobbs that he was guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had circumstantial evidence, but nothing to tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went over every inch of that apartment.
<s> Huh?
<s> What kind of stuff?
<s> Ran like hell to go to him...
<s> Yes.
<s> Then so was mine...
<s> It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
<s> Ah! You have questions?
<s> You mean we are not children of Satan?
<s> Your lover.
<s> That's what the one who made me said.
<s> Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm.
<s> Louis, put me in my coffin...
<s> Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
<s> Don't mock, Claudia...
<s> And you never cried -
<s> Claudia, you torture yourself.
<s> Yes, and very beautiful.
<s> Yes...
<s> Why should I be?
<s> I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?
<s> Do you think so?
<s> Fascination...
<s> I don't know any hell -
<s> What you wouldn't do. It's almost sunrise. It will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me. The sun or the fire!
<s> Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
<s> Don't worry, Louis, you're conscience is clear. You left her alive.
<s> She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what...
<s> Don't try to speak... it's alright...
<s> You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
<s> So much the better. I've got a pocket full of tapes.
<s> So shall we begin?  What do yo do?
<s> Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.
<s> Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
<s> The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
<s> Fictions, my friend. The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman... So we repaired to Paris...
<s> Yes...
<s> What about a radio?
<s> What the hell would you call this?
<s> Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet?
<s> It's our version of winter.  201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.
<s> No.
<s> That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.
<s> What are you doing in my closet?
<s> Yeah, right -- whatever.
<s> Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
<s> Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.
<s> Julie, you left four messages... Four.
<s> Ray, we're just friend.
<s> Fine. Show me the body.
<s> It's in my room!
<s> Did you get help?
<s> Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.
<s> Hey --
<s> How's Julie?
<s> How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
<s> We'll call you back with all the details...So what's your favorite radio station?
<s> Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too.
<s> I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
<s> Must have missed the sign.
<s> She's in her room.
<s> My friend -- what can one say --
<s> That's impossible. I told them Jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.
<s> That was my companion. She sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice, of course.
<s> I think she went to bed —— I saw her going toward the house
<s> If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me
<s> I was looking for you.
<s> No, that's Thea's bed. Miss Wollsten's bed is in there.
<s> And the soldier -- He looked at me so strangely -- who is he?
<s> When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
<s> You were father's secretary -— I never thought - -
<s> This girl -- Thea —- is not a servant in my household, sir. She is my daughter's companion. Now, sir, if you'll excuse me, I'll go have a look at Mr. Jacks.
<s> There's no one there -— nothing but the caves and the dead.
<s> Oh, now —— now look here ——
<s> If she looked like Thea, she must have been beautiful.
<s> For a moment, when he looked at me so sadly, I felt that I had wronged him. But then --
<s> Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
<s> No.
<s> Made what?
<s> Sit down? What are . . .
<s> George Bailey.
<s> Yes, but George . . .
<s> I know. I know.
<s> Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
<s> Joseph, now show him what happened today.
<s> Yeah –– old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
<s> All in . . .
<s> Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
<s> Okay.  What's yours?
<s> What's that got to do with it? I don't know you from Adam's off ox.  Hey, you! Rummy! Come here! Come here!
<s> Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
<s> Oh, wait. Wait . . . Wait a minute.
<s> She was here first.
<s> Hello, Violet. Hey, you look good. That's some dress you got on there.
<s> Hello, Violet.
<s> Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
<s> Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?
<s> I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
<s> Hello?
<s> Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
<s> This way.
<s> They're not my children.
<s> The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let's look at your side. Young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight . . . married, making, say . . . forty a week.
<s> I don't like coconuts.
<s> I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
<s> Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair.  Am I talking too much?
<s> Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
<s> Didn't you tell her?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
<s> I didn't want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like you.
<s> Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
<s> You have no idea what's happened to me.
<s> Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George?
<s> Hmm? Well, I . . .
<s> What the hell.  For you....
<s> Someone pop your balloon?
<s> What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
<s> I could give you a dozen good reasons.
<s> Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
<s> The drugstore's closed?  What the hell time is it?
<s> Right.
<s> You can't stop me.
<s> But I signed for the boat.  You' re not authorized any more.
<s> Got it.
<s> No place special.  Just hanging out.
<s> You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Hey, come on....
<s> You said something about a camera.
<s> Too late, it's written.
<s> First things first.
<s> The Shark's mouth.
<s> I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....
<s> My boss and your boss.  Sure.
<s> And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
<s> Home it is.
<s> What're you guys doing today?
<s> That's great.
<s> What'd I say?
<s> Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it.  Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me....
<s> Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw....
<s> Turn in the car.  Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.
<s> Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
<s> I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
<s> Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
<s> What?
<s> What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls?  Jesus, it's right there in front of you. I know what a goddamn shark looks like, I've been through it, don't you understand?  I've seen this sonofabitch before!
<s> Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
<s> Dad!  Dad!
<s> Waiting for Andy.
<s> None at all.  I wonder what the Brebner twins are doing tomorrow night.
<s> Gaff rigged?  Why not a staysail schooner?  Go anywhere.  Look at this -- the Mayan, an Alden schooner.
<s> 3:30.
<s> Next week.
<s> That you'll put down a blanket.  I've got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my Mom's getting uptight about them.
<s> No.
<s> Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
<s> Would you take him?
<s> What the hell is he doing?
<s> I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted.
<s> No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
<s> I can get it.
<s> With those camera lights and...
<s> No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
<s> Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
<s> Yeah.  Down there.
<s> No.
<s> How many sharks have you killed?
<s> No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
<s> Just put your mask on.
<s> No.
<s> They just wanted to say hello.
<s> Up.
<s> I think so.  I'm not sure... Are you?
<s> Yes.
<s> No, you're not.
<s> How's your patient?
<s> ... Mean through the tubes?
<s> I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
<s> It's a shark's tooth!
<s> ... Okay.
<s> I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
<s> Well, we'll just try again, dear. Keep working on it.  Maybe you'll get it one of these years.  Pack up, boys.  Flipper's a flop.
<s> I think we can capture it.  I'd like to try.
<s> I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
<s> It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
<s> Because I don't trust you, that's why.
<s> Afraid I can't do that.
<s> Somebody could have gotten hurt.
<s> Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  Now you're helping to nurse it back to life.
<s> And here I thought I was charming you.
<s> Get ready to go.
<s> Brian, he's coming around!
<s> The water ski show!  We have to get them out!
<s> He's missing.
<s> How you doing, Kelly?
<s> Massachussettans aren't.
<s> ... Massachussettans aren't.
<s> Are you really?
<s> Now what?
<s> Well, we're not going to hurt it, old boy.  I say, love, is Flipper ready to go?
<s> Precisely.
<s> Five hundred yards.
<s> Always do.
<s> It's not closing, Mike.
<s> All right, hit those lights too.
<s> ... I'll go to McDonalds.
<s> Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
<s> Puppy love.  This time it's real! We can have a double wedding.
<s> Sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the Jeep.
<s> He told me you both did....
<s> Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now....
<s> I thought artists worked with their subconscious....
<s> But it went away...We would have known....
<s> You caught me....
<s> What difference does it make?  It's here....
<s> Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
<s> He heard that.
<s> What's going on?
<s> Mommy lets me....
<s> Good night, Daddy....
<s> Mother....
<s> I'm just getting started....
<s> I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....
<s> Why'd you come out here?
<s> Doesn't matter....
<s> Boss' day off...Take the wheel....
<s> Sure you can....
<s> No, you're not....
<s> Good.  I have two left....
<s> That's hard to imagine....
<s> I'm sorry...I....
<s> The whole idea is preposterous....
<s> My vision is perfect....
<s> Give me a hand here for Christ's sake....
<s> You got a better idea...?
<s> They spend half their lives looking for food and the other half eating it   They don't care what it is....
<s> I fly elephants for smugglers....
<s> Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
<s> Inch by inch....
<s> So far..
<s> You think he's not good enough for her?  You're right.  If she was my mother, I'd send her home right now.
<s> Close...I don't know...Just get the hell....
<s> I live to hear the sound...You all right?
<s> My equipment doesn't crap out....
<s> No way....
<s> I'm training to....
<s> I'd have to manage a nookie parlor to do that....
<s> Gone to Ben Masters' place.  Cow tipping.
<s> Yeah?
<s> I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
<s> I think you're here all day.
<s> Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here.
<s> Seven thirty-five .. Here, "Town Gets Top Cop." I was gonna pin it to your wall.
<s> It's a method for quitting smoking.
<s> Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
<s> Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?"
<s> No, you didn't.
<s> I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
<s> I was wrong.
<s> Car accident.
<s> No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking.
<s> <u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
<s> Are you sure you didn't call?
<s> Bits.
<s> It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
<s> And did they?
<s> I've heard you call him Freddy.
<s> Why not? You heard my voice?
<s> No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..
<s> Yes, Sir.
<s> I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
<s> Don't mix very well with beer.
<s> I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R.
<s> A derelict.
<s> Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
<s> Okay, this is working.
<s> Go ahead.  Jump right on into my nightmare.  The water's warm. _ 65.
<s> I'm not trying to make history. _ 67.
<s> You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.
<s> I see what you're saying.
<s> "It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
<s> They ain't laughing, man. Something's wrong.
<s> I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
<s> Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.
<s> Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.
<s> We are?
<s> Well, I'm happy for you.
<s> Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.
<s> Hi.
<s> Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
<s> Mission... statement...
<s> Plus, you could use that commission.
<s> Bye you guys. _ 88.
<s> Tell me -- let me help --
<s> He's in the living room asleep.
<s> We decided to stay with you.
<s> I'll give it everything.
<s> I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door.
<s> Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
<s> I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money."
<s> Great word.  Towel?
<s> No.  A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
<s> What's that supposed to mean?
<s> Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
<s> Damn right.
<s> I missed ya.  What can I say?
<s> A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.
<s> Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no!
<s> Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
<s> "Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
<s> You okay?
<s> You did this to yourself.  You said "fewer clients."  You put it all on paper.  Scully was very upset.  Heart attacks make some people sweeter, but not him.  You did this to yourself --
<s> Thanks.  May I offer you both a ride?
<s> Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right.  _ 76.
<s> Yeah I know.  I did.
<s> That's why they cheer, you know. The white man sending the black man into battle...
<s> Shut up!!!
<s> What?
<s> Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back.
<s> Nothing you haven't seen before.
<s> Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
<s> Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.
<s> Eric!
<s> I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...
<s> I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
<s> But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
<s> KEEP GOING!
<s> It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
<s> In Costa Rica?
<s> Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.
<s> A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
<s> Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?
<s> Like if you shoot yourself in the foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.
<s> Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
<s> It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
<s> You were right -- and I was wrong. There!  Did you ever think you'd hear me say that?  Spectacularly wrong. Instead of observing those animals, I tried to control them.  I squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives.  Not their lives as man would have them, behind electric fences, but in the wild.  Behavior in their natural habitat, the impossible dream of any paleontologist.  I could have had it, but I let it slip away.  Thank God for Site B.
<s> Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
<s> Everyone, keep your voices down!
<s> I want to see the nesting ground!
<s> This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
<s> Come on!
<s> You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.
<s> My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
<s> Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.
<s> Good.
<s> There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
<s> Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!
<s> Oh, God.
<s> You're going too?
<s> Oh, my God.
<s> You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous.
<s> Our chance to do what?
<s> DAMN IT, BE SURE!!
<s> Look!  Sarah!
<s> Look, we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
<s> Now's the perfect time.  The animal just fed, so it won't stalk us for food.  Predators don't hurt when they're not hungry.
<s> What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it?
<s> Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
<s> They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
<s> So how much for our first tour.  Two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
<s> How would we cut off the lysine?
<s> 'Bout thirty seconds.
<s> Anybody at all.  Feel free to speak up.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?
<s> Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
<s> They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
<s> We're out of a job.
<s> It's my favorite.
<s> Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.
<s> I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
<s> I don't know.
<s> I get ah - -
<s> Dinosaur eats man.  Woman inherits the Earth.
<s> It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -
<s> Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?
<s> And even if we haven't seen it yet, I'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now.
<s> Please - - chance it.
<s> He sends his apologies.
<s> He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's getting a divorce.
<s> No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
<s> Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to be curious.
<s> Hey!  Where are the brakes?
<s> Yes it is.
<s> That's a good idea.
<s> It's good protein.  Come on, Lex.  Why don't you touch it?  Look at his nose.
<s> You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
<s> Try to!
<s> Me?  Oh, hell yes.  Three.  I love 'em.  I love kids.  Anything at all can and does happen.
<s> I know.
<s> When you gotta go, you gotta go.
<s> For today, I guarantee it.
<s> What kind of opinions?
<s> No, I'm sorry, that  wouldn't be possible.  We've just discovered a new skeleton, and - -
<s> After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
<s> I'm trying to use psychology to get you out of the drain, you know!
<s> Timmy!  The power is coming down, quick!
<s> Timmy, let go!  You're gonna have to let go!  Count to three.  I'll catch you.
<s> Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician!
<s> Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
<s> Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
<s> John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.
<s> Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
<s> You're all right, John You're okay.  It's just you don't have intelligence.  You have "thinktelligence."  You think narrowly and call it "being focused."  You don't see the consequences.  You're very good at solving problems, at getting answers - - but you just don't know the right questions.
<s> Why did you do this?
<s> They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals.  And these are herbivores.
<s> That's what I said!  You're a nerd!  They don't call you people hackers anymore - - they call you people nerds!
<s> What?
<s> We're not talking about truth, we're talking about perception. And the perception is that Crystal Lake means inbred psychopaths running around the hills with axes and hockey masks chopping up teenagers.  That, my dear, is what we call an _image problem_.
<s> Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
<s> Fuck you.
<s> What?
<s> Shit. We're still putting the victim list together. You'll need a forklift for the case file. I suggest you hire some help, and don't expect to get a lot of sleep for the next few months.  You're about to defend the most notorious serial killer in American history.
<s> He doesn't look like he's going anywhere, Bill. And if necessary, I can get a judicial order reaffirming the right of my client to speak to his attorney in private.
<s> Because everyone knows he's guilty...
<s> Well, I definitely feel sorry for you.  August fourteenth, 1956... Jason was brought in by his mother, who said the boy hadn't slept for two weeks. Doctor prescribed Valium...
<s> Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
<s> That's open to debate.
<s> Me too. I'm drunk.
<s> I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
<s> I was there once... that was enough. Besides... I have to go out to Jason's house tomorrow.  They're... digging up some new evidence.
<s> It was Krueger, wasn't it?
<s> A cameraman caught him on videotape. Joe, I saw an entire sheriff's squad fighting and losing against an enemy that wasn't there...
<s> Checking out a theory. Just keep talking to him.
<s> About ten minutes.
<s> For the moment! You've only got about two minutes left! Hurry! Ruby takes off towards the Cineplex...
<s> No, no, no -- quite a long time, yes.
<s> -- In magazines nobody reads.
<s> Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
<s> What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
<s> In a manner of speaking.
<s> An empty tomb?
<s> I'll commit that to memory.
<s> Sit down, Kafka.
<s> It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
<s> Attitude, Kafka.  It doesn't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in.
<s> No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
<s> Yes.
<s> Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
<s> You won't have any trouble finding it.
<s> My only concern is the human tribunal.  Isn't it yours?
<s> Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
<s> Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
<s> Usually.
<s> I told you, they're <u>dead</u>.  It's finished.
<s> Well -- other departments are, yes.
<s> You mean you've actually begun some?
<s> I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
<s> I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see.  And I find you.  A body snatcher.
<s> Yes, well -- we're looking for a new village now.  If we stay too long at one source ... people become suspicious.
<s> Lying in the gutter where they belong.
<s> It usually is.
<s> Ludwig?
<s> It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
<s> Amerika for us!
<s> Look Mr Denham - you're not welcome here. Just pack up your cameras and go.
<s> I photographed it extensively, father.
<s> These are priceless artifacts! They're ruining the site!
<s> There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.
<s> We're leaving.
<s> Jack!...  Jack!
<s> We should never have come! I pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. You'll be hearing from my lawyer!
<s> ) They are now.
<s> Yeah? ... Well, I gave 'em a taste of American lead ... and I don't see 'em coming back for seconds!
<s> She's got a bit of an attitude, that girl. She's turned down a bunch of money. Too bad ... it would've been a great angle - "Beauty and the Beast".  I must be getting old - I thought you two had something going there.
<s> Sorry. 
<s> Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
<s> So do I.
<s> Here please.
<s> No, I'm look --
<s> Could I ask some questions?
<s> What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?
<s> -- OK --
<s> I don't want you to look up. There's someone on the skylight.
<s> Do you know where he got the dumper?
<s> Well, let's go down and ask him.
<s> Try some other ways. 
<s> Well --
<s> What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.
<s> How?
<s> I don't get you.
<s> My bed.
<s> Yup.
<s> I was wondering what that was.
<s> Drop it.
<s> About what?
<s> I wanted to give it to you first.
<s> Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
<s> Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
<s> Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And there's more every day man, there's more everyday.
<s> I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann.
<s> I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
<s> Trask --
<s> Yes sir, we know he --
<s> Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly -- we've appreciated the Sergeant's interest you know, all along. Here, locally. But New York, that's - well --
<s> Yes?
<s> Detroit.
<s> The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?
<s> Wow!  French toast, really?
<s> Right.  One O.J. coming up.
<s> You got a letter from mom.
<s> I guess...
<s> That's okay...
<s> Oh, for God's sake...Here.
<s> No.
<s> I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.
<s> No!
<s> Uh huh?
<s> Sure.
<s> It's my name too.
<s> Uh, uh.  There was no such a thing as Burger King.
<s> Why does he decide?
<s> Where will my toys be?
<s> Overruled.
<s> Six years.
<s> Objection!
<s> No questions.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> So we've got problems.  Everybody's got problems--that's normal--
<s> I don't know...
<s> Joanna, what the hell is--
<s> You want to know the real kicker?  The real kicker is, for the first time in my life-- the first time--I feel like a loser.
<s> I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
<s> I don't know, Jim...
<s> Well, ah...I thought it over and I decided we're doing it Murray's way.
<s> Mmmmnph...I'll get you a cab...
<s> Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.
<s> Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--
<s> Kramer...There's something I ought to tell you.
<s> I know....I know.
<s> No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
<s> I can't tell you how sorry I am.
<s> Look, Ted, all I--
<s> I understand.
<s> I told her you're doing a
<s> Sure.
<s> What?
<s> Uh, huh...
<s> Ted, I just heard...
<s> Can I do anything I want?
<s> And you have horses? You love horses.
<s> Will you buy the sheep for me?
<s> Thank you. Please sit.
<s> We did not.
<s> We do not know.
<s> Answer. 
<s> When it is time.
<s> Ask whatever you will.
<s> You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
<s> You will always!
<s> True.
<s> Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this.
<s> The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe.
<s> Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.
<s> We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
<s> You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest.
<s> 'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
<s> They can survive winter.  As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive,  am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?
<s> No!!  Out!
<s> Deep down, gut check.  I'm growing fond of <u>you</u> and it's liberating to say so.
<s> I coulda shot you, you--
<s> They don't really attack underwater and--
<s> Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
<s> That's actually the easy part.
<s> Tranq guns down, rifles up!
<s> That hurt my feelings.
<s> Nothing's real.
<s> You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
<s> There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
<s> Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.
<s> I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
<s> I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--
<s> Good.  See ya soon.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
<s> A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
<s> It's okay.
<s> I heard something.
<s> You calm down!
<s> Good idea.
<s> He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
<s> So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
<s> Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
<s> Let's go.
<s> Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I wanna know why that monster is here.  You got a theory?
<s> <u>You</u> <u>gotta</u> <u>be</u> <u>kidding</u>.
<s> I'll take it!
<s> Well.  At wakes.
<s> Seconds.  Three, four.
<s> What kind of backup do we have?
<s> Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
<s> They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken.
<s> It's to make you <u>understand</u> him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.
<s> I asked you to be nice to him.
<s> He said he knew Karate!
<s> A tooth?
<s> Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
<s> I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
<s> Well on this one I'd like you to be.
<s> <u>Kelly</u>--
<s> Kevin told me you were upset.
<s> Kelly--
<s> Shitbutt?
<s> Stay cool. Just remember to call him "God."
<s> Why does she keep repeating the name?
<s> He's here, Ardelia.
<s> Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?
<s> Well, except for the one girl.
<s> Agent Mapp! Thank you!
<s> NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
<s> Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
<s> I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
<s> Who's the subject?
<s> Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
<s> I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
<s> He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
<s> What he does with them - takes privacy... Time, tools... He's in his 30's or 40's - he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self-control. He's cautious, precise, never impulsive... This won't end in suicide, like they often do.
<s> He starts this - buzzing in me, in my head. He makes me feel violated... You used me, Mr. Crawford.
<s> It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
<s> Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum.
<s> You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
<s> Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries.  Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA "John Grant." Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name.
<s> They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
<s> Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?
<s> Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
<s> Was it a butterfly?
<s> A cattle ranch?
<s> No. We just -
<s> And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
<s> I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.
<s> And by sea!
<s> Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
<s> Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
<s> Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
<s> Only chance we got is...  ... to get more distance on 'em and go to ground!
<s> You're not coming with us?
<s> No.  Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one... Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk & Fox. And make the Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong as the whites.
<s> What else?
<s> ...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
<s> What did you see, Major?
<s> Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
<s> Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements!
<s> Fire!!!
<s> Fire!
<s> "Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.  When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness."
<s> Gifts?
<s> Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
<s> Yengeese Major give all property to Magua.  Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, many gifts, maybe three, four oxen.
<s> Heart. Give Magua new heart.
<s> That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.
<s> Magua slept hard in the English wigwams.  And the sticks left their mark...  Magua's village and lodges were burnt. Magua's children were killed by the English.  Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another. The Grey Hair was the father of all this.  In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk to become free. In his heart he always was Huron.  And his heart will be whole again on the day when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead!
<s> My master requires the fort be destroyed.  But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge.

<s> Where's Doc?!
<s> Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
<s> It bit me!
<s> Jones...come with me.  Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms.
<s> Ahhhh!
<s> Okay.
<s> I know that.
<s> What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
<s> I realize you must have gone through hell--
<s> Whooo!  Right on, Cobb!  Let's hear it for our shop Steward!
<s> Shhhh...don't tell no one.  Job security.
<s> He didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine <u>precaution</u>."
<s> I don't know.  I'm guessing.
<s> "Debbie Does Dallas"...  Hell, it's in Russian.  I can't read it...
<s> Sleeping.  No sign of Doc, though.  I'll check the control room.  You look in the shower room...
<s> Jameson?  Who are you trying to con...?
<s> Answer them and quit kicking me!
<s> Right.
<s> I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.
<s> A traffic warden. Look, what's this?
<s> Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart.
<s> We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
<s> Yeah, Bazza, what?
<s> Fucking Northern monkeys.
<s> Well, I suggest you speak to him, then.
<s> Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?
<s> We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.

<s> Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.
<s> OK, open the gate.
<s> How about you? All right?
<s> Get the sodding gate open now, Plank.
<s> All right, all fucking right, I am coming.  Willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, OK.
<s> Invitations?
<s> Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
<s> Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon?

<s> Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.
<s> The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him.
<s> Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.
<s> We paid seven hundred quid for those guns. They could hardly trace them to you, could they?
<s> Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.
<s> Do you want me to draw a picture?
<s> What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.
<s> I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
<s> I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
<s> You know it doesn't include the amp.
<s> Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
<s> I'll only be a minute.
<s> I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.
<s> Oh, come on, Amado--
<s> Leave your sister out of it.
<s> Yes, sir--
<s> It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer.
<s> Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--
<s> Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
<s> September '97, that's all she wrote.
<s> I roust some muchacho on the street, doesn't have his papers, all he got to say is "Yo trabajo para Jimmy Herrera."
<s> You're fired. You're outta the department.
<s> Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore--
<s> Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
<s> You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
<s> Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
<s> He a Black man or an Indian?
<s> But they were Indians themselves.
<s> That guy who got shot--
<s> "Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?"
<s> I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--
<s> It's a lead mine.
<s> Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
<s> If I stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine--
<s> Seriously, I think we should get married.
<s> Pleased to meet you.
<s> You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
<s> Have we had trouble there before?
<s> Appreciate it, sir.
<s> Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
<s> Protection?
<s> Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
<s> We was crossin' the river--
<s> I am marry to the cousin of a friend-- but only to be able to live here. This is the mother of my child--
<s> Senora, anything it costs, I can work--
<s> We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school--
<s> I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
<s> No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
<s> And I understand why you might want to think he could.
<s> Do you?
<s> Steve?
<s> I don't mean Fernando.
<s> I never said that.
<s> Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone.
<s> Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
<s> Okay? He's not here?
<s> And when my father was Sheriff?
<s> It's Saturday.
<s> Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
<s> Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.
<s> Hey, Pete. How's it going?
<s> How much you got left?
<s> You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
<s> I thought he busted you a couple times.
<s> We haven't talked since high school.
<s> You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
<s> Pilar--
<s> Couple months before I was born--
<s> This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
<s> Another woman?
<s> You know who it was?
<s> Name's Otis.
<s> They go together.
<s> My life was too weird for her.
<s> D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
<s> Right.
<s> He's a priest?
<s> So tell me where Nix is buried.
<s> And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
<s> Yes...
<s> Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there.  Ask Pimm.
<s> Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared...
<s> I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
<s> He's an illusionist.  It's not exactly brain surgery.
<s> No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,
<s> When do you want me to start?
<s> I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
<s> Some or it.
<s> Nothing?
<s> You can't.
<s> Good.  There.  Yes?
<s> Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
<s> Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
<s> I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
<s> Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
<s> Evil.  He was evil.  Come on.
<s> It's one in the afternoon.
<s> Maybe I just bought it.
<s> Swann's wife.
<s> No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.
<s> We've got to get you to a hospital.
<s> What?
<s> Yes...
<s> Well... nobody.
<s> Didn't know you read minds.
<s> Is that all?
<s> Is he the Puritan?
<s> You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
<s> I should have been honest with you, right from the start.  I wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  I was born to murder the world.
<s> Two years.
<s> 25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?
<s> Philosophy.
<s> I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
<s> Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
<s> Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
<s> No, how about you?
<s> I'm here for the week.
<s> Ok.
<s> OK, see you downstairs.
<s> Yeah, you don't remember?
<s> You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
<s> We established that we have no communication.
<s> Fuck off.
<s> Yeah, look at that thing.
<s> I don't want to be.
<s> No, we'll find something around here.
<s> Hi, Bob.
<s> That sounds great — can you hold on...  What Zoe?
<s> Ok, well... I love you.
<s> Bob?
<s> Is this a bad time?
<s> Is there anything I can do?
<s> That's ok.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Good...I'm tired.
<s> That's ok, you'll figure it out.
<s> I got some hair stuff.
<s> Bye.
<s> Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
<s> Are you sure you have to go?
<s> It'll just be a few days.
<s> I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
<s> It's probably trivial.
<s> Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
<s> When did they find her?
<s> No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
<s> I don't know.  What are they?
<s> Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
<s> It's nothing.
<s> You know how I feel.  The world is random.  The only certainty I believe in is death.
<s> Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
<s> You are my son.  Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
<s> I had to.  There was no other way. Their deaths were part of the greatest legacy I could have given you.
<s> I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
<s> Miette, come here and relax.
<s> In the end, the jury saw it my way.
<s> An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed.  Disastrously.  Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body.  I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry.  He's pretty amazing.
<s> I had to.
<s> Peter, please...
<s> I'm going to look around.
<s> What's the...OH SHIT!
<s> I've filed a report with Father Frank.
<s> You know what they say.  You have the same chance of winning whether you play or not.
<s> Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.
<s> Sure thing.  Look, I've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts.  You can go home.  Gimme til morning.  Find out who he is. Until then, don't sweat it, huh?  Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.
<s> How're you doin' today?
<s> She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans.  Parents died when she was 13.
<s> Not what the records show.  Anyway, she was a runaway, arrests for vandalism, petty theft, drugs, the whole bit. Parole records show she graduated from community college, moved into a retreat house, teaches some classes at the seminary school, hasn't been in any trouble since.
<s> Don't curse.
<s> Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Shh.  It's okay.
<s> It's okay.
<s> You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
<s> Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive.  You belong on the court.  Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.
<s> Hey.  You just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. Let me worry about your date.
<s> Dad.  What are you doing here?
<s> I was just playing ball.
<s> Didn't have to try very hard.
<s> How do you say "you're dreaming" in Italian?
<s> Sometimes.  But what's the alternative, not playing?  You remember big Toni?  She quit last year, now she's working at some bookstore.  I mean, look at us. They treat us like we're Hollywood stars over here.  We just played in the championship game.  It doesn't get much sweeter than this.
<s> Lucky.
<s> My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
<s> He works at a bank.
<s> I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
<s> Kay.
<s> For how long?
<s> My Dad always drives my Mom.
<s> Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
<s> And?  She's not saying, "I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."
<s> Who said I'm not getting recruited?
<s> God, here we go.
<s> I don't.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Hey.
<s> I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.
<s> What?
<s> I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
<s> Not really.
<s> Cheap date.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
<s> We won the championship.
<s> Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
<s> Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
<s> What?
<s> What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
<s> For what?
<s> So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
<s> At one in the morning?
<s> Keep your voice down.
<s> What's that, not great?
<s> Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later the truth'll come out.
<s> "Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
<s> You came out early.
<s> Tell me what?
<s> A case like this could hang around for months and I'm up for this player relations job with the "Clips."  This gets out, false or not, no one'll touch me.
<s> No.
<s> And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
<s> Alright, so I'm gonna transfer you over to Frank's assitant, Janet she's gonna see what she can do --
<s> I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door --
<s> I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
<s> I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia. I'm sick.
<s> Now STOP IT and LISTEN to me right now. I AM DYING, I GOT SICK...now I fell down and I'm Not...DON'T --
<s> Did you hear what I said?
<s> Who was it?
<s> Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
<s> It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
<s> If you're not here for a 422 --
<s> What is it?  Did you forget something?
<s> Well...is that illegal?
<s> Really?
<s> ok.
<s> Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.
<s> Yes.
<s> You mind if I come in, check things?
<s> Sure, why?
<s> I can check on that for you, maybe we can take a tour --
<s> I should maybe go to the bathroom.
<s> Stay quiet...stay quiet, son --
<s> Son, don't --
<s> Sorry, little man.
<s> No Can Do.
<s> What happend?
<s> Yeah, I'm here, I'm off the elevator, walking down the hall, now --
<s> Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
<s> It's...doesn't matter....
<s> I can help you through this the best I know how but there are certain things you are gonna have to be strong about and take care of, now we can go over them, but I need to know that you're listening to me, ok?
<s> Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is.  He is dying very, very rapidly --
<s> I've seen it before.
<s> How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
<s> Who are you gonna call?
<s> Twelve.
<s> What?  Say it again...walking in the car?
<s> Let's talk about --
<s> It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
<s> -- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
<s> Not really.
<s> Mm. Hm.
<s> What am I doing?
<s> no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?
<s> I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he.
<s> Well I guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms?
<s> Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
<s> Uh. huh.
<s> ...ok...
<s> You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
<s> Are you lyin' to me?
<s> Ok. What's your name?
<s> And what about screaming?
<s> No.
<s> I don't have to do a god damn thing.
<s> Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN and don't do this. I want you to stay --
<s> What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
<s> I won't.
<s> I don't know.  I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march --
<s> No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....
<s> --- don't.  don't.  Please.  Just... listen to me...honey....  ...I've done...I've cheated on you.
<s> How long with Ellen?
<s> Maybe...I don't...
<s> Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
<s> What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --
<s> Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
<s> ....it's alright....
<s> I'd like to get an order of...um...peanut butter.
<s> And um....do you have Swank magazine?
<s> Thank you.
<s> I gotta go to the bathroom.
<s> I'm sick of being the one, the one who always has to do everything, I don't want to be the one always --
<s> Sure.
<s> I didn't know the answer --
<s> It's not right.
<s> It's raining frogs from the sky.
<s> This happens....this is something that happens.
<s> And you were not hurt?
<s> M'lady...?
<s> We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy.
<s> I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
<s> Shut up, knave!
<s> I am with you!
<s> You seek facts, when it would be better to seek truth.
<s> Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
<s> In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
<s> Three days??!!
<s> But -- what is Porthos doing?
<s> The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?
<s> Paris.  There is still much to do. We'll be back soon.  Be ready.
<s> I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King.
<s> It presses us but it is good for us too!  Louis' whims make him more vulnerable.  We are less ready, but so are his guards!
<s> They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
<s> Forgiveness?
<s> Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane.  If we are to have a place of private prayer, where better than here, beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river?
<s> I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?
<s> Because the old king had a twin as well, and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne.  Then he had two heirs, not just sons but twins.  So he decided that one be put away, as if he never existed.  You, Phillippe.
<s> Well... Well... Okay.
<s> We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.
<s> Bread and wine... in that cupboard.
<s> Who does?
<s> I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.
<s> At a ball, everyone watches the King!
<s> If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
<s> I came to see you safely out.  Check for yourself.
<s> I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.
<s> I will sit with you.  I can't sleep either.
<s> She will be at the ball.
<s> Phillippe.  Rest now.
<s> I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!
<s> Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.
<s> You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan.
<s> ... tired.  Must... lie down.
<s> Thank you, Keeper.
<s> What was the end page?
<s> Out directing the search for the traitors.
<s> How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
<s> No, you may wait behind the screen.
<s> I did not want to upset you.  It was tragic.  I did everything I could for him.  I ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting.  But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger.
<s> Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --
<s> Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
<s> We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
<s> If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
<s> Cooperate?
<s> Hey what they did on their time was their business, you know?  I just want to catch this scumbag, wherever he is.
<s> That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
<s> No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
<s> Could explain why Fleming was there.
<s> Seattle.
<s> Figure you would have tried it already.
<s> I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
<s> I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
<s> What happened with the tape?
<s> Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in?
<s> Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!
<s> I have nowhere else to go, Tubbs, I need your help!
<s> That was Peterson upstairs.
<s> You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on-one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?
<s> Why aren't you ever alone with him?
<s> Because it's his bad luck to be special.
<s> No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
<s> No.
<s> I know...
<s> After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it.  Where's Lector now?
<s> Wait, Will...
<s> I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.
<s> It's a foregone conclusion. For Christ's sake, it's eleven PM.  The full moon is tonight.
<s> We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.
<s> Let's get to the physical.
<s> Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
<s> It'll do fine.
<s> You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?
<s> Are you okay...?
<s> It's me.
<s> I'm very scared.
<s> Yes.
<s> No. I don't want to see you.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yeah. It's right here.
<s> It's written on toilet tissue.  'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming.  'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.  Just as the source of light is burning.  Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched out, then it says...  'I have a complete collection of your press notices.  I think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The "Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate.  Investigator Graham interests me.  Very purposeful looking. I hope we can correspond.  There's another piece missing here. I'll read the bottom part.  'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet.  Signed: Avid Fan.  It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom.
<s> Maybe you can help me. This is Bob Greer of Blaine & Edwards Publishing Company. Dr. Bloom asked me to send a copy of 'The Psychiatrist and the Law' to someone. Linda never sent me the address and phone number.
<s> No. I can help you.
<s> You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
<s> I don't think I'll tell you.
<s> He only bit women so far, right?
<s> What's average?
<s> I call him a monster.
<s> I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything.
<s> Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it...
<s> Blue, then.
<s> You got a deal...
<s> Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet.  On the news they said he was a white man. He isn't really, is he?
<s> You going back down to Florida after?
<s> No, I'm okay. I just wanted to...  ...stop by and...
<s> No.
<s> Very interesting, even to a layman.
<s> I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
<s> I haven't decided yet.
<s> It's a veddy small island in de Caspian Sea.  It sunk. GEORGE Oh.  Hm.  I'm uh, sorry.  Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind -- but I think you're very interesting.  If you ever need representation... we should talk.
<s> The stewardess let me keep my headphones.
<s> I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter.
<s> I refuse.
<s> Of course!  That's what negotiations are for.
<s> Those are my terms.
<s> I don't know!  Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain?  The audience... or yourself?
<s> There'll be other shots.
<s> That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
<s> I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
<s> No!  That is NOT an audience!  That is PLASTER!  An audience is people made of flesh!  They -- live and breathe!  Got it?!
<s> Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
<s> But it's only for thirty seconds!
<s> Okay, great!  So let's reset!
<s> If you want...
<s> They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
<s> Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
<s> What?!?
<s> Nah.  The girls sponge off between johns.
<s> What is this, World War Two...?
<s> No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!
<s> Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  Isn't that true???
<s> And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
<s> But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
<s> Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
<s> Sure it is.  Tony called me himself. He yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy's. They're both going on tonight, believe me!
<s> So your name's not Gorsky.
<s> He said he's coming back!
<s> Why isn't he MOVING??
<s> See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin' about!  Here!  I'LL give you a little humor!
<s> We have no choice but to continue as planned.  Deploy the sentinels. Immediately.
<s> Know what?
<s> And you are?
<s> Should Tank I.D. it?
<s> All the time.  It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.
<s> Any time.
<s> What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure?
<s> There are only two ways out of this building.  One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody.  You take a chance either way.  I leave it to you.
<s> The agents --
<s> Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
<s> You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197.  I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.
<s> Your mind makes it real.
<s> The body cannot live without the mind.
<s> What's going on?
<s> Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.
<s> Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!
<s> I need the main wet-wall.
<s> Who?
<s> I'm not the One.
<s> How do you know that name?
<s> Gee-zus.
<s> They're watching you, Neo.
<s> Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.
<s> That's different.
<s> Are you worried?
<s> A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something.
<s> I don't know.  It just went dead.
<s> Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
<s> I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.
<s> Why?
<s> Yeah?
<s> It wasn't fast enough.
<s> They're hacking his mind.
<s> I know that's what it looks like, but it's not.  I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  I understand that now. That's why I have to go.
<s> Tank, I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter.
<s> Look fella...this is private...
<s> Ok.  Wait here.
<s> 'Thou art then a king?'
<s> Kennedy.
<s> Listen...I'm a guest here.
<s> Cut it out stupid.  It's me.
<s> Yeah, take it easy.  Will you relax.
<s> Yeah, Teresa, shut up!  We don't wanna get Charlie here in trouble, do we?...We love Charlie.
<s> Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
<s> Mind your own business.
<s> Ok, how's everything going?
<s> My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.
<s> Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
<s> You're right.  You're right.  Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts.  You know that.
<s> Ok...that's it.
<s> 'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
<s> 'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
<s> Yeah, where's the rest?
<s> Hostess?
<s> Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
<s> Here.
<s> I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
<s> Now don't get excited.  Don't get excited!!
<s> Count it.
<s> Which one, the big tab or the little tab?
<s> You could say that.
<s> You ate?
<s> I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
<s> It's for the party, Dad --
<s> Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
<s> Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it for the appetizer.
<s> Well sir, it's 9:30 in the morning.
<s> Both.
<s> Yeah.  Goodnight.
<s> That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
<s> What side of the industry did you say you were on?
<s> "Death and Taxes"?
<s> What an odd pairing.
<s> I'll make a note of it.  Anything else?
<s> Yes.
<s> Uh -- he's from out of town --
<s> Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
<s> Yours.
<s> Certainly.  Goodnight.
<s> So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
<s> Certainly, Bill.
<s> Mandatory retirement upon our Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday.
<s> Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.
<s> 'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
<s> The train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard.  Would you like to hear the silver lining?  Check that, gold.  I've been working with John Bontecou all along.  We had a game plan -- acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder.  I set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park.
<s> He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.
<s> Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
<s> Sure.
<s> Do I?  I'm a little confused.
<s> What do you mean 'free'?
<s> I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else.
<s> How nice you look.  Is that your uniform?
<s> Watch me do what?
<s> It comforts you, doesn't it?
<s> I am, too.
<s> Please.  We don't need to talk about Drew.
<s> I love you in an evening gown.
<s> And you can't tell me who you are.
<s> It gets worse.
<s> Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.
<s> Good night to you, Bill.
<s> Yes, Bill.
<s> I understand.
<s> Why didn't you stop me?
<s> Are you going to fire me, Bill?
<s> I'm her father!
<s> Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
<s> This universe?
<s> Yes?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Say again?
<s> Get him in here.
<s> I'll take it from here --  I am --
<s> Speak up, please.
<s> I think you know --
<s> Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --
<s> Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.
<s> But we want you back, Bill.  Mean- while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details. And Mr. Black, may we say thank you.
<s> That's all?
<s> 'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
<s> Bravo.
<s> You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.
<s> I know.  But I'm the only father you've got.
<s> -- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.
<s> Cut it out, Susan.  You and I've got to talk.  Big day tomorrow, everybody.  Joe, let's go.
<s> Raise away.
<s> Then what will you say?
<s> What are you afraid of, Dad?  That I'll fall head over heels for Joe -- well, I have -- as you did with Mom.  That's always been standard, whether you like or not.
<s> Where's he going?
<s> I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> The fireworks are about to start.
<s> Not at all.  It was fascinating.
<s> You and 'Honey'?
<s> So you're a one-girl guy?
<s> 'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
<s> I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else!
<s> Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you?
<s> No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
<s> I have no memory.
<s> That must suck. All... backwards.				 *
<s> Hi, Leonard.
<s> Then why is this my handwriting?
<s> Why didn't you clean it out?					 *
<s> Hi, Leonard.
<s> You told me.
<s> But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
<s> Tell me about her again.
<s> Deals?
<s> I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
<s> Yes.
<s> Kill him.
<s> Just relax.
<s> Calls himself Dodd.
<s> What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
<s> I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
<s> You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
<s> Why not?
<s> Did Teddy send you?
<s> You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?
<s> So why did you come here?
<s> I don't remember.
<s> How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
<s> I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.
<s> She's involved with these drug dealers.
<s> The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.
<s> Wouldn't be appropriate.						*
<s> No. Don't worry, I'm a cop. Everything'll be okay. Is he still breathing?
<s> Are you sure?
<s> No. You took them out.						  *
<s> My mother calls me Teddy. I'm John Edward Gammell. Cheer up, there's a lot of John		    * G's for us to find. All you do is moan.			* I'm the one that has to live with what			 * you've done. I'm the one that has to put		    * it all together. You just wander around			* playing detective. You're living a dream,		   * kid. A dead wife to pine for and a sense		    * of purpose to your life. A romantic quest		   * which you wouldn't end even if I wasn't			* in the picture.							    *
<s> A load of amphetamine I told him I had.
<s> Turn around.
<s> Trudy and I are goin' for Gina...
<s> And what is that?
<s> I'm a fiend for mojitas.
<s> Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
<s> Havana.
<s> I am no one's wife.  I live in my own house.  I do not live in a man's house.  He has a wife.  We are together.  I am free.  Because of banking and finance and travel...  And I can do anything I want...
<s> Okay.  Macon, Georgia is where I was born. Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I was 14.  Then the military.  Then prison.  Because I was dumb and angry.  Then I read.  Then I got smart.  Then I discovered what I know, now...it's all business...
<s> Died in childbirth, having me...
<s> Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...
<s> Maybe.  Maybe with the crazy whites.
<s> ...it's gonna be an L-shaped ambush.  They're not gonna open up until they got the party favors, 'cause all they'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight. They <u>will</u> wait till they got the goods before they do the deed.
<s> No.
<s> He tried to..."do business"...with you.  Around ten.  His place.  Be there.
<s> And what do I do with him?
<s> Hey, Captain Kirk.  I think maybe I have second thoughts.
<s> Alonzo...
<s> Something's wrong.
<s> It says, "We do not fear you."  It says, "Fuck off and die."  It says, "We get down for recreation..."
<s> We could try to run loads into these guys.  Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group.
<s> What kind of weight?
<s> You think I am in so deep I forgot?
<s> "Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"?  What?
<s> We don't know.
<s> Haiti and Puerto Rico.  Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe.
<s> Where's Riccardo?
<s> Goodbye.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Slow and low, Adam A-500s...  ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  Small freighters.  We've done containers...
<s> Nothing.  'Cause how you do delivery on the beach, I don't like.  Maybe this does not work.
<s> It is.  He try to take tonight's load?
<s> Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...
<s> You sure are a pretty lady.
<s> Talking helps. Don't talk, you get muddled in your head. Hey! Now you just look at this here!
<s> Now take it. Go on.  Listen, where can I reach you? Cause I'm gonna make this right with you soon's I get me set up...
<s> It's sticky. What you do, slobber on 'em? I wouldn't touch 'em.
<s> So if you want me to hang around for a few days, I thought you should know.
<s> The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
<s> Well, what the hell, I got nothing better to do.
<s> Who?
<s> No doctors. No, sir. Not me. Doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug another. Operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver. My old man, for God's sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when he went to the doctor.
<s> I'll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that's all I ask.
<s> Gin's okay.
<s> Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
<s> ... and taxi fare for me.
<s> Yeah... Only the room service is lousy.  Come on, let me show you the tennis courts.
<s> History, man, history. How much?
<s> Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
<s> KNOCK IT OFF!
<s> How's your hernia?
<s> Stop shitting me, man!
<s> Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
<s> Dad...  I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.
<s> Nothing. Just twisted my ankle.
<s> For the money... )
<s> I know.
<s> But didn't have heroin.
<s> Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island.
<s> About as good as it looks.
<s> Twelve years.
<s> How long?
<s> And?
<s> Yeah.
<s> It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up.
<s> Max... Your BILLY shirt's on fire...
<s> Cut his fucking throat.
<s> Then I'll cut his balls off.
<s> Max - where?
<s> Maybe he's changing jobs.
<s> What is it? . . . Billy?
<s> Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?
<s> What?
<s> "Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?
<s> Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
<s> Depends.  You got a memo?
<s> The kid's with them!!
<s> Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere...  Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her.
<s> Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!
<s> No, there's...
<s> Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
<s> We can do it!
<s> I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his number-one fan...I've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection...  ...here I am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven't invited you in. Please.
<s> I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.
<s> Will I be able to walk?
<s> You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me.
<s> It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but "Misery" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title.
<s> Oh, it's ridiculous, who am I to make a criticism to someone like you?
<s> The phones are working?
<s> You'd be amazed at what some people will believe.
<s> The Sistine Chapel?
<s> Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly.
<s> Perfect.
<s> Yes.
<s> Great.
<s> You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
<s> What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?"
<s> I can't write this anymore.
<s> What?
<s> I think you're right.
<s> The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
<s> Three more chapters to go.
<s> Dome Pear-igg-non it is.
<s> I'm almost done.
<s> Well, this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the Sheriff.
<s> Could be--or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it. Could be a lot of things.
<s> Just from his agent.
<s> Oh, I like that tone.
<s> Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
<s> You're still a writer.
<s> Did they win?
<s> Here it is.  Very first copy.
<s> That'd be a first.
<s> I'm delighted the critics are liking it, and I hope the people like it, too. But it's not why I wrote the book.
<s> Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
<s> From her point of view or mine?
<s> Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
<s> Only because..it's spring..chalk it up  - to spring fever.
<s> I suppose I did.
<s> Well, that's good, isn't?
<s> Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
<s> Not as much as you feel like hearing it.
<s> You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
<s> Yep.  You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer.
<s> ..or hard wired..
<s> Right.
<s> No.  Just as if I'd like to.
<s> What if I pay the rent?
<s> Uh-huh?
<s> - torque wrench.
<s> Indeed.
<s> Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
<s> You didn't do that badly.
<s> Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
<s> Oh.  Well..this isn't exactly by the book.
<s> You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
<s> You can be a thief and have a conscience.
<s> Can you think of a better one?
<s> Then feel better!..
<s> What wouldn't make him suspicious?
<s> - Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.
<s> Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --
<s> You noticed.  What're you going to do? Spank me?
<s> You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
<s> She sacrificed herself..
<s> In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.
<s> No.  After you've lived with <i>Chimera</i> for twenty hours, nothing can save you.  Not even...<i>Bellerophon.</i>
<s> She must still be on the property.
<s> Do I?
<s> You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.
<s> What about him...?
<s> High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max.
<s> I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...
<s> What happened to Jim?
<s> I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.
<s> Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me.
<s> I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.
<s> Bastard!
<s> Yeah.  I follow you.
<s> Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
<s> Now I want you to hold onto it.
<s> Because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it.
<s> I'll get you close.
<s> Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
<s> I need one hundred thousand dollars.
<s> That depends.
<s> How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
<s> Let's move!
<s> We're not outta here yet.
<s> Give me a break, Pops.
<s> What about my coat?  I'll freeze.
<s> Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
<s> Why?
<s> I remember..
<s> If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. Iíll have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris.
<s> They stamped it, didnít they?  Those damn Gideons.
<s> Donít flatter yourself - six was for <u>Eastern Europe</u>.  You made a lousy deal - ten for the world?  What is that?  But I needed you for the transfer with Max.  I got a little extra change;  and you got a little extra too.
<s> Loud and clear.
<s> I think I might just take that look.
<s> And a lonely ass.
<s> No, I'm going.
<s> Very good.
<s> Well, what do you wanna talk about!
<s> I'm going to bed now.
<s> His brother.
<s> And go to confession.
<s> Ti amo.
<s> What's your news?
<s> Again?
<s> Let's go tell your Mother.
<s> You have such a head for knowing. You know everything.
<s> I don't know. I got a feeling.
<s> Yes.
<s> Excuse me.
<s> Maybe I should come back another time.
<s> He knew my husband who died.
<s> Why what?
<s> So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
<s> You think so?
<s> Because I have no Luck!
<s> I was dead, too.
<s> Get all of me. Take everything.
<s> That light.
<s> What?
<s> You ruined my life.
<s> He was having some fun. Yeah, well he's dead.  Come on, let's go in.
<s> I think that's it.
<s> How can you ask me that?
<s> I was.
<s> No.
<s> Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on!
<s> I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita.
<s> Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
<s> Maybe you're right.
<s> My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
<s> Bobo, take the cart away.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> A month from today?
<s> I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up.
<s> In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress.
<s> Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat.  Where's that card?
<s> No more he's not.
<s> The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT!
<s> You should think about this.
<s> Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
<s> I absolve you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.
<s> But why would a man need more than one woman?
<s> I don't know.
<s> It was a miracle!
<s> Sure.
<s> Yes.
<s> Is who down there?
<s> What would he be doing down there?
<s> I knew she had it.
<s> I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.
<s> Ni!  Ni!  Ni ... Peng ... Nee ... Wum!
<s> I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!
<s> So be it!
<s> Had enough?
<s> Come, Patsy.
<s> 'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
<s> Oh yes.  It's very nice + +  CUT TO BATTLEMENTS. THE TAUNTER  turns to some others. + +                              MAN +      I told him we already got one. + +  They all giggle. +
<s> Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!

<s> I'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I'd be wearing anyway.  That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs.  I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! Indoors and Out.  There's no stopping me now.
<s> I can't let her down now, Archie.
<s> Aye.
<s> Mr Brown, sir --
<s> That's a tautology lad.  If you say the Queen arranges something, you've no need to say she's done it personally.  That's understood.
<s> I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
<s> In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you.
<s> This is the top.
<s> What I do, I do for my Queen.
<s> Maybe, once.
<s> Ma'am.
<s> Aye, ma'am.
<s> I'm glad of it.
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her.
<s> Who by?
<s> What does he know about the Highlands?
<s> I'll decide when it's exaggerated.
<s> Yes, ma'am?
<s> The Queen forbids it.  I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you.  Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be.  Please.
<s> For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
<s> Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to spare the time.
<s> But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli.
<s> Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
<s> Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself.  As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it.
<s> The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
<s> Yes.
<s> A few days, ma'am.
<s> We were expecting you to return by six.
<s> Again?
<s> I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.
<s> They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> He is sick, ma'am.
<s> If I tell you, then it's no fun.
<s> Well, we're veering into classified info here, but I'll tell you that it involved a donor.  He was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening.
<s> Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.
<s> Call the others.  Laurie, Benz...
<s> I can't believe you made it!
<s> Everything.
<s> Yes it does.  Don't you see?  We have to play by the rules.  That's what it wants.
<s> And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
<s> One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?
<s> There never is.
<s> I just thought of something.  If we came back from the game...  ...what if ARCADE did too?
<s> I know.
<s> I'm okay.
<s> That way.
<s> In this world, wrong is right!
<s> You have no time.
<s> Not yet, honey...
<s> The game will guide you.
<s> I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
<s> Cynthia...what's going on?
<s> Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
<s> That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
<s> Okay.
<s> Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
<s> Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
<s> So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
<s> No. I can't.
<s> Diane?
<s> If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.
<s> We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
<s> I'm not sure about this.
<s> "I came back. I thought that's what you wanted."
<s> "Then they'd put you in jail."
<s> But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
<s> Keep going. Go around to the back.
<s> This Denny's.
<s> No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
<s> Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
<s> Good. Nice to see you, Bruce. Johnny.
<s> I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....
<s> Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
<s> Not listening !
<s> Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.
<s> What do you mean ?
<s> Fine...
<s> There's one more person here for me to visit.
<s> Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
<s> A dragon.
<s> Don't have to tell me twice.
<s> Let's just see if he can make it into round two....
<s> You've got to be kidding me ! His lazy ass couldn't win the special Olympics.
<s> When will that be ?
<s> For once in your life, shut the fuck up.
<s> Not that well sir. I believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building. Did we aquire a bank from Chicago or a charity ?
<s> Son, let's watch the tape.
<s> Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.
<s> Sir, he created the Park. He would know how to circumvent any of the traps.
<s> What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
<s> What did you hear ?
<s> I didn't think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new "Park".
<s> I'm listening.
<s> He's got two chices.either it's the Bowling Alley from Hell or Alice in Murderland. See this ? Even Bruce knows that no one can make it out of here in one piece.
<s> How can this happen ?
<s> I've never heard the Flintstones reduced to a sexual exploitation quite like that. You're funny.
<s> Hi. I brought some wine.
<s> Yahoo !!!!!
<s> Maybe all that testosterone plugs his ears.
<s> We just having our first date when you showed up.
<s> Zach from work ?
<s> Hey buddy. You okay ?
<s> Why don't you shut up now.
<s> Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
<s> I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
<s> Are you writing a poem?
<s> Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
<s> My only problem is that your Uncle Phil is giving me five bucks to pick you up but I don't get paid 'till delivery.
<s> Yeah, well I don't think you're very grateful. A lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;.
<s> I thought I told you to lose this guy.
<s> Pommeroy.
<s> No it's okay, I understand, really.
<s> What boy likes you?
<s> Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
<s> Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
<s> Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with you, it really means he didn't have nerve to ask you out on a date, so you'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying, and the next thing you know you're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars.
<s> How about a nice glass of milk?
<s> Phil's moving to LA, Grammoo's passing, the baby being born, Vada's report, I think...
<s> I remember Maggie...and your Dad too, you know we used to all pile into his old 54 Ford pickup. &quot;Chuck the Truck&quot; we used to call it.
<s> I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
<s> oh.
<s> Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly who's pregnant.
<s> Well...I'm not supposed to talk about it, but since I'm gonna write about it I might as well tell you. She was a spy against the Russians.
<s> That's simple. She was pregnant with me...when she went to Russia and she didn't know...and then when the Russians found out, they waited to shoot her 'cause you're not allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the world.
<s> Are you Jeffrey Pommeroy?
<s> What ever happened to a good old-fashioned favor huh?
<s> And you're gonna solve the mystery?
<s> I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
<s> Just remember the needle in the haystack.
<s> Change my name.
<s> What if you don't wanna be found?
<s> Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
<s> I want it back now. I never should have taken it off, I want it back.
<s> Give it to me!
<s> Just give it to me!!
<s> DON'T, come on!!!
<s> What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;???
<s> In the tar??
<s> What do you think?
<s> Nick?
<s> I'd consider it a personal favor.
<s> Well I know you're not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to know I appreciate it though.
<s> Vada, I know that traditionally you're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you're officially married...but these are very, very special circumstances.
<s> I don't know, he's got an awful lot on his mind right now.
<s> This is it I guess.
<s> He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
<s> You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
<s> Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
<s> Yes, I do.
<s> Oh, sure okay.
<s> Everybody did, walk along Citrus between Fountain and Sunset any afternoon.
<s> Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.
<s> WHAT?
<s> I'm impressed.
<s> Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your throat.
<s> Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...
<s> Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
<s> What do you mean??
<s> She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
<s> Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.
<s> I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
<s> I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
<s> Want to what?
<s> Okay.
<s> Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I promise.....
<s> I know that, but what do you want from me?
<s> Ya, that rack holds six ties.
<s> Then who's it for?
<s> No, sweetie, not yet.
<s> No sweetheart, you can't.
<s> He was allergic to bees.
<s> I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
<s> The last date I had was twenty years ago.
<s> Oh come on.
<s> Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
<s> It's summer! You're kids! Go play!
<s> I am.
<s> Well you don't know that. Ask him.
<s> Can we look around in your camper?
<s> Uh huh.
<s> NO!, He's fine.  Fish are very resilient animals you know. Don't worry, I won't get another fish.
<s> Well he just left, what's wrong?
<s> Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently.
<s> Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.
<s> I can't, I have to go home.
<s> That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
<s> I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> No.
<s> What?
<s> Yes.
<s> I am not.
<s> HEY YOU!!!!  I'm gonna get you!!!  I'll get you!!!!
<s> What?
<s> Hi Vada, can you come out?
<s> Okay, seeya.  Vada?
<s> ... weeks.
<s> He says, "Swear.  When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"
<s> And you believe that.
<s> I wish.
<s> Oh, you're more than okay.
<s> You need a few dollars.
<s> Can you watch the road?
<s> ... you want a menage on your wedding night.
<s> Not you.  You won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive.
<s> So your honeymoon is exactly where?
<s> ... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit...
<s> It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
<s> No.
<s> Ju...
<s> Bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad flights, bad hotels, real bad food. Homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four...
<s> I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...
<s> Sir, this is important! Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right?
<s> You don't understand.  I've never felt this way about anybody!
<s> ... Thomas, yeh.
<s> I need you.
<s> Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance??
<s> Endearingly absent-minded.
<s> She finds him "personable."
<s> Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?
<s> Boy, those were the days.
<s> Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
<s> Well, you've got the rest of your lives.
<s> I mean, you commit to a wedding. And then it seems like... this... momentum, you know?  You forget you... chose it.
<s> You're right.  Easy come, easy go.
<s> Mike.  I can't believe I'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding.  But I think you need and deserve to know...
<s> Love doesn't have to be right. It just has to be love.
<s> It's two weeks.
<s> To him.
<s> Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...
<s> This is USDA Prime, largely available, beef.  With no notice- able competition, present company excepted...
<s> With those big, dark, haunted eyes. As if you were harborin' some... unspeakably... guilty... secret.
<s> Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland.
<s> What's wrong honey.
<s> Honey, it's okay... How do you feel now?
<s> Hi. Come on in. Mary!
<s> D.C.
<s> Sue was trying to get hold of you.
<s> What is a turkey shoot.
<s> I'1l get your bag.
<s> Oh, well, thanks. Ah, oh, maybe you know where...
<s> Do you carry door handles?
<s> Sixty-three.
<s> How are you going to pay when you get sick?
<s> It just is.
<s> No, I don't.
<s> No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.
<s> Well, they removed my heart last week, but I'm doing fine except my nose fell off. Looks a little funny.
<s> I can't remember. In out/out in, something like that. Around eight.
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> That's what you said before.
<s> Oh.
<s> Oh.
<s> Eight-thirty in the chapel.
<s> How much?
<s> Hundreds of times.
<s> Thanks. You are just a wonderful person.
<s> He's pretty well known down here.
<s> How long have you been together?
<s> You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?
<s> I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
<s> That's what Tim said.
<s> Yes, they were.
<s> What...
<s> Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
<s> When ya had it, did ya like it?
<s> How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.
<s> What he said. We didn't know jack shit about and riot. It just happened. It was kismet. We didn't even know those people. How are we supposed to organize a riot when we've been in fuckin' isolation for the past year? Just bleep out the fucks and jack shits.  I mean, it's not like we care. If they wanna say we masterminded the whole thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep us up at night. But you said you wanted the truth, and the truth is we were just lucky.
<s> I said we'd give you an interview. I never said we wouldn't kill you.
<s> The prison board and the doctors who examined them.
<s> Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.
<s> You been followin' the news coverage?
<s> Five inmates, eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year's time... Very good. You do keep up with the headlines.
<s> Lobotomy Bay?
<s> Ain't love grand.
<s> Okay, Wayne, step forward.
<s> Whose ratings were higher?
<s> Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
<s> I'm keen with anticipation.
<s> No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
<s> I'm sure we will.
<s> Yes.
<s> So, what now?
<s> NO!!!
<s> No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!
<s> They actually apologized.
<s> I hear ya. Play.
<s> Rockin'!
<s> We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.
<s> How 'bout Mallory?
<s> When do you want the assembly?
<s> Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.
<s> Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
<s> Fine.  Julie, why don't you make a food run?  What's around here?
<s> Okay.
<s> No. You got the wrong idea.
<s> Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
<s> Like where?
<s> 'That right? I thought he was up North.
<s> Well, he worked around.
<s> No. Just me.  Me an' her.
<s> Oh yeah?
<s> You must be new in town.
<s> Yeah. On the section gang.
<s> No. My mother's dead.  You goin' back inside?
<s> No.
<s> You got a problem all right.
<s> It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.
<s> No.
<s> That's the way he is.
<s> No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
<s> I ain't seen him in a couple of years.
<s> How about it?
<s> My father's never done a thing for any of them.
<s> We'll be all right.
<s> Well, that don't do me one bit of good!
<s> There's nothing to say.
<s> Duff--
<s> What's eatin' you, Jocko?
<s> Great.
<s> She'll do.
<s> Yeah, sure. Good luck.
<s> Sure.
<s> Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad.
<s> It ain't in me.
<s> You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
<s> Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
<s> That'll make the folks very happy.
<s> Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?
<s> What's the matter now?
<s> The Elders, mon...
<s> What does this have to do with me?
<s> First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
<s> Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
<s> You son of a bitch...
<s> The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
<s> I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?
<s> You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
<s> What's he doing to my gear?
<s> What about McCoy?
<s> Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
<s> Stick with her. I want the process to become second nature to you. We fly for Freeside at dawn.
<s> This ain't Bangkok, chief.
<s> I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
<s> The words?
<s> As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
<s> This place empty as a tomb, mon.
<s> The girl 3Jane. We need her.
<s> When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
<s> It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
<s> So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
<s> We run. You crack the pattern?
<s> You can make your move when it comes after me.
<s> How long, Dixie?
<s> What?
<s> No!... No...
<s> People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
<s> This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
<s> Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
<s> For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
<s> Couple of days. They'll examine you.
<s> What the fuck... are you serious?
<s> If the splices aren't good, you could fry.
<s> So you're a wire junkie.
<s> They'll cut you down.
<s> That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
<s> What went down between you and Riviera?
<s> I know you have. C'mere.
<s> ...And if I guess wrong?
<s> Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.
<s> Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
<s> Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
<s> College?
<s> Right. 7:30.
<s> Well I'm so glad that you guys are.
<s> Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
<s> OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
<s> And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.
<s> That is lingerie.
<s> Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.
<s> Transitioned?
<s> Betty.
<s> Have you been to any parties?
<s> Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this.
<s> They hid my car--
<s> You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
<s> Are you in special ed?
<s> Hey. There.
<s> Yes. I'll go. Yes.
<s> You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
<s> Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about?
<s> Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
<s> No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
<s> I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
<s> I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie.
<s> Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.
<s> Thank you.
<s> What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
<s> But now you don't have to--
<s> Why?
<s> Thank you.  I'm Rob.
<s> Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.
<s> We can handle it.
<s> For this.
<s> Nothing.  W-w-what are you talking about?
<s> Whatever it is, it's none of your concern.
<s> <i>                      -- It's a bat. --              Will it bend? -- It's a rat. --              Will it break? -- Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake.</i>
<s> <i>                      You're so stupid, think now -- If we blow him up to smithereens, We may lose some pieces and then Jack will beat us black and green.</i>
<s> Who's Lisa?
<s> Did they tell you she went totally out of her mind - that they had to put her away?  And that her mother killed herself in our living room?
<s> You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
<s> I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body.
<s> No!  I don't know - everything's all mixed up.  What difference does it make?  I'm in trouble here.  I need your help.
<s> Yeah, yeah, sure.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Traumas of a ten-year old.
<s> Only it was more like, you know, sleep- walking.  All I know is I woke up on the cellar floor next to it.
<s> Who?
<s> I don't know.
<s> I don't know.  Where are we going?
<s> My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her.
<s> 'Morning, honey.
<s> Huh?
<s> Thanks, Mom.
<s> The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?
<s> Hi Mom.
<s> Can't it wait till morning?
<s> He's close...
<s> But I couldn't go until I told you how sorry I am for all the things I've done.
<s> You'll get to meet them all tomorrow. They're...survivors.  In a way.  All severely sleep disordered.  Insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting...
<s> Never been here before?
<s> Sounds like a rough time.
<s> Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
<s> There's nothing we can do.  It's out of our hands.
<s> Sshhh.  No time for that.  Come on.
<s> What about Kristen?
<s> And what are they?
<s> Neil, please --
<s> Only one thing can save the children. The unquiet spirit must be laid to rest.  It is an abomination to God and Man.
<s> A young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays.  The inmates managed to keep her hidden for days.  She was raped...hundreds of times. When they found her, she was barely alive...and with child.
<s> Accident my ass.  I thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here.
<s> Yeah?  What did we ever do?
<s> And you.  I'll wait till you've gone before I tell him you're a vegetarian.
<s> Fifteen million dollars.
<s> Fine.
<s> Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.
<s> Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
<s> Oh -- Okay.
<s> Hello.
<s> And what happens next in the dream?
<s> That's fine.
<s> Let's go in.
<s> There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
<s> Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
<s> Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
<s> 'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
<s> No.  What's that?
<s> Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
<s> But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
<s> I only found out you were here yesterday.
<s> Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.
<s> What's your name?
<s> Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God.
<s> Yes, they're shifting the whole outfit much more towards the trading side -- and of course...  I was total crap.
<s> What?
<s> Well, thanks, that's great.
<s> Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
<s> Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
<s> And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
<s> Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
<s> Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?
<s> Hello, Anna ahm...  Scott -- have some wine.
<s> Definitely no comment.
<s> So not over her, in fact.
<s> Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
<s> What?
<s> I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.
<s> Hello.  I wonder if I could have a little word.
<s> Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
<s> No -- you're right.
<s> Well, there are.  And we don't need to go anywhere near that far.  My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective.
<s> I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
<s> I'm going to throw out these old videos.
<s> Right -- let's talk about rent...
<s> What book?
<s> Yes, that is correct.
<s> I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
<s> Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...
<s> Mister McMurphy!
<s> Yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
<s> Sorry, ma'am.
<s> Yes, Mister McMurphy?
<s> That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy.
<s> Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
<s> Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
<s> I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
<s> He's into his wind-up. Here's the next pitch... and it's a hit! It's a hit!
<s> Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
<s> O-o-o-oh...
<s> Wh-wh-where ya going, M-M-Mac?
<s> W-W-Where we g-g-going?
<s> Ca-na-da...
<s> It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
<s> That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
<s> It's your dirty roll, Cheswick.
<s> Yeah, Mack?
<s> Let me get on your shoulders.
<s> I dunno. Where do ya wanna go?
<s> Shhh...
<s> Through the ass.
<s> What?
<s> I'm seeing what a busy man does.
<s> Okay, Harding, you're on.
<s> Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan... Yeah...
<s> No!
<s> A nickel.
<s> In what way?
<s> Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
<s> No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton.
<s> You're on.  Let's go! An' keep it quiet.
<s> Breakfast! Hell, I know just the place where we can chow down an' thaw out before we shoot back on home. 'Kay?
<s> Prayin', brother. Prayin'.
<s> No...
<s> Why, my head would just squash like an eggplant, McMurphy.
<s> Oh...
<s> After you, ma'am.
<s> I thought so.
<s> Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
<s> You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
<s> --separate, in the evening..."
<s> Yes.  We did.
<s> No...
<s> What's mezzaluna?
<s> Thanks.
<s> Non.  Please.
<s> Who's this?
<s> I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?
<s> Huh?  Uh, yeah-- I've gotta run. Tell Dwayne hi.  Maybe someday we can all get together.
<s> Because I don't have the right name?!
<s> Right now?
<s> Boy, that looks tasty.  What is that?
<s> I just wanted to keep an eye on you.  The guy's a total stranger, remember?
<s> The Boston Pops.  Season tickets.
<s> I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
<s> No.  I just came by to apologize.
<s> Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
<s> Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
<s> No, it isn't.  I called off my wedding all because of you.
<s> You would?  Really?
<s> Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
<s> It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
<s> No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
<s> Yes you did.
<s> I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect?  Well, guess what?... It isn't.  Not for you, not for anybody.
<s> What about your job?
<s> Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person. 
<s> Well, we're here.  And more importantly, he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else.
<s> What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?
<s> 'Course he does.
<s> And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.
<s> Larry bought himself cologne?
<s> Because I'm the one who's single.
<s> Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
<s> What?
<s> Like a detective.
<s> Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
<s> Hi.  Where've you been?
<s> Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
<s> When you could've found one in America.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
<s> What do the years matter?  I've known you for centuries...
<s> What?  You know him?
<s> She didn't give me a chance.
<s> You know Johnny when he gets mad.
<s> If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
<s> So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.
<s> Very simple. Just bring him to... that place we been using. Mac, you take care of the details. Call Gerry G. in if you think you need him.
<s> But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
<s> I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
<s> Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.
<s> Don't say that!
<s> What do you weigh these days, slugger?
<s> You training to be a nun or something?
<s> Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were—
<s> Some people got faces that stick in your mind.
<s> I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested —in pigeons.
<s> What do they do for you, except get in your way?
<s> Who says?
<s> Get away from me.
<s> Well, it's over.
<s> Terry...?
<s> He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .
<s> Someone else c'n take your confession.
<s> I'll find you a priest.
<s> How much is your soul worth if you don't?
<s> Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but—
<s> You know what you're askin'? You're askin'—
<s> Such as what?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Yeah, really!
<s> You'd be off the pier for good.
<s> O.K., O.K., That's enough.
<s> Yeah, once they're mated they stay together all their lives until one of 'em dies.
<s> Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You don't think I should turn him in... .
<s> First things first.
<s> It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.
<s> You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.
<s> How'd you get that.
<s> Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!
<s> Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.
<s> I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
<s> What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
<s> I'm not sure, myself. It's just a feeling I've had since the crash...Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this!
<s> I'm afraid I'll faint.
<s> Nothing is worth your life.
<s> I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
<s> I should hope not.  I hate you!
<s> There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
<s> Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
<s> At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
<s> There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
<s> I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
<s> What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
<s> I know a Glenn.
<s> Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
<s> His assistant.
<s> Listen to me.  I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.
<s> Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape from prison.  He tole me, I can't find him to see you.  So why don't you open this fucking door.  Okay?  So we can speak.
<s> Why you want to do that, to a frien'?
<s> The green-and-whites saw us.  One of 'em starts thinking, what's that car doing there?  Ties it to the break and turns around...
<s> Cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time, waiting to make her move.
<s> I wasn't feeling my best that day. I'd just drawn thirty to life.
<s> Uh-huh...
<s> Sure looks that way.
<s> Two hours.
<s> I saw Karen Sisco.
<s> I get that feeling, yeah.
<s> They sure do.
<s> Shit.
<s> And what happened to Carl?
<s> What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
<s> Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.
<s> You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
<s> I could walk out of here.
<s> Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.
<s> Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
<s> Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
<s> Thirty-two outta what, twenty?
<s> I wasn't asking permission.
<s> Shit, yeah.  White Boy even got busted for it.  White Boy, tell these boys the reason you went down on that burglary that time.
<s> I've seen 'em used on TV.
<s> A little.
<s> Sure.
<s> I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
<s> They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
<s> Faye Dunaway.
<s> Shit...
<s> Who was it answered the phone?
<s> Because you're having too much fun.
<s> Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
<s> I can go to the bar.
<s> I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
<s> It smelled.
<s> That's not what you were about to say.
<s> Why are you mad?
<s> You know who they are?
<s> No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
<s> A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.
<s> I'm not leaving Midge.
<s> The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
<s> Like what?
<s> You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
<s> Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
<s> Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
<s> Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
<s> Really?
<s> Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
<s> Can I do what?
<s> You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
<s> Oh...
<s> You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
<s> He said he stayed here last November.
<s> Your dog was killed?
<s> Huh.
<s> Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
<s> No.  Course not.
<s> Still...
<s> Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
<s> Where the fuck is Foley?
<s> Ten gees.
<s> White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no diamonds under the fuckin' mattress.
<s> Are they dead?
<s> He's been like that all day.  Hey Danny, you coming?
<s> You mean hiding them?
<s> He was that good?
<s> But...they called you Strange?  Because of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red Grange strange?
<s> You liked that?
<s> Hale-what?
<s> You guys are new?
<s> Kill the bastards!
<s> So what are you saying?
<s> They're coming around for another pass. You got extra weapons and ammo?
<s> Home of the Brave.
<s> I can't make it.
<s> We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!
<s> I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
<s> We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
<s> Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --
<s> We can explain, Colonel.
<s> Boxin'.
<s> Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
<s> Tell me something, Dorie.  A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?
<s> You too, 'Mam.
<s> But you're in the U.S. Army, how could you --
<s> Of course I forgive you.  I know what you feel for Danny is real.  And your choice is your choice.
<s> The Americans themselves have made it possible.  We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.
<s> I've already got some in. I was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight.  How would you like that?
<s> That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
<s> I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
<s> Peggy Sue!
<s> We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
<s> Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
<s> What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
<s> You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.
<s> Charlie...
<s> I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them.
<s> I know. Put Scott through college.
<s> Charlie! Am I dead?
<s> Who?
<s> Let's go down to the basement.
<s> You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
<s> And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
<s> Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
<s> That's real big of you.
<s> I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
<s> You're going to listen to me.
<s> Right here. Now sit down.
<s> You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!
<s> Of course.
<s> I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
<s> What about Janet?
<s> Take a long walk on a short pier.
<s> That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.
<s> She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth?
<s> Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
<s> I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
<s> Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
<s> Mom, is there any coffee left?
<s> At my age? Don't be silly.
<s> Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
<s> That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
<s> I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of.
<s> We'll make it, we'll be fine.
<s> Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
<s> What about?
<s> It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
<s> I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
<s> Way to go, Mom!
<s> Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
<s> I'm just happy to see you.
<s> I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
<s> Why not? They're my favorite.
<s> But accidents can happen.
<s> Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
<s> What was?
<s> Are you doing some kind of science project?
<s> Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.
<s> Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
<s> Am I dead or not?
<s> Richard, take it easy.
<s> High tech. I like the sound of that.
<s> That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
<s> That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
<s> Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
<s> You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.
<s> Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
<s> Did you break up with Charlie?
<s> Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.
<s> The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church".  Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
<s> Pretty much so.
<s> There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes.
<s> Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea.
<s> Oh, you know... drink beer, tell ghost stories. They try and spook each other out, talking about zombies and things...  It's no big deal, Chase. I did it when I was young.
<s> I had a little run-in with Zowie.
<s> Nothing. I just got spooked by a bunch of furballs.
<s> I'm not hungry.
<s> He did. We buried him.  There's a place out in the woods... if you bury something there, it comes back alive.
<s> All set.
<s> Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud that you are.
<s> Zowie.
<s> He pissed me off.
<s> Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?
<s> You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule...
<s> Maybe it takes a while...
<s> I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
<s> All the time.
<s> I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again.
<s> Bob...
<s> Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?
<s> I am relaxed.
<s> Of course.
<s> I'm seeing him this afternoon.
<s> He's upset, he's sorry.
<s> Charles, I must apologize again, for the Kronos mishap.  It was a scary few minutes around here. Wow. But thank God, the complaint was found. And no damage was done.
<s> I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
<s> Uh huh...
<s> What happens?
<s> Want to hear my favorite aria?
<s> Yes. On my torso.
<s> I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing.
<s> Not unnecessary ones.
<s> Yes.
<s> I'll rephrase.  Did you have anything to do with this file being... misplaced?
<s> I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater?
<s> Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about AIDS, we're talking about lesions. Let's <u>see</u> what we're talking about.
<s> Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
<s> That's correct.
<s> I may have said something like that. But that's not how I feel at this moment.
<s> It satisfied me.
<s> Yes, character. To the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job.
<s> Not especially.
<s> Fine, Joe.
<s> That's perfectly clear.
<s> Very funny. I had a box of Pampers under my arm for Chrissake!
<s> Tell Iris all about it.  Take good care of Mrs. Finley, Iris.  Beckett, come in.
<s> Any women on board?
<s> Jesus.
<s> ... It's time to get this society back on track!
<s> The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight.
<s> You scare me, Riddick. That's what you wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it, Can I get back to work now?
<s> What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.
<s> You sure you can keep --
<s> We can't make it.
<s> I can't....I can't....
<s> Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
<s> I know what's in here!
<s> Not sure. Ten?
<s> Hey, who?
<s> Big Evil?
<s> Only around humans.
<s> Probably right.
<s> Let's just be sure.
<s> <u>We're gonna find the body</u>, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.
<s> Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.
<s> For your own fear.
<s> I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype?  Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.
<s> -- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
<s> What, you're goin' off, too?
<s> He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
<s> And there wasn't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! <u>That's</u> how they train you! On a fucking simulator!
<s> You know who Muhammad was?
<s> Riddick?
<s> And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
<s> Rain.
<s> Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
<s> I'm born-again.
<s> We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
<s> Said "looks clear."
<s> Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you.
<s> Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
<s> You still don't believe me, do you?
<s> No one really knows. It's an ancient taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.
<s> And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
<s> No.
<s> Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
<s> No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
<s> There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
<s> Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.
<s> Blessed are the vegetarians.
<s> Very well. I suggest we go and look at them.
<s> Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned.
<s> Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
<s> Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.
<s> He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
<s> Forget it. Abandon ship.
<s> We're here to stay.
<s> What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
<s> Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --
<s> I'll start by following the shoreline.  And my nose.
<s> By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
<s> With one of them.
<s> I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
<s> I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
<s> When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
<s> Cease fire! Withdraw!
<s> Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find.
<s> Shhhh!
<s> Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
<s> Yes, Sir.
<s> But there's the doll, sir.
<s> ...everybody gotta die sometime Red... Get back to your foxhole.
<s> That reminds me, I gotta take a shit.
<s> Fuck that redneck noise, dude. All dem chicks be rappin' how dey losin' der' ho's and how dey ain't got no bread for beer. Fuck dat honky shit. Got to get me some motown jams, dig it?
<s> Fuck this shit! I ain't dyin' in no white man's war! Ise didi-ing this motherfuckah!
<s> Then what do you suggest big shot?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Dawn...
<s> ...don't feel like it either.
<s> This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot. This man Chris been resurrected...
<s> Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking...
<s> Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US.
<s> I remember first time you came in here Taylor you telling me how much you admired that bastard.
<s> Barnes took a bullet right there. At Ia Drang Valley...  And the cocksucker SURVIVED - that's BAAAD man. That's his high, baby. High on WAR!
<s> Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.
<s> Well..
<s> 
<s> I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
<s> How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
<s> Immigration Officer?
<s> I see.
<s> You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
<s> You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
<s> On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
<s> Bad enough.
<s> That's putting it mildly.
<s> He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
<s> All right--following me.
<s> Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
<s> You leave it.
<s> I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
<s> That's right.
<s> He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money.
<s> And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
<s> And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
<s> I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.
<s> You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
<s> What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
<s> They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
<s> To do what?
<s> I've been a soldier too.  There is a difference.  A policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.
<s> We know everything.
<s> I hope he can prove it.  Come on. You don't want to get pneumonia.
<s> This way.
<s> I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.
<s> You mentioned information.
<s> Charlie's suits me fine. I don't scare.
<s> Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
<s> I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
<s> Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something, I know less than I did before.  Well, I may as well knock off for tonight.  Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation.
<s> If it doesn't take too long.  Drink?
<s> Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
<s> Sardonic, if you will my dear. Bust nasty. You lied about the gun.
<s> Let me know when you've identified him
<s> I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
<s> Go live in a tent.
<s> One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
<s> I've met her.
<s> Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.
<s> So?
<s> If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
<s> Did we ever really think it was suicide?
<s> And a motive--which we haven't got.  So this could all be a dream.
<s> Positive?
<s> Not quiet yet.
<s> I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
<s> It was Clarendon.  He knew I had the gun in my bag.
<s> Mortar shells are not funny, either.
<s> Not if it clears the air.
<s> Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
<s> We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
<s> What are my orders, sir?
<s> Yes.
<s> No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
<s> Yes, please.
<s> Thank you.
<s> No, it's all right.  I can get a cab.  Night night.
<s> I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
<s> You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian.
<s> I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.
<s> I bet.  Thanks for the drink.
<s> No.  We talked about history, and Siberian Geese.
<s> Why not.
<s> We were just chortling over that. Blasé and epicene.  It perfectly describes the new Foreign Secretary. So--I hope you don't mind, Edward, I pinched it for my piece today.
<s> To the Fleet.
<s> Mmm...
<s> My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
<s> You're a piece of shit
<s> What about the Cromwells?
<s> I'm not here.
<s> Yes, you said.
<s> U-huh.
<s> Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
<s> Where?
<s> No, Bells Beach, Australia.
<s> Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
<s> Wild, ain't it?!  See, we exist on a higher plane, you and I.  We make our own rules.  Why be a servant of the law Johnny U... when you can be it's master?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Zero distortion, sir.
<s> Yeah, sure.  Why not?  You two screw-ups deserve each other. That's why I put you together in the first place.  Christ Pappas, you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind--
<s> Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers.
<s> The fucking punks are surfers.
<s> Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.
<s> Right here, partner.
<s> Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
<s> They took a left at the next light!
<s> We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
<s> Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!
<s> This gets better by the minute.
<s> You never were all that smart... let's go!!!
<s> They're getting better equipped every day.
<s> Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
<s> Now what, Dutch. You going to send your mystery guest an invitation?
<s> Hawkins?
<s> But I do know.  I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will...  Ah, the escargot.
<s> I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
<s> Sit... and spin.
<s> If you can figure it out, be my guest.
<s> What motel you staying at?
<s> What do you want it to be?  Vivian, my name's Vivian.
<s> For an hour.
<s> I never joke about money.
<s> Right.  So!  In town on business?
<s> Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
<s> Mmm, I could tell.
<s> I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.
<s> What?
<s> All right, two thousand.
<s> ... all right.  I'll meet you in the lobby.  But only cause you're paying me to.
<s> I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
<s> Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
<s> He died a long time ago.
<s> Shall we mingle?
<s> I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
<s> You won't.
<s> I'll guard them and you with my life.
<s> I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
<s> Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know.  That's the fun of it.
<s> It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
<s> Vivian...
<s> Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.
<s> Oh, god, what?
<s> Why?
<s> Let him answer.
<s> And I don't like what we've become.  I'll cover any losses you have on this one.  Now get out, you asshole!
<s> Viv... don't be stupid.  We're whores.
<s> I'm sorry, Viv'.  Carlos has been on my back.  Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'?
<s> Baby!  Rodeo Drive.
<s> Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be.
<s> No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
<s> Rent.  You're late.
<s> Will I like it?
<s> Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best.
<s> Me?
<s> You're not accompanying him to New York?
<s> I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
<s> It's okay.  Edward told me.  Your secret's safe with me.
<s> Aw, come on, Bill.  It's just business.
<s> You're a silly girl.
<s> I do not marry tonight.
<s> I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
<s> With pride. What can I do for you?
<s> Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
<s> Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
<s> Gently.
<s> You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
<s> I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.
<s> You never said anything about killing anyone.
<s> I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
<s> I thought I was going faster.
<s> Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
<s> Yes, some of the time. 
<s> But you don't know where he is.
<s> Where did you get that?
<s> Yeah. It's really good.
<s> Okay.
<s> My spy network has heard no such news.
<s> DEATH FIRST!!
<s> That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
<s> Light him.
<s> Have you ever considered piracy? You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.
<s> -- power too -- promise me that --
<s> Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.
<s> Again. Thank you.
<s> My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done.
<s> You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
<s> I would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you following me either --
<s> For the Princess?
<s> You've made your decision then7
<s> Australia.
<s> Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
<s> Nobody's hearing nothing!
<s> An hour.
<s> A little bit.
<s> I'll wait in the hall ...
<s> I'm Leo Bloom, I'm an accountant, I'm from Whitehall and Marks, I was sent here to do your books and I'm terribly sorry I caught you with the old lady. 
<s> Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there.
<s> Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
<s> I have hurt your feelings.
<s> Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
<s> Well, sir, it seems ...
<s> In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
<s> Where?  What?
<s> It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!
<s> Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
<s> You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
<s> You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
<s> Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her.  Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  Please don't jump on me.
<s> Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
<s> Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like.
<s> You found a flop!
<s> They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
<s> What???
<s> Really, I never dreamed ...
<s> We swear it!
<s> And we'll finish playing the Contessa and Rudolfo.
<s> I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.
<s> Wagner...
<s> What have you done, LSD?
<s> I told them we invaded England.
<s> In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
<s> Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
<s> How early?
<s> No one met her?
<s> You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
<s> Cash or check? For the cabin...
<s> I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
<s> Anyone at home?
<s> If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
<s> If she paid you well?
<s> Can I trade in my car and take another?
<s> How much?
<s> Five hundred.
<s> Teddy called.  Me... And my mother called to see if Teddy called. Oh, and your sister called to say she's going to Tucson to do some buying and she'll be gone the whole weekend and...
<s> I want to know if my sister is here.
<s> A good reason, I suppose.
<s> Huh?
<s> I hate tears. 
<s> It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
<s> I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
<s> Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.
<s> Where's the old highway?
<s> Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
<s> An hour! Or less!
<s> Without calling me?
<s> You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
<s> Hospital clean.
<s> Why not?
<s> When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
<s> This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
<s> No.
<s> I'll lick the stamps.
<s> I'm thinking of it.
<s> You have a vacancy?
<s> I have?
<s> Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
<s> You'd know, of course.
<s> What are you running away from?
<s> Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
<s> A son is a poor substitute for a lover. 
<s> Good night.
<s> Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
<s> At this hour?
<s> You must remember that bad business out there. About ten years ago...
<s> Have you two had breakfast?
<s> I suppose you want a cabin.
<s> Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this trip... ninety percent business... and he wants practically notarized receipts. I better sign in and get a receipt.
<s> Haven't any.
<s> Fine.
<s> Leave me alone!
<s> He wasn't out when you were there. He just wasn't answering the door in the dead of night... like some people do. This fellow lives like a hermit...
<s> This detective was out there and Norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.
<s> You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!
<s> Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
<s> Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
<s> Not so fast, Mrs. Buckley. That was your idea!
<s> But ... the dogs...
<s> Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
<s> It's Igor at the Wax Museum! You'll find your judge embalmed in wax! He's a statue of Voltaire, with all the other corpses! The whole place is a morgue -- do you hear? -- a morgue! 
<s> In the can.  The hoosegow! Mrs. Winton's little boy. The Pawk Avenue Wintons, you know ... and plenty of do-re-mi.  He's in the jail-house now ...
<s> I don't agree with you.
<s> It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create.  My footing is not too secure.
<s> The body of Joan Gale!
<s> What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
<s> You give me a pain!
<s> Well, I won't work on it from that angle.
<s> Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
<s> Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
<s> Nope, I'm through!
<s> Great! ... If he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on -- beat it. It's five o'clock. You need some sleep.
<s> Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
<s> Don't remember what day that was, do you?
<s> Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
<s> No foolin' -- any suspect?
<s> Hotcha! Saved, one job!
<s> Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.
<s> No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
<s> I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
<s> For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
<s> They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
<s> Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...
<s> Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
<s> You're insane.
<s> You did.
<s> Day or night?
<s> I'm heading out of town.
<s> Where to?
<s> Then you get it.  You'll understand.
<s> Well, I got to see her.
<s> What'd you do, Rose?
<s> Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
<s> Rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and I've already touched your titty...
<s> I said I wouldn't.
<s> Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
<s> Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
<s> All right, what do you know?
<s> In the kitchen drinking all the ice water in Glenville. She walked out here, she didn't go by the hotel.
<s> She's getting herself up to go out.
<s> I do wish you'd speak to Brother. It's true he's been looking at those horrible little books again.
<s> Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
<s> Oh, shut up, Buddy.
<s> What are they doing, Doll?
<s> Is that all?
<s> Here comes Daddy.
<s> It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
<s> Of course I recall Rose. In fact I've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half.
<s> A wonderful woman, boy.
<s> She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.
<s> Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
<s> Then... may I speak quite frankly with you, Mr. Hillyer?
<s> Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
<s> Yes, darlin', time will tell.
<s> You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
<s> She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.
<s> Trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! It's settled! And I must say we've been more than fair to you, Rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that!
<s> Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself.
<s> Oh, I don't know, I... I...
<s> I... I'll get the grits.
<s> Got yourself up?
<s> Well, it has buttons.
<s> Oh, anywhere downtown.
<s> Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!
<s> Oh, no, sir.
<s> Well, it's Billy.
<s> Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
<s> It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
<s> Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.
<s> That's correct -- outside it, not in it. As for the job, well, the Jewboy suppliers give me a lot of grief and we use a pile of niggers to haul and tote and they ain't worth a sorry-ass damn.  But I can build anything, Buddy. Give me the plans and I can build a goddamn staircase to the moon. It's a fact, I can build anything...  ... but she never believed that. Oh, hell, no, she never believed in me.
<s> She's te reason -- cured me of women once and for all. Oh, I got rid of her, Buddy, I didn't waste no time kickin' that bitch out. Hell, she was screwin' everybody in Savannah. I caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did I beat the everlastin' piss out of him!
<s> Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?
<s> You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.
<s> Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.
<s> It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth.
<s> Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
<s> Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
<s> You can stop it right now.
<s> Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it.
<s> Oh... oh... oh! I think... maybe... one of 'em... was Foster... but I don't hardly know him!
<s> It'll get better now.
<s> What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer?
<s> Maybe I'm not making myself clear. You're probably the first girl Billy-Boy's ever fallen in love with, and I know for sure you're the first he's slept with.  So, how's he gonna feel...  ... when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who didn't have to pull out at the last second to get his close-up?
<s> Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.
<s> What and?  That's what I got.
<s> I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
<s> Alright!  Alright... put me down...
<s> Lay off once, would you?
<s> Thank you, concerned citizen.
<s> Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right?  Let's talk about it.
<s> Welcome to Beverly Hills. Wife-swapping Capital of the World.
<s> Name one.
<s> Wha... ?
<s> What... what kinda thing is that to say?
<s> Bullshit.
<s> What was I supposed to do?
<s> We have to find Kittle.
<s> Till the last firework fizzles out tonight, detective, you sit a desk. And, after that, I'll decide if you keep your shield.
<s> It's our job.
<s> First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...
<s> All I'm saying is, your little Bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper couldn't get out.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> Okay, okay... hold on.  Don't go getting your panties in a knot...
<s> Nothing's broke.  Keep sewing.  And quit pacing, you big ox.  You're making me skittish.
<s> You mean, besides the warrant out on us for blowing up our commanding officer?
<s> Seatbelts fastened, please.
<s> Know what I love about dynamite?
<s> Yeah.
<s> That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.
<s> The way Zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling "escort service" of yours, I figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.
<s> You cannot escape your destiny.
<s> Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
<s> There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
<s> Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Here's the terminal.
<s> All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.
<s> No, wait! I thought you were blind!
<s> All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?
<s> You, too.
<s> I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
<s> Oh, no.
<s> Just...images, really. Feelings.
<s> Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
<s> But, why must you confront him?
<s> Never-r-r!
<s> No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
<s> Your father he is.
<s> I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
<s> You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
<s> Made me give you the eye And then panic,
<s> But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
<s> And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
<s> So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
<s> And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
<s> Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
<s> Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
<s> Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
<s> You're too kind.
<s> Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
<s> My mother told me just the opposite. She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.'
<s> ...I suppose.
<s> ...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
<s> 'Cause you can't sing or dance?
<s> ...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
<s> Could ya take off that hat.
<s> I'll be waiting.
<s> Yes.
<s> ...What?
<s> What're we going to do?
<s> Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.
<s> You's the novelty, Champ!
<s> Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!!
<s> Don't play with this man, he's fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel some real heat!
<s> ...Thanks.
<s> ...It's very American.
<s> Does that bum have to say that?
<s> Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
<s> This guy is beautiful -- get the Cokes.
<s> Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
<s> I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.
<s> Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?
<s> Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
<s> I'm gonna do somethin with it.
<s> Black market?
<s> Where else am I gonna go.  Bet three grand on Rocky.
<s> What'd you say?
<s> You think everybody I fight is a bum.
<s> ...No.
<s> When was they here?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Breathe deep -- Keep ya chin down!! Use the legs and drive through 'im. Attack -- Attack -- Attack!
<s> ...The guy's great.
<s> Looks, huh?
<s> My sister's a friggin' loser.
<s> Try again, c'mon, try again.
<s> ...It's cold outside, Paulie.
<s> Creed's great, ain't he... I'll do what I can.
<s> You serve martinis, doncha?
<s> Well, I'll be...
<s> Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
<s> You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
<s> I'll bet.
<s> Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
<s> Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
<s> The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
<s> They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
<s> What the hell's a freeway?
<s> Look, doll, if I wanted underwear, I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.
<s> That's because I don't have a doorbell.
<s> Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.
<s> Don't worry, you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
<s> Why didn't you tell me?
<s> No, you gotta understand, Valiant, I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed.  I just wanted to sell my studio.  But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.
<s> Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
<s> Why, you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
<s> I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
<s> But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
<s> Forget it.
<s> Hey, it's the will.  I, Marvin Acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters...
<s> [Aside to GREGORY] Is the law on our side, if I say ay?
<s> Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.
<s> Tush, thou art deceived. Hast thou no letters to me from the priest? [Balthsasr shakes his head no.] No matter. Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight. I will hence tonight.
<s> Then I'll leave thee.
<s> Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! O, Romeo that she were An open ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
<s> Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
<s> Romeo will answer it?
<s> By my head here come the Capulets.
<s> Art thou hurt?
<s> Go to! What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to; Make a mutiny among my guests?!
<s> I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
<s> My leisure serves me, pensive daughter now. We must entreat the time alone.
<s> If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
<s> Romeo, come forth.
<s> She'll not come down tonight.
<s> What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
<s> Amen
<s> If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
<s> Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
<s> Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
<s> Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
<s> Ay me!
<s> If my heart's dear love--
<s> The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
<s> Thus..... with a kiss...... I die.
<s> Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
<s> NO! Mercutio!
<s> How do we know that?
<s> Exactly.  Gregor, he was the Russian's man.  It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it.  Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral.  Gregor must've got to Swede...
<s> There's a problem...
<s> Don't do it, Sam!
<s> Not so fast.  Who's that?
<s> I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
<s> Of course.  Don't you?
<s> Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
<s> Forgive my intrusion into your affairs, but I am the one who connected Vincent to this job, his agent, if you will.  He is one of my oldest friends and I owe him a great debt, much like the debt I suspect he owes you.
<s> Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.
<s> Did he bring that with him?
<s> What a surprise...
<s> Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
<s> What makes you think we're here to meet you?
<s> And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?
<s> I asked if we could give him anything else.
<s> Like Larry or Swede.
<s> They'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in New York, and it would still get fucked up.
<s> You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened.  This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody...  Including you...
<s> I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
<s> This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
<s> I know.  Jean-Pierre did.
<s> Because I owe you.  Look at that...
<s> If our positions were reversed, would you leave me?
<s> I think not.
<s> Why?  You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia...  And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.
<s> Do you have a good answer?
<s> What?
<s> You slept with the fucker!!
<s> You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
<s> Hey Dwayne why don't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin?
<s> Looks like some kind of drug deal or something, they're not from around here --  one of them's still alive.
<s> I want to get some hounds down here.
<s> I don't know what you're -
<s> I probably would have.  I guess the clues damn near before everyone.
<s> What do you mean what are we going to do?
<s> Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!
<s> Torch it?!
<s> I don't know.
<s> All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
<s> All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
<s> I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --
<s> Yes I DO!  It never woulda stopped, you know that.  Jesse's always gonna be making mistakes and we'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives.
<s> He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
<s> It's NOT too late!
<s> We're going to wait.  All of us, until everything dies down.
<s> I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
<s> I know.
<s> It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
<s> I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
<s> Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
<s> What did he buy?
<s> How about you give us what you have and leave.
<s> First you question my integrity, then you call me stupid...  ...that hurts, son.
<s> I wanted to ask you some questions about last night.
<s> Damn! MARTIN I'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that.  I thought maybe it would help. Booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- Earl immediately plays up to Martin, clearly relieved --
<s> Fine.  The information doesn't leave this room.
<s> So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
<s> Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
<s> Dammit you’re persistent.  I don’t want to listen to this anymore.  No more bets with you.
<s> Sort of.
<s> Yeah whaddya want?.
<s> Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
<s> Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
<s> Yeah let's hear about your day.
<s> Stop!  Stop!  I don't need the money.  You can have it all.
<s> Hi.
<s> And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.
<s> Yep, fifteen thousand BTU's, enough to cool off this whole place.
<s> Yeah.  Figured you could have it.
<s> You've done without it long enough, ma.
<s> Absolutely positively.
<s> That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
<s> I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests.
<s> Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
<s> One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week.  I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing.  Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills.  I knew something was wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared.  The whole thing.  And they checked out. 100%.
<s> This is your ship?
<s> It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
<s> I said get on your feet!
<s> It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself, inspector.
<s> Lee, you okay?
<s> That's right.
<s> Oh yes, she's very nice.
<s> Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
<s> Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!
<s> Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.
<s> Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
<s> Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
<s> I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
<s> How the hell did Tan get away with it?
<s> IT IS CRAZY!
<s> Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
<s> Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
<s> Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
<s> What did you say?
<s> Gimme the binoculars.
<s> She's walking back towards the door.
<s> We can help you.  I'm a detective in Hong Kong.
<s> I am not third world ugly.  Women like me, they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.
<s> What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.
<s> No kung pao chicken.  Never.
<s> Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
<s> That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.
<s> Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
<s> Dancing?
<s> No.  I'm going to find out.
<s> Carter...
<s> It's okay.  I can finally let it go.
<s> It's okay, I got lots more.
<s> This money is evidence.
<s> New York City?
<s> Why don't you go get them?
<s> Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
<s> That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The detective in charge of our investigation.
<s> Don't push it. You better watch your ass with these Fed types. If there's a screw-up, they won't think twice about burnin' it.
<s> This is pathetic.
<s> I know a shortcut.
<s> No.
<s> Don't go there...
<s> Yes. He was part of the Juntao crime family. He may be Juntao himself.  And he dropped this.
<s> Juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. There were never witnesses.
<s> Yeah, it's good.
<s> Good God, ya'll!
<s> I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
<s> Oh yes.
<s> What?
<s> Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee.
<s> Carter, shut up!
<s> Nobody touches me.
<s> How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
<s> You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
<s> Ambassador Han.
<s> Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
<s> Don't worry, he's with Carter.
<s> Let me take you back inside, okay?
<s> Maintain eye contact.
<s> What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
<s> God bless you, Maggie.
<s> Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
<s> I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
<s> Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
<s> Oh yeah!  I happen to know from reliable sources that Nietzche got expenses and a rental car.
<s> Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do.
<s> She's a cacophony of contradictions.
<s> Looking for Maggie.
<s> That must have made you proud.
<s> Twice...
<s> You can turn that finger around.
<s> Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
<s> Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
<s> Or the sexual habits of locusts?
<s> Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
<s> With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
<s> No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
<s> I'd rather not.
<s> I kissed him back.
<s> I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
<s> They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
<s> It's probably because you got him fired.
<s> He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  He's an attractive man.
<s> I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
<s> See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.
<s> No sauntering down the aisle.  Just make time.  Let's just get there.
<s> Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.
<s> So you're angry.  Big deal.
<s> Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
<s> Don't be silly.  I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
<s> Happy New Year.
<s> Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
<s> No.
<s> I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
<s> Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
<s> I always wondered about that too.
<s> You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
<s> Well, it's the same woman.  And he was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle.
<s> No, I'm not. 
<s> Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--
<s> I know.
<s> And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb.  If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --
<s> Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
<s> Howard.
<s> We'll move them --
<s> Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.
<s> Like... clockwork.
<s> Grace heard it.
<s> And if I could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show.  But what the hell.  It's not one specific thing.  It's more of a feeling. 
<s> Why not?
<s> Yeah.
<s> I don't know --
<s> Right, right.
<s> Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.
<s> Seventy... eight.
<s> Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
<s> This is going to be tougher than I thought.
<s> I don't know.  Do I?
<s> Oh, you're changing your mind --
<s> Stressed.
<s> You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
<s> The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
<s> This is the one I like.
<s> This conversation is finished.
<s> Goddammit, I am sick of this --
<s> I was scared of what you were gonna do.
<s> If I didn't go.
<s> No.
<s> Well...
<s> Microwave.  Five minutes.
<s> No thanks.
<s> No. My name is Quintero. Mister Quintero.
<s> You can't send him back to Oklahoma. It'd be inhumane.
<s> You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
<s> You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
<s> Yes. We will light the candles.
<s> No. No. I can't. If Ramón ever found me on a picket line ...
<s> Good. Come in, we'll work it out. Sit down, sit down.
<s> What's more important than sanitation?
<s> All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
<s> Never... never... never!
<s> It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
<s> He'll have it good. Some day.
<s> The union don't run my house.  Those Anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves -- but you don't see any of them down there.
<s> I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
<s> No, no ... we wouldn't do it.
<s> Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
<s> Sun up.
<s> Aah! They've got other mines. You don't see the larger picture.  They've got millions. Millions. They can outlast us, and they know it.
<s> I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Will you be still?
<s> But honey ...
<s> Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."
<s> It's Mama's Saint's Day.
<s> I don't want you hanging around there, hear?
<s> You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
<s> He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
<s> That's it?
<s> Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.
<s> Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ... 
<s> Why? The guys is ready to deal now.
<s> Colette ...
<s> And you admire that?
<s> I try.
<s> What is wrong with you?
<s> Therapy session is over.
<s> It's me.
<s> You can still work.
<s> I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.
<s> Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
<s> I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
<s> Oh ... that.  Ah, he was just juiced. He wouldn't have did nothin'
<s> You on a roll?
<s> I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.
<s> Can you set that up?
<s> You aren't coming with me.
<s> Secret recipe.
<s> Hey, I don't play that.
<s> Okay! Okay!
<s> Well, you know what they say, just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat.
<s> Just the way the world works.  Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.
<s> Tell me what?
<s> Question is, what are you doing here?
<s> Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.
<s> I'm afraid so, Danny.
<s> What?!
<s> Who the hell is Jimmy?
<s> That would be me.
<s> Several possession charges, but nothing major.
<s> Thank you.  Thank you very much.
<s> I thought you were done.
<s> Thank you, sir.
<s> In West Fork?
<s> Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
<s> Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother.
<s> Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
<s> Of course, sir.
<s> You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
<s> Good, now get your goddamned gear.
<s> Pass.
<s> You think the rest of us were?
<s> You know classical music?
<s> Where are you from, Captain?
<s> Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
<s> Okay, Wade.  Translators?
<s> Hell of a mission.
<s> They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
<s> Nope.
<s> You're kidding yourself.
<s> Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
<s> Is it getting worse?
<s> About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.
<s> And what about your own hand?
<s> Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
<s> Stay at it until you get fire control.  Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.
<s> There's to be a bright side, look for it.
<s> Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.
<s> Sure, what do you want to know?
<s> Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
<s> You have orders, too.
<s> Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
<s> That's a mystery to me.
<s> What if our guys open up, sir?
<s> I coach the baseball team, too.
<s> That's not where I am.  Miller No? Where are you?
<s> Struggling with a pair of Germans.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
<s> Lingerie.
<s> Get lost.
<s> It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...
<s> Don't let your father's business infect your life.
<s> Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 
<s> Excellent.
<s> I hope you understand.
<s> I admit nothing.
<s> Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.
<s> I am.
<s> I dream about it.
<s> One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
<s> I'm going to take out Diane Court again.
<s> I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
<s> Oh yeah!
<s> Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours.  Go ahead, open it.
<s> I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me.  I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.
<s> Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
<s> No, no, just listen.  You won the Wreath  fellowship.
<s> No, listen to me.  You're the best in the country, don't you understand?  It's like a pyramid.  It starts out with everybody, and it narrows through your life and through everything, and all the hoopla and the competition narrows it down to one brilliant person who is so special that they celebrate you on two continents.  And it's you.  So tell me something, where's the flaw in that?  There is no flaw.
<s> Dad.
<s> Dad, I'm so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.
<s> You're going.
<s> Swear to god.
<s> Alright.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Goodbye.
<s> Or, or I could always wear this one.
<s> You think so?
<s> I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.
<s> I'll see you there.  Bye.
<s> I'm doing alright.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Yes.  Are you shaking?
<s> Your letter came yesterday.
<s> Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
<s> I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...
<s> We decided...
<s> I think that we should stop going out on dates.
<s> No I didn't.
<s> You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
<s> Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
<s> Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
<s> Hello.  May I please speak with Diane please?
<s> Uh... okay... um...
<s> I'm incarcerated, Lloyd!  I don't deserve to lose my daughter over this.  I don't deserve to have you as my go-between.  And I can't for the life of me figure out how she could choose to champion in mediocrity the way she flirts around you.
<s> No way.
<s> Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
<s> Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
<s> Yeah, alright.
<s> War.
<s> Good.
<s> Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do?  You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done.  Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example.  But that's good business.
<s> Look -
<s> You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.
<s> That's great, thanks.
<s> How should I know?  It's broken. See what you can do.
<s> Wine?
<s> Do what?
<s> Oskar -
<s> Are you losing money?
<s> What other point is -
<s> I think it's too late.
<s> They're withholding payment.
<s> No, no, what, what is it?
<s> There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that.  He's taking money.
<s> The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
<s> Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
<s> What is it?
<s> Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
<s> That's okay.
<s> Where is everybody?
<s> That's too bad.
<s> What if I said you?
<s> Can we talk?
<s> Please, Cotton, don’t do this.
<s> You have a right to be angry.
<s> I'll get my jacket.
<s> What guy?
<s> Until now.
<s> Hope you’re ready, Sid. We got one last surprise for you.
<s> Just for you, Sid.
<s> Miss Weathers.
<s> Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
<s> No, I'm the one who's sorry. I misjudged you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some oozing to do.
<s> I know that.
<s> ..and as lonely as I am...
<s> And Joel's pre-med.
<s> Let's find out.
<s> No, wait here.
<s> There's nothing. I'm coming down.
<s> Just in case...
<s> Whatever.
<s> I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that...
<s> Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.
<s> But who would operate your camera?
<s> Where is your attacker?
<s> Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
<s> No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.
<s> Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised.
<s> But she's standing right next to you.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Well ya got me. That's me. I'm Ben Damon.
<s> Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?
<s> That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
<s> Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
<s> I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.
<s> I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
<s> I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
<s> All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
<s> Catch him, or kill him.
<s> What does this have to do with Sid?
<s> Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
<s> I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid! The killer's looking for you! Quick untie me!
<s> Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
<s> Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
<s> Someone stole Sid's file?
<s> Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
<s> Sid, this is detective Kincaid.
<s> Just Jennifer.  And you.
<s> Do you want us to come with you?
<s> Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
<s> Need to get in that building?
<s> Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
<s> GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set!  No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here.
<s> I'll call you, when you're on your way.
<s> You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro.
<s> It's good to see you again Sidney. I was growing real impatient. Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.
<s> Well then the people you need to call are the police.
<s> So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
<s> Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
<s> I'll only stay a sec.
<s> Is it the sex thing? Am I being too pushy?
<s> Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
<s> Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy.
<s> You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
<s> Really? What?
<s> Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
<s> Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
<s> NO, YOU LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BITCH. IF YOU HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE A FISH. UNDERSTAND?
<s> They'd never make it in time.
<s> Sure...
<s> I believe you...
<s> Turn off the light.
<s> NOOOO....
<s> Please go away! Leave us alone!
<s> You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
<s> Deputy... good evening.
<s> Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything...
<s> Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
<s> And my Dad? Any word on him?
<s> Afraid not.
<s> Yes, sir, sheriff.
<s> Keeping my eye on Sidney.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> I told you to send it back.
<s> Jesus! The camera-hurry!
<s> You want to go live?
<s> When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
<s> What's the delay?
<s> Forget it.
<s> Maybe she's a slut just like her mom.
<s> And it fucked her up royally. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression.
<s> So where are you?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Can you knock?
<s> Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
<s> Working, thank you.
<s> She's the Scream Queen.
<s> Don't shoot. It's me.
<s> The why'd the police let him go?
<s> Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
<s> They think it's school-related?
<s> I'm not worried.
<s> Oh, god...
<s> He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.
<s> With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.
<s> During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." It's a real turn on.
<s> Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..."
<s> Deal.
<s> For once, Stu, drop it.
<s> Tits -- see.
<s> Ease back, Mills.
<s> I thought you might want to be filled in.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Where was the girl?
<s> It's not too far away now.
<s> David... please...
<s> Her pretty head.
<s> You'll see.
<s> Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
<s> Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
<s> I realize that.
<s> No one yet.
<s> Detective Mills here.  Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back...  What?  Why?
<s> I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
<s> Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
<s> Like, because someone's holding a gun on you.
<s> Bear with me.
<s> Just wait!
<s> It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
<s> It's a fine line between insane and inspired.
<s> And so what?
<s> Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.
<s> Let's go.
<s> I'm fine.
<s> I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.
<s> If we get him, I'll be happy enough.
<s> I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days.  You'd be doing me the favor.
<s> What are you talking about?  What happened?
<s> Oh... um, William.
<s> It surprises me.  It really does.
<s> I'm sorry, I only...
<s> Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
<s> Crime of passion.
<s> This is a done deal.  All but the paperwork.
<s> I don't know.
<s> An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
<s> Why don't you finish the job?
<s> Dunno...Seems so.
<s> I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
<s> You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?
<s> ...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
<s> Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
<s> I'm Clayton.
<s> Grab hold!...
<s> I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...
<s> Ay-eh...That's jest what I tole Joe Powers...That un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, Ethan?
<s> Ethan...I found a man's seen her... knows where little Debbie is!
<s> Seven Fingers...ay-eh...Seven...
<s> You got it with you?
<s> Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
<s> Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
<s> An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...Then he quits...Same when he runs...Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that...We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
<s> I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...
<s> He just couldn't wait...
<s> Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
<s> Cut it out, will ya...
<s> Look!  Scar?...  Do you know where he went? And if he has a girl with him...a <U>white</U> girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo...
<s> Nine...  Ten!
<s> Never heard of him...
<s> Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
<s> It's what I'm countin' on.
<s> You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
<s> Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
<s> <U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!
<s> You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
<s> It still worked in town.
<s> Do you have a better idea?
<s> My father was a pilot.  And do I know how to fly?
<s> I just had a really strange experience.
<s> What?
<s> Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.
<s> In the village.  Look what I found.
<s> Damn it, look at you!  Don't you see what's happening with you?  We need to get out of here, don't you understand?  Out of this house!
<s> There is, of course, another possible explanation which I dearly hope is not the case.
<s> A tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and, thus, influence your perception.
<s> Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?
<s> Not so bad, if I could get some peace and quiet around here.
<s> Locked safe in here. I leave the scene in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a sonnet to write.
<s> The speech is excellent.  "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible.
<s> The title won't do.
<s> Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
<s> Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.
<s> Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline.
<s> The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
<s> On my mother's side the Ardens
<s> Yes, I saw it.
<s> Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
<s> Very well.
<s> Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.
<s> Nobody knew!
<s> it will be all right, madam.
<s> Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.
<s> We are about to embark on a great voyage.
<s> Go on.
<s> I thought your play was for Burbage.
<s> "Is the day so young?"
<s> Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
<s> Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?
<s> "Madam!"
<s> I would have made you immortal.  Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare.
<s> No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.
<s> "What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
<s> I like her.
<s> Oh. What is your name?
<s> Then kiss me again for I am not mistook.
<s> There is.
<s> Oh, but it will end well for love?
<s> You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
<s> Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
<s> Virginia?!
<s> Does she say so?
<s> Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
<s> It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come, there is no harm in a drink.
<s> On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
<s> I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
<s> Will you shut up and play.
<s> I don't have time to discuss it now. I don't care so long as he's not a freak.
<s> It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...
<s> He couldn't get his car started.
<s> You call them if you want.
<s> We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
<s> Can we talk about something?
<s> Just stop worrying.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I don't know.
<s> You're sure? There's lots more.
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good --
<s> I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.
<s> I don't know anything about it.
<s> And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
<s> I see.
<s> Yes, thanks.
<s> Cameron?
<s> OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love.
<s> Just serve.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
<s> Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from?
<s> Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
<s> It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.
<s> You were magnificent.
<s> Be like a weight off your shoulders.
<s> Oh, good.
<s> Where he can't get it?
<s> I'll wait there.
<s> Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
<s> Oh, shut up, Alex.
<s> Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
<s> Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
<s> You're sure of that.
<s> No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet.
<s> No.
<s> It was on the television.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> A priest who dies.
<s> Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
<s> No.
<s> A certain weakness.
<s> Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
<s> I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
<s> Yes, sweetheart, shh.
<s> I gotta talk to you.
<s> What?
<s> I don't want to place you in any position --
<s> What kind of treatment?
<s> You're looking great, baby.
<s> Nobody can hear it.
<s> Hello.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I never get my hair done.
<s> Look...  Do you wanna fuck me?
<s> They are?
<s> Buffums?
<s> -- Yeah... your car down here?
<s> I'd cut it...
<s> No, I'm sure.
<s> Okay.
<s> Yeah... wow.
<s> Do you? You still see him?
<s> Did I what?
<s> You did, I know you did.
<s> I don't want to... I swear...
<s> -- oh I thought you were --
<s> -- mmm --
<s> Why?
<s> She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
<s> -- oh -- sweetheart...
<s> -- please, please forgive me...
<s> -- c'mon, I'll get you home...
<s> That's too bad.
<s> No shit?
<s> We live together now.
<s> Neither do I, baby.
<s> Look at the way I live.
<s> -- what?  -- I'll see you later...
<s> Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
<s> ... honest. At least you're honest with me.
<s> Yes it is.
<s> You're right.
<s> When?
<s> Well, what?
<s> Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
<s> Oh yeah...
<s> What?
<s> Wasn't sure it was you.
<s> No.
<s> You do?
<s> I'm not jealous of the dogs.
<s> Aren't you going to have one?
<s> Why not?
<s> Jesus, she's my best friend.
<s> Who is that?
<s> Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
<s> Don't be silly.
<s> Well, it's George.
<s> Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
<s> But you have problems?
<s> Honey?
<s> Sure.
<s> I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
<s> -- never mind.
<s> -- no.
<s> Of course not.
<s> Sure thing, Mr. Karpf. C'mon.
<s> Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.
<s> Yes, Dad.
<s> Yes, Dad.
<s> Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
<s> Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
<s> Okay.
<s> Okay, Mom.
<s> Okay, Mom.
<s> Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
<s> Danny... what's the matter, hon?
<s> Are you having a bad dream?
<s> Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
<s> Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
<s> Does Tony ever tell you to do things?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained.  They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again.
<s> Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
<s> Ah he dislocated his shoulder.
<s> That's right, sir.
<s> And, er... where are they now?
<s> Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance.
<s> Hallo.  My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.
<s> Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
<s> No problem, Mr. Ullman.  I was just getting to the ice cream.
<s> God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
<s> Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
<s> Good evening Mr. Torrance.
<s> Hi, hon.  How's it going?
<s> Uh...huh.
<s> Yes.
<s> Absolutely nothing.  How is he?
<s> I think he did it to himself.
<s> Yes.
<s> How do you like it?
<s> Jack...
<s> Why?
<s> Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.
<s> Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
<s> Oh fine.  Well in view of all the ground that we to cover today, I suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away.
<s> Uncle Al-
<s> Blue. This blue.
<s> A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
<s> What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
<s> Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
<s> What's that?
<s> Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah, I know. It's great!
<s> There! You see!
<s> The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
<s> Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
<s> But Uncle Al! You said-
<s> Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  Go on, now.
<s> Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
<s> Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I do.
<s> Vince...
<s> I feel sorry for you, Vincent.  And I forgive you.
<s> What is it, Betty?
<s> I haven't heard that song in ages.  The Ronettes?
<s> Why?
<s> I love my heddles.  Show me again.
<s> Sure is!  Come on in, and sing a spell.
<s> Mary Clarence, could you?  Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but...  Could you help us?
<s> That man -- who is he?
<s> This is so exhilarating!  All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.
<s> I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on earth, but I loved it.  This place is a Hilton.
<s> Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
<s> Again!
<s> Are you sure?
<s> Now stop that.  You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience.  I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if she understood.
<s> Give me a C.  A C!
<s> Again?
<s> Of course.  But it's almost lunch.
<s> Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
<s> No food?
<s> Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough.  I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age.  I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.
<s> But you can't kick me out!  Guys want to kill me!  You're a nun!  A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep?  I mean, I'm a major sinner!  All-time great!  Hall of Fame!  Aren't I, like, your dream come true?  Your Olympic event?
<s> A what? When are you qonna wake up?
<s> Okay -- no limo.
<s> She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
<s> Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career opportunity.
<s> Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
<s> Me too.
<s> You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
<s> You won't even tell us?
<s> Where is she?
<s> Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.  Sharp.
<s> We're losing it.
<s> We can't leave it up to the Feds!
<s> Yes?
<s> Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
<s> But where?
<s> Your small convent is in danger of closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas Police Department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
<s> I love you, Chris.  I always will.  I gave you so much.  My time.  My affection.  A big-time career.  And how do you repay me?  What's the thanks I get?  Where's the loyalty, huh?  Where's the love?
<s> She's acting weird, Vince.  Ever since we picked her up.
<s> Find 'em!
<s> Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town.  What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am I to starve to death?
<s> Two days... ?  For murder?
<s> I was afraid of this.
<s> To place it inside its coffin.
<s> Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
<s> They need guidance.
<s> Pardon me?
<s> Have they nothing to fear presently?
<s> How could he?
<s> What kind of nuts?
<s> Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
<s> I have others.  All I need is this.
<s> What happened?
<s> Stay back.
<s> I need time for thinking.  Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.
<s> Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
<s> Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
<s> You made this, and the drawings?
<s> Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside.  Can't you see what is inexplicable?
<s> The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
<s> I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
<s> What troubles you?
<s> She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
<s> I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
<s> Come with me.
<s> And, what did he say?
<s> What did he say, Katrina?
<s> What would you have me believe?
<s> His horse.
<s> It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical.
<s> What... ?
<s> I can show exactly.
<s> Close your mouth!  Keep silent.
<s> She did not do it... please listen...
<s> Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
<s> Scooter, let's me and you go over to Dairy Queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime.
<s> Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
<s> He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
<s> How are you, Bill?
<s> Is him stayin' here workin' out?
<s> What you got that's good to eat?
<s> I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.
<s> It's too big.
<s> Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
<s> I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
<s> Please Doyle, don't.
<s> Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on.
<s> But honey, I'll be good. I promise. I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin' to help these two be part of things.
<s> Don't tell me what to do.
<s> Don't tell me what to do.
<s> I know Albert. We're friends.
<s> Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
<s> Come on, don't be a pussy. Everybody has to work.
<s> A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't understand all of it.
<s> I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.
<s> Frank, I just like you as a friend. Only at the secret place. Okay? I can't go there now. I'll see you later.
<s> You told me to come by.
<s> I don't want to worry your mama with company.
<s> I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
<s> He ort not to talk that away to you neither. He ain't no count. He's mean to you and your mama.  Yore mama and that feller that's carryin' me to get somethin' d'eat's gonna be back here directly.
<s> I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
<s> They ort to. You're a good boy.
<s> I've studied about it. The Bible says not to or you end up goin' to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.
<s> Yes sir, I reckon it does.
<s> Readin' on this book on how to work carpentry. I aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. I've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot. These drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far.  You seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might. You got somethin' wrong with ye?
<s> Make believin' always made me feel good too from time to time.
<s> That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
<s> Did Karl go to bed?
<s> We've had a real hard life, too, Mama.
<s> Yes, I guess you are.
<s> I never was no good with history.
<s> That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.
<s> I'll be dog.
<s> Okay.
<s> So, you're really going to stay here?
<s> I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
<s> I know.
<s> I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.
<s> I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.
<s> I wouldn't actually call it a party. It's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday.  The guest list is quite restricted. So far, there's Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept, that would make three of us.
<s> Three's a crowd. Yes, I'm aware of that. But I have to keep an eye on Mr. Benjamin wherever he goes. To make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble.
<s> It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
<s> Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
<s> It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
<s> I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here.
<s> Huh?
<s> For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
<s> Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
<s> It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.
<s> I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman.  Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby.
<s> It can be arranged. Seeing as how I've read your books. I don't see why I shouldn't share my pictures with you.  It would be an honor.
<s> It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
<s> Yeah, that's what I'd recommend. You know how it is. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, time creeps on its petty pace.
<s> It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling.
<s> It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
<s> That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away.
<s> Nothing much. He said his socks and underpants were dirty, and would we mind driving up with his things.  Fucking kids, huh? They take you for granted every time.
<s> It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.
<s> Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
<s> I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
<s> You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
<s> It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
<s> Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
<s> Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.
<s> I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
<s> Bully for you.
<s> For keeps.
<s> Anything, Auggie. Just name it.
<s> I almost got married once.
<s> She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.
<s> It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
<s> This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?
<s> Sure, Auggie. I follow. When you don't know nothing, it's like paradise. I know what that is. It's after you're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels.
<s> I think I'll take them. 
<s> That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street.
<s> I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.
<s> Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
<s> You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
<s> Not a one.
<s> Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?
<s> Five dollars an hour?  I'll take it.
<s> That's how we met. We're members of the International Same Name Club. Believe it or not, there are 846 Paul Benjamins in America. But only two in the New York metropolitan area. That's how Paul and I got to be such good friends. We're the only ones who show up at the meetings.
<s> I don't got no daddy, you dig? I got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass.
<s> Help? What the fuck do I need your help for? I've got a man, don't I? That's more than you can say for yourself, Hawkeye.
<s> Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
<s> I mean breakfast.
<s> And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
<s> The what?
<s> I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
<s> I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.
<s> Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
<s> You don't really want to know.
<s> I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.
<s> Why don't you go to the police?
<s> If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
<s> What makes you think you'll be any safer around here? It's only about a mile away from where you live.
<s> Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
<s> No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
<s> Carl Heine's type.
<s> No, but as I say, the type is rare. Ten percent of Caucasian males.
<s> So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
<s> That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
<s> Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
<s> You done your math right.
<s> Unwritten rule of the sea.  We don't bother each other, stick to ourselves. Ask anybody.
<s> Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.
<s> You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
<s> Up in the air?  Was <u>that</u> your reaction?
<s> Look at my face.  It's the face of the people who did that.  My father hardly speaks English.  We're in bad trouble, you have to see that.
<s> There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.
<s> Look, I <u>want</u> to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again.
<s> Those aren't the facts that matter.
<s> So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
<s> And the next one...?
<s> And the last...?
<s> I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
<s> He said he didn't want that life no more.  He'd been saving to buy a farm.  He was sorry I got sick. But pretty excited to get back his father's place.
<s> Since September.  Last guys got transferred.
<s> Shorthard the radio transmis- sions, write 'em up, file 'em in a cabinet.  Nobody ever looks. Just take up space.
<s> Me and Smoltz came on dogwatch September 16.
<s> Three kids.  What's she going to do?
<s> Won't take two.
<s> That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
<s> But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
<s> You're wonderin'...how come I never ask.  If you did it.
<s> Possible.  But not darn likely.
<s> Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
<s> Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
<s> Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
<s> But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
<s> Such as?
<s> Get lost, will you?
<s> Bull fiddle.
<s> Clarinet - drums - trumpet - trombone -
<s> Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
<s> Those two musicians from the garage!
<s> Shut up, will you?  I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
<s> I thought you weren't talking to me.
<s> Yeah, that's what he means. Good old Nellie!  I ought to wring her neck!
<s> Now you're talking!  We pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine -
<s> I'll think of something.  Don't crowd me.
<s> As far away as possible.
<s> What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
<s> Now you've done it!
<s> Polish?
<s> You tore it again!
<s> Good night, Josephine.
<s> Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
<s> You think he's too old for me?
<s> Why not?  He keeps marrying girls all the time!
<s> His mother - we need her approval.  But I'm not worried - because I don't smoke.
<s> Oh, I don't expect it to last.  I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
<s> There's our shaving stuff - and there's Sugar.
<s> Get me Room 414.
<s> I may throw up.
<s> Yeah - lets shove off.
<s> That's ridiculous.
<s> I may spill something.
<s> We have some bourbon - lets make Manhattans.
<s> Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.
<s> A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
<s> We'll rent some at the bathhouse. How about you, Josephine?
<s> That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
<s> It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
<s> Or was it Bryn Mawr?
<s> Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
<s> Of course not.  As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  You see he needs help.
<s> This is our manager, Mr. Bienstock. I'm Sweet Sue.
<s> Oh - those.  I don't know.  Mice?
<s> The Florida job?
<s> - and you got to be girls.
<s> Bull fiddle.
<s> Yes, Osgood?
<s> We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.
<s> Yes, Joe.
<s> If they catch me once more, they'll boot me out of the band.  You the replacement for the bass and the sax?
<s> That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!
<s> That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums.
<s> I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
<s> Glasses?
<s> Search me.  I mean - I'll see.
<s> Would you mind terribly?
<s> Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> Not at all.
<s> Could be.  Do you play the market?
<s> For your own amusement?
<s> - Inauguration balls -
<s> Tonight?
<s> Yes.  So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it.
<s> Yes, you're in the way.  He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.
<s> Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
<s> Looks like they're on the wrong track.
<s> Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
<s> It's more like a mental block.  When I'm with girls, it does nothing to me.
<s> Oh, you couldn't possibly.
<s> Have you ever tried American girls?
<s> If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
<s> I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
<s> Oh, you know - Junior League - charity bazaars - I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.
<s> I'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - I think he's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve.
<s> From a rich millionaire.
<s> According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
<s> Booze.
<s> If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
<s> Clark Street?  Never heard of it.
<s> I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.
<s> Why wouldn't I?
<s> So Tony Pee-Pants starts ignoring Kat. He wanted to play with me.
<s> Still--
<s> It was just after we moved here. My little girls got in a fight over Tony Pee-Pants and they haven’t made up since.
<s> I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now she’s getting married.
<s> Shrink, actually.
<s> What?
<s> Hello, Katmandu.
<s> Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
<s> Not for a dog.
<s> When we were together I was “too here,” now I’m not here enough.
<s> You have feet?
<s> Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
<s> You stand on your tiptoes.
<s> This happened to you?
<s> First of all, it’s never out of the blue. And second of all--
<s> What?!
<s> I’ve got this bad taste in my mouth. What is it? I think it’s the words: “morally repugnant.”
<s> Not dollars. Pounds.
<s> I didn’t say he was worth it.
<s> Thank you.
<s> You have more than one gynecologist?
<s> Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.
<s> Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
<s> Just drunk enough.
<s> I try...
<s> And you're a tired little boy. I'll make up the cot and you must get some sleep.
<s> Not now, David, it's time for bed. You have a long trip ahead of you in the morning...
<s> What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
<s> :His visit with his father at the County Jail house --
<s> I did look, Charlie, but I--
<s> They is!? It shore is good to see you, boy!
<s> What happened afta that?
<s> Mornin', Daddy...
<s> And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
<s> Yes, David...
<s> David!
<s> No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
<s> Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
<s> Miss Johnson is a teacher, and...
<s> He won't go mad -- he's just lookin' for a cooler spot.
<s> I'll walk...
<s> What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
<s> Don't belong to you! It's for the little important man, here!
<s> Why don't you pay him a visit, Mr. Howard? He'll tell you all about it.
<s> The boy is hungry, Rebecca.
<s> I'll wait till after the children.
<s> To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
<s> Behold my glory.
<s> About what?
<s> -No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening?
<s> Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!
<s> Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
<s> Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-
<s> WAGAGAHGHGH!! YOU GUYS!!! SERIOUSLY!!!
<s> No you can't Kenny!
<s> Okay.    Not.
<s> Yes, hon?
<s> God Damn it your mom is a bitch, Kyle.
<s> Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone licks your ass for-
<s> I don't know.
<s> Something big, children.
<s> It's... It's not good children.
<s> What?
<s> Get everyone in hell ready. When the blood of Terrance and Phillip spills, the day is ours!
<s> FREEZE!!
<s> She's not my girlfriend, dude!
<s> Me?!
<s> Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
<s> Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for us. You're a real pal.
<s> Wake up, people!  We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
<s> -Or monkey fucker-
<s> Right away, ma'am!
<s> What the hell is going on?!
<s> No, it was worse than that...
<s> This is NOT a place for fun and games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to go to!
<s> Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
<s> A letter from who, you shit sucking cock master?
<s> You bet, Terrance!
<s> This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
<s> I know, Terrance. I know.
<s> Terrance! NO!
<s> Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
<s> I know.
<s> You don't care.
<s> I DO respect your mind! It turns me on! It makes me wanna fuck the shit out of you! Don't you see?
<s> Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!
<s> Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not hear okay?
<s> This is about freedom of speech, Stan, about censorship.
<s> You don't get it Stan... You just don't get it.
<s> Stan?! YOU started La Resistance?
<s> And the butfor?
<s> Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about.
<s> Well get used to it, 'cause here we are, on the cruise of a lifetime.
<s> You're Warren Wayne.
<s> It certainly is.
<s> I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly.
<s> You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
<s> I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
<s> Well, I guess she figures she's paying for it.
<s> Uh...
<s> You better start making sense!
<s> I don't know.  I really haven't made up my mind yet.  We'll see how nicely they behave.
<s> Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
<s> That's clear.
<s> Like that piece of ass he was with.
<s> Will you shut up already?
<s> That's right.
<s> It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
<s> Great.
<s> Why can't we?
<s> Words to live by.
<s> The room is filled with poison gas.  The hydraulic system must have blown.
<s> Barnes?
<s> How does the distress signal look?
<s> Over and out.
<s> Good.  In that case, I pronounce us man and wife.
<s> Are you nuts!  It's too risky!
<s> Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
<s> Baby, take it easy.
<s> Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
<s> The engines!
<s> Mac.  What's shaking?
<s> Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
<s> Certainly.  Anything I can do to be of service.
<s> Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
<s> I should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one.
<s> You afraid we're gonna steal it?
<s> How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!
<s> Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
<s> brainstorm, Buzz. I admit, I thought it was a rotten idea, but I put up the scratch.  And now we got a beautiful thing.
<s> Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
<s> Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
<s> I'm your blood.
<s> I don't need the stinking pro-tour.
<s> I gotta survive.
<s> I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
<s> Cool!
<s> I'll tell you one thing, you won't see me around that alley with that freak on the loose. Stay away from his ass - and don't play any of his fuckin' knock-knock jokes.
<s> It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
<s> Buzz Fazeli.
<s> Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
<s> You made me hurt him!
<s> It's not an "Alley". I hate when people call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so common! I prefer "Bowling Center".
<s> I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
<s> He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.
<s> Look who's talking!
<s> Who wants to know?  Zeus!
<s> They suspended me.
<s> I'm not here to - I can't...
<s> No, not at all.
<s> Not while I'm in training.
<s> I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
<s> It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
<s> More than you could afford.
<s> I could let them go for ten.
<s> You're here.
<s> Too late for what, Sheila?
<s> We would have sooner or later.
<s> If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
<s> I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.
<s> At least I'll die smiling.
<s> Plan C. From now on it's gonna be plan C. Both bodies throb and grind, their sandy hands sliding over each others' sweaty skin.
<s> I've been trapped by Miles Kastle my whole life. She walks over to her scooter, and mounts it.
<s> Suck my dick!
<s> You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.
<s> So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
<s> It's burning...
<s> Basic English?  There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet.
<s> Yeah.  I heard you.
<s> Why can't I -- ?  What the hell is going on here?
<s> He's right beneath us.
<s> Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
<s> Geologists?
<s> -- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
<s> I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
<s> What do you mean, he's missing?
<s> How drastic?
<s> She should've known better.
<s> That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.
<s> Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...
<s> ... it raises a very serious question: <u>What happens if Jerry</u> <u>gets mad</u>?
<s> If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
<s> You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
<s> Nothing.  I don't know.  Everything was normal.  No changes at all.
<s> Harry?  Can you copy?
<s> Well, where the fuck is he?
<s> If the subs aren't here yet, sir --
<s> I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm just stating the facts.  The outer metal is made of a titanium alloy, built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb.  The necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented.
<s> The what?
<s> Radiation shield, you think?
<s> Considered what?  That it's American? How would you think it's American?
<s> Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know?  See this red here.
<s> Ted, shut up.  Are you packed?  Ready to go?  I want everyone packed.  Now!
<s> Too big?
<s> The library.
<s> They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
<s> She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
<s> What are they?
<s> So what?
<s> What?
<s> Beth --
<s> What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
<s> Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
<s> Fixing it.
<s> You think?
<s> This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
<s> I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
<s> How can the sphere do that?
<s> Which I told Barnes was attacking --
<s> Sintag.
<s> For what?
<s> Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
<s> You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  "Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.
<s> Is it?
<s> When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?
<s> It's not safe for you to be either.
<s> Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.
<s> I know.  You're too strong, Beth.
<s> Let's get out of here, Beth.  Let's go home.
<s> You'd have to ask them.
<s> That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
<s> Just in time for what?
<s> Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
<s> Fine.  I'm fine.
<s> I'm fine.
<s> Look, would you --
<s> Whatever I can do to help.
<s> Am I?
<s> What noise?
<s> What are you still doing here?
<s> What is it, Harry?
<s> That far in what, Harry?
<s> How do we decode it?
<s> The three of us.
<s> You know what it is, Harry.
<s> You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
<s> Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
<s> It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
<s> It's not a discharge.  Right, Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So it's gotta be a message.
<s> Like what?
<s> Unless it's an act.
<s> What?
<s> I'm Ben Kenobi.  Luke Starkiller here is leading our expedition.
<s> I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
<s> All right then, we'll use your plan.
<s> We'll be back before you are, old man.
<s> I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
<s> But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
<s> My father used to talk about the Force of Others.  But he never told me what it was...
<s> What do you mean?
<s> I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
<s> You look great!  The uniform and everything!
<s> But there was a lot of firing earlier...
<s> What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
<s> You don't believe in the Force?
<s> What are you saying?
<s> Get Chewbacca.  Try to get around it. I'll draw it away.
<s> There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here.
<s> But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!
<s> Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
<s> I'd consider it an honor.
<s> It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!
<s> Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
<s> Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
<s> In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts.
<s> Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
<s> Didn't they tell you, Colonel ? That's what cap troopres are good for.
<s> Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
<s> I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate.
<s> THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
<s> Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude.
<s> No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
<s> Excuse me...!
<s> I'll meet you outside.
<s> What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
<s> Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.
<s> We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
<s> We've gotta go get her !
<s> Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
<s> Sure.
<s> Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.
<s> That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen !
<s> A year at Harvard and you'll  see this "Federal Service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives.
<s> Looks like rain.
<s> I'm not going on vacation ! I want to be acitizen ! It's my decision. I made it.
<s> It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.
<s> Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...?
<s> Keep trying, Sergeant.
<s> Good luck. It's not there anymore.
<s> Sir, yes, sir !
<s> Uh, no.
<s> Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
<s> I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.
<s> Move out.
<s> This is my farm. Now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here...
<s> Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
<s> Yes, sir...
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> I can't My legs are gone... Get on the boat...
<s> Give'em hell, sir !
<s> V'ger is that which programmed me.
<s> You may proceede.
<s> When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
<s> To learn all that is learnable; to deliver all collected data to the Creator on the third planet. That is the programming.
<s> V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
<s> Spock...!  Get a fix on his position!
<s> Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
<s> Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
<s> Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
<s> Sit down, please.
<s> Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
<s> Mr. Decker... ?
<s> Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?
<s> A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.
<s> That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
<s> I prefer your poet Dante's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.'
<s> Evening, Cal.  Would you tell me about it?
<s> Sure plan to.
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> Don't be so hard on yourself.
<s> As the Old Mill goes around...
<s> And likewise.
<s> That's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...
<s> Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...
<s> It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  "You <u>can</u> go back..."
<s> You bet your life.  "The mill wheel goes around...some times it's even under water -- then it rises up, as high as it can go..."
<s> Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
<s> What?
<s> Better idea...
<s> Then I'll come back, then.
<s> So is our electoral process.  But we still vote.
<s> Time for a change.  Keep your margins straight.
<s> They meet on Main Street.  Her horse has just died.  He's coming from the fire.
<s> Is it...
<s> Oh yeah.
<s> Now you're talking...
<s> Not without a rolltop desk.
<s> Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
<s> Carla was in the car, right?
<s> ...I'm sure that people are upset...
<s> We'll work it out...
<s> What?
<s> Hi.
<s> Uh -- why did we have to leave New Hampshire?
<s> Fifteen hands.
<s> You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
<s> Nothing happened.
<s> No, I was, I was, I was just <u>learning</u> on, it's a...
<s> 
<s> She's a...
<s> What...
<s> Bob, Bob, stick to the business, will you?
<s> Well, yeah, I'm fine, I reached over to, the girl had to be home, I don't know, it's a <u>schoolnight</u>, something...
<s> I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
<s> You have to what?
<s> Mr. Bailey.
<s> Well, what's the beef?
<s> I wasn't in the car.
<s> He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
<s> I, actually yes.
<s> I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
<s> I...
<s> She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait!  She came in here...she...  ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, I told her I could not--we don't know each other, you see...
<s> I told her Thank You Very Much, but it was inconvenient because...uh... because...
<s> Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...
<s> Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
<s> ...and, and, and did she...?  And she did the seven shows...
<s> I'm only trying to...
<s> ...she has a <u>home</u>...
<s> Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
<s> Marty...
<s> Bob Barrenger...Bob...Bob Barrenger's in this movie?
<s> Who got their heads cut?
<s> You said <u>three</u>...?
<s> You've got nothing, you don't have a witness...
<s> Wait a sec, Marty.  Call us back.  Two minutes.
<s> I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
<s> I don't know what she's bitching about, she's flashed her tits in the last five movies...she'd bare her breasts to do a <u>voice</u> over.
<s> Did you, where are we going tonight...?
<s> You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...
<s> I grew up on your mov...
<s> I know you do.
<s> Where have you been...?
<s> I'm gonna nail it.
<s> The girl was in the car.
<s> I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
<s> I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
<s> I'm...Tuesday evening we're having an informal dinner, I didn't know you'd be 'on set,' but if you'd like to join your...
<s> My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself.
<s> No no no no no no no no no find me the money...
<s> Actually, the art department had some ideas on...
<s> And we're glad to have you here...
<s> Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
<s> That's very kind of...as a matter-of- fact, one, I hate to <u>bother</u> you with...
<s> ...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
<s> ...it is?
<s> Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
<s> I killed her!
<s> Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face.  You wind up looking like...
<s> Well, he's not president anymore, so why be petty.
<s> Why does Rachel scream?
<s> During sex.
<s> No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...
<s> Are you <u>kidding</u>?  It is <u>so</u> much better than the one Rachel showed me!
<s> She is but an arriviste.
<s> A debate.  Man's inhumanity to woman.  He's pro women.  I'm con. Ms. Flannery is twisted.
<s> And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
<s> <u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
<s> I <u>killed</u> my math quiz, A-minus.
<s> You think this is funny?
<s> ...laughed, yeh.  They laughed real hard.
<s> There you are!
<s> Then have a donut --
<s> Alright starve.
<s> Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
<s> No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
<s> Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
<s> Tomorrow?  Can I have one butterscotch pudding for dessert?
<s> How do you know?
<s> They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.
<s> You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
<s> We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke?
<s> Don't do this.
<s> Partly.  But partly, you're mad.
<s> Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
<s> To make it easier for them or you?
<s> This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
<s> Think twice.  Before you <u>ever</u> pull that again.
<s> You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
<s> I did it for her.
<s> Anxiety.
<s> Not great.  Plus, I've got things on my mind.  You know.
<s> I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets.  And the note.  From your new boss.
<s> We can't live like that.
<s> Luke.  Can't live like that.
<s> Luke's depo ran late.  I promised I'd take notes.
<s> You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
<s> Thanks, but it's under control.
<s> Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
<s> I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
<s> Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
<s> Aw.
<s> You weren't passing 'em out.
<s> Neutral ground.  What's up?
<s> Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
<s> Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here.
<s> He only remembers I <u>found</u> him.  My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you.
<s> Uh.  You hate my guts?
<s> Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
<s> We have to talk.
<s> I didn't want to spoil our supper...
<s> Yeh, it's cheaper.
<s> I trust you of course I do but --
<s> What do you call it?  You told her you had doubts.
<s> No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
<s> Does Jackie know this?
<s> Great to be here.
<s> I'm always working.
<s> Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
<s> Got a lot of homework?
<s> You started filling out your college applications yet?
<s> You know, you have to. Sometimes you just have to, Toby.
<s> I dunno.
<s> Huh?
<s> You mean, again?
<s> You know he hated my story also.
<s> I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
<s> ...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism?
<s> Dad, I'm trying to figure things out right now, OK? It's like, really hard, and I'm just listening to some old Elton John and...
<s> Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
<s> Hi, Dad!
<s> Sure, Dad.
<s> Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
<s> No.
<s> Say, 'Nigger.'
<s> 'Fuck me hard!'
<s> Again!!
<s> Oh, fine. How are you?
<s> I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
<s> Yeah.
<s> But what did you get on your SATs?
<s> Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
<s> Sure…um…yeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
<s> I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
<s> What happened!
<s> You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles.
<s> After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
<s> No but you didn't defend him either! Didn't want to rock the boat.  Guess the ride was too smooth. FILMORE I was acting under legal counsel!
<s> I don't see why they wouldn't be.
<s> Yes, you should.
<s> We have a special forces squadron out of Thailand surrounding the compound as we speak.
<s> He's in there...
<s> Chemco is willing to deal with him, meet his demands.  I can have the money there in an hour.
<s> I'm sure you'll figure it out.
<s> I'll let the senator tell you.
<s> The ball is in Richter's court.  But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!
<s> Richter-we got a problem!
<s> Did you get that, Kulnick?
<s> Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.
<s> It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
<s> I know nothing of the sort!
<s> Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
<s> The three-letter code group.  Or maybe some combination of the three letters. P...O...E, or P...E...O, or E...O...P... let's see, there would be six possible combinations.
<s> Look, I didn't shoot him!
<s> Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
<s> Look, Colonel.  You keep me covered, but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to Air Command headquarters. Okay?...I won't play any tricks on you... Okay?
<s> That's government property, Major.
<s> I know it sounds crazy, sir, but we tried, and nobody answers any of the telephones.
<s> This is General Ripper speaking.
<s> But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?
<s> Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?
<s> No, sir.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> That's right, Major.
<s> He said war was too important a matter to be left to Generals.
<s> If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
<s> Not yet, Major.  Not yet.
<s> But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
<s> Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
<s> If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
<s> No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
<s> Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.  I think I can.
<s> Why can't you cancel it?
<s> That's the idea, General Schmuck.  Zlat!
<s> Knock it off will you, General?  Crudley, find out what's holding up that call!
<s> General Faceman, what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson?
<s> Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
<s> Well, just common sense, sir.  Thirty from thirty-four equals four, or my name's not "Buck" Schmuck!
<s> The dirty, stinking, rotten, sons of B's!! They might have clobbered Marge and the
<s> War?
<s> Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state.
<s> Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary.
<s> Speed?
<s> Must be Mach two-five stuff.  Altitude fifteen thousand.
<s> Sure, I'll take her up right now.
<s> Primary arming switch.
<s> Some kind of signaling.
<s> Master Kong.
<s> Sorry, King.
<s> Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
<s> But I get a red light.
<s> Let me check.
<s> Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
<s> What the hell are you doing here, Lothar?
<s> Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.
<s> Yeah.
<s> No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
<s> I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
<s> No, thanks. I don't drink. Um, well, what'd she say? I mean, did she talk to him?
<s> Oh. Well, what's it on?
<s> Oh.
<s> Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
<s> No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
<s> And your mom.
<s> Where are you-hoo?
<s> Yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea.
<s> Sorry.
<s> Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.
<s> So, we're all old friends of Pony's. We go way back to our childhood.
<s> Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
<s> What, they're looking for her?
<s> No. It didn't, Buff.
<s> We're your customers. We're not complaining.
<s> That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.
<s> Don't drop the guitar, man.
<s> Hey, thanks, man.
<s> Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
<s> Mm.
<s> Military marching bands.
<s> You cut off your little finger?
<s> Taking care of business.
<s> Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
<s> Two-fifty? They go up?
<s> Sooze wants to see him.
<s> Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
<s> What?
<s> Yeah, fuck 'em.
<s> That chick, Erica?
<s> Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
<s> They're just people. Alright? They got feelings, you know?
<s> Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
<s> So you can give me more shit?
<s> I'm trying to communicate how I feel, Jeff. You know raise consciousness. Make people think for a change.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
<s> Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
<s> So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?
<s> No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
<s> Wait. What, what are you saying?
<s> Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
<s> Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
<s> Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
<s> What?
<s> Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
<s> Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
<s> Burnfield. No place like it.
<s> Well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?
<s> Camel jockey.
<s> Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
<s> It's stupid.
<s> Mm-hm.
<s> Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
<s> Really? What else does your mother say?
<s> Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
<s> Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Come on, Jeff.
<s> No car.
<s> Look, it's really not my fault.
<s> Cleo!
<s> No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.
<s> You sure?
<s> Hee-hee-hee, haaaaa-that's it?  Hee-hee hee...
<s> She thinks you went to the police.
<s> Trix...
<s> Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
<s> We were told you could "fix us up."
<s> Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
<s> Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
<s> Before you?  Whoo-hoo!
<s> Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?
<s> Where's the bar?
<s> I'll take it.
<s> Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.
<s> I just think pictures should say a little something.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Why, you sweet kid.
<s> We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
<s> O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
<s> You'll be waiting for me?
<s> Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
<s> I tell you this is half sold.
<s> See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.
<s> I'll make it short.
<s> I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
<s> You're tough, all right.
<s> Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in.
<s> And here's a title: AN APPLE FOR THE TEACHER.
<s> Oh, that.  It's from a friend of mine.  A middle-aged lady, very foolish and very generous.
<s> Nice job.
<s> Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
<s> This is where you live?
<s> That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
<s> If you love me, Joe.
<s> And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
<s> I'm not worried.  Everything will be fine.  The old team together. Nothing can stop us.
<s> It's a good script, isn't it?
<s> It is not.  Get out.
<s> Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
<s> Fair enough.
<s> Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.
<s> Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
<s> Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.
<s> There's something wrong with your car, you said.
<s> I'm used to paying my own bills.
<s> Unpack nothing.  I didn't say I was staying.
<s> Just a scene I cut out.
<s> Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.
<s> Can't you wait till I'm dummy?
<s> I don't need a tuxedo.
<s> Come here!
<s> Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
<s> Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
<s> DeMille is Leo.  I'm Scorpio. Mars has been transmitting Jupiter for weeks.  Today is the day of greatest conjuction. Now turn around.  Let me dry you.
<s> I ran into some people I knew.
<s> I think I'll read a little.
<s> Dressed for what?
<s> Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?
<s> I'm not here.
<s> Good.
<s> It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.
<s> I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements.
<s> She is upstairs.
<s> You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.
<s> Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.
<s> Frankly, no.
<s> If it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
<s> Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
<s> The cameras have arrived, Madame.
<s> Shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
<s> What do you want?
<s> Yes. It reminds me of home.
<s> Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.
<s> Well...I guess one is all right.
<s> You can't just abandon me.  Alone.
<s> I sort of like what you said.
<s> It seemed that way to me.
<s> I don't see why not.
<s> Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
<s> What?
<s> Yes.
<s> Do you want to come to Argo City?
<s> I did.
<s> But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
<s> You vicious--
<s> Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.
<s> The scoop of the year!
<s> But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> You sure?
<s> I'd love to.
<s> A cheap trick.
<s> Not yet.
<s> It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
<s> Of course, my dear. What can I do?
<s> You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
<s> Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. Boring!
<s> Don't stop. Keep moving.
<s> Buddy, are we in trouble.
<s> TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!
<s> Nope.  Never. 
<s> For a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, Kent.
<s> Too much mayonnaise?
<s> I didn't --
<s> You thought that?
<s> But all he had was chocolate milk.
<s> No, thanks.
<s> Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
<s> Me too. That's why I put this one up.
<s> Let me do it for you, Mr. White.
<s> Kent!
<s> Thirty-five.
<s> What about this week's check?
<s> First paycheck?
<s> Say who?
<s> Or socks.
<s> Decaffeinated too?
<s> A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail."  And you are going to do it for me.
<s> First question got to be "Where."
<s> Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.
<s> KRYPTONITE!
<s> Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking "get-down hot-cha daddy-o" whatever you called it.
<s> Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.
<s> Just a second.
<s> I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
<s> Will you stop interrupting ?!  You will command the pumps to stop pumping.
<s> That's his sister. Vera Webster.
<s> A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures.  The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!
<s> You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
<s> I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
<s> We've already met.
<s> Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
<s> Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
<s> How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
<s> Where did it come from?
<s> Yeah. I'll check.
<s> So far the hostages are unharmed.
<s> Well, you never will again!  Thanks to Vitamin C! I'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of Vitamin C every day.
<s> That's because you can hardly see through those things.
<s> No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
<s> Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
<s> We'd better talk.
<s> Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
<s> I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
<s> But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
<s> Lois, I really don't see why --
<s> Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
<s> Uh...home...
<s> There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
<s> Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
<s> I wouldn't know. I've never had one.
<s> That was two days ago. Frankly, I think this place is a bit boring. It's all white. Why doesn't the guy put up some posters? Maybe some bullfight things . . .
<s> Give it another ten minutes. If we don't --  Hell, I'll tell him.  Pete? If we haven't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt. banner and run the picture for three columns.  Kent,	I need a background story for the page 3 sidebar. Give me every thing you know about this terrorist group.
<s> He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.  You do, don't you, Kent?
<s> Yes, but it's not all I feel.
<s> Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
<s> Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it.
<s> Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
<s> I really don't think . . .
<s> Don't worry. I won't make you do it alone. I know all the right places. I'm a member at all the right clubs . . . We'll start tonight at the grand opening of the Metro Club! It's a date!
<s> Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
<s> Come early. The view is so romantic from my balcony.
<s> Oh . . . Right. . . I'll be back in a flash.
<s> That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
<s> Gee guys, that's swell of you. But  . . . I've got another idea.
<s> Superman gets mail here?
<s> Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
<s> There!
<s> Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down.
<s> I made you, and I can destroy you.
<s> What do you fear?
<s> Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
<s> Stop saying you know when I say 'y'know.' I know you know.  Yes, I know you're here, Otis. What do you want, a brass band?
<s> Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
<s> Actually, she's silver-haired.
<s> Unbelievable.
<s> You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
<s> No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.
<s> Not unless you can fly.
<s> They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.
<s> See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?
<s> I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with --
<s> I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
<s> Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
<s> an Ode to Spring. are there one or two "T's" in bloodletting?
<s> Gets you where you live, huh?
<s> What's your name, boy?
<s> Guess I'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that...that thing he was settin' in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening?
<s> But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
<s> Okay, but...why?  No offense.
<s> You think they're strange?
<s> Thirty-five.
<s> What about it?
<s> Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
<s> Excellent, Otis.  But what took you so long?
<s> Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
<s> We'll see how fast I can fly.
<s> How are you?
<s> I'd heard that.  But she's well?
<s> Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally.
<s> I'll tell her that.
<s> Why?
<s> Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
<s> Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the truth.  It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. I want you to drop the damned thing.
<s> It does concern me.
<s> Why not?
<s> So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.
<s> A while.
<s> When the game's over, I guess.
<s> Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
<s> It's natural.
<s> Yes.
<s> You think that caused the accident, Risa?  That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  Or maybe they're the same thing.
<s> From what?
<s> Berry-picking.
<s> What's that, Dolores?
<s> Yes.  He does.
<s> Mrs.  Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does not volunteer to say so in court, I will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect.
<s> Yes.
<s> There might have been a word or two that slipped by.  Maybe you could clarify it for me, just to be absolutely sure.
<s> A cup of tea would be nice.  Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto?  I want to talk to you.
<s> Would you like a cup of tea, Billy? There's a piece of cake left.
<s> The people in the town?
<s> You hate that.
<s> Unless the report from the National Weather Bureau for the district on January 23 goes into the record, I will object to that question.
<s> And what was the weather like at this time?
<s> Will you be spending more than a night?
<s> ...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and...
<s> Crafts?
<s> So what's the problem?
<s> 'Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm?  Is that what you're thinking, Daddy?
<s> Is there shrimp on it?
<s> Who did they get for that?
<s> You remember that much?
<s> There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods.  And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual.  I remember that.  I'm remembering it pretty clearly.
<s> No.
<s> Really?
<s> You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
<s> The ramp?
<s> No.
<s> It's too late for that.  She can't drive the bus anymore.  The school board saw to that right off.
<s> The Ottos.
<s> The next time you want information, Falco, don't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man!
<s> Your nephew doesn't want a drink.
<s> Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
<s> Give me a chance --
<s> You've been very kind about it, Mr. Hunsecker. HUNSECKER Give Susie credit for that.  I took her word that there was nothing to the smear.  Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today.  That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too.
<s> Who said Sidney?
<s> I haven't said anything yet, J.J., but if -
<s> A man couldn't ask for a squarer shake.  Let me have Billy Van Cleve...  Don't ever tell anyone, Susie, how I'm tied to your apron strings...  Billy!  J.J.!  What's this about that boy?  What boy?  Where are we, lug, in a drawing room comedy? You're brain is warming up, sweetheart - yeah, Dallas!...  No, don't explain your point of view, but...
<s> Now don't kid a kidder.
<s> She mighta jumped.  Love suicide?  Check it for me, Phil...it's a real heart throb.
<s> I don't believe it.
<s> You just had a good example of it. A press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna.
<s> I didn't say that, J.J.
<s> You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.
<s> I'll listen one more minute.
<s> Get Steve back his job...please...
<s> How does it matter who's sister? The main thing, they're through and -
<s> The man in jail is always for freedom.
<s> J.J., I swear to you on my mother's life, I won't do it.  If you gave me your COLUMN I wouldn't do a thing like that...
<s> Yeah...  And another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'...  You know J.J....!
<s> At the bar - Sidney...
<s> In his apartment -
<s> Hello.
<s> I beg your pardon!  I turn myself inside out to help you and now I'm a heavy.  Here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door!
<s> What sort of thing?
<s> It isn't.  I've just seen the early edition.
<s> Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't do a dance with me...
<s> That's no way to talk...
<s> Well, I'll tell you what - excuse me for breathing, will ya?  How do you like it?  He comes to my office and -
<s> Why don't we hear what Susie has to say?
<s> Yes, but why?
<s> Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.
<s> I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
<s> But I don't care about that now. He knew what he was doing today. He was laying down the conditions under which he MIGHT consent to our marriage - if I would bend to every whim of his, like Sidney!  I couldn't do that, Susie...
<s> But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!...
<s> I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my ass.  I thought we had it with this one...
<s> Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
<s> Why did you marry me, Miles?  Why did we have these two children?  You don't need us.  Your heart and your mind are in here.  But it doesn't love you like we do.
<s> Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
<s> Now listen to me very carefully.
<s> You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
<s> It can't form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes.
<s> Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
<s> Why?
<s> No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo.
<s> Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.
<s> Yes.  Throw it in.
<s> I order you not to!
<s> I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?
<s> I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
<s> Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
<s> You see, Sarah... here's the problem.  I know how smart you are, and I think you're just telling me what I want to hear.  I don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today.
<s> So do you.
<s> Why him?
<s> Relax now, Sarah --
<s> Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
<s> and totally irrelevant.
<s> But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?
<s> Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
<s> Three months.
<s> Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
<s> No. Ours was damaged.
<s> That is correct.
<s> I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.
<s> I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
<s> Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
<s> I wasn't told. I just knew it.
<s> Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
<s> You know something? You should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than Double Indemnity. What do you imagine people thought? The Berlin Philharmonic's taken over by Doctor Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is a freelance, so art and politics are now entirely separate? Is that what you believed ordinary people thought?
<s> No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
<s> But you see what I'm getting at? You get a gorgeous house, you're highly paid. What are you gonna do, stay or leave? One voice comes back at me: stay!
<s> Those attitudes do not exist in me.
<s> Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
<s> Of course I know what that is.
<s> That's what I asked.
<s> Not here, Major, there are people, if anybody should see... please, please, Major...
<s> Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country.
<s> One of my people?
<s> His private life?
<s> Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
<s> Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
<s> Alright!
<s> All.
<s> That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
<s> We will, kiddo.
<s> That's none of your business.
<s> One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff.
<s> I volunteered.
<s> You like it?  It's my first.
<s> That's the way it was told to me.
<s> Fuck you!  Let go of me!
<s> Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.
<s> It's better that way.
<s> You'll beg for mercy in a second.
<s> I can't sleep.
<s> You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
<s> Then, you kiss his ass.
<s> A game?
<s> You should be.
<s> If there was one.
<s> It's not like anyone could actually open it.
<s> Investment banking.  Moving money from place to place.
<s> Don't.  It was a shitty job anyway. I overreacted.
<s> I thought...
<s> No cops.  I've got a warrant out. Mail fraud.  They'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else.
<s> How?  How could they have gotten anything?
<s> What are you talking about... ?
<s> ... what... ?
<s> We searched the house.
<s> No...
<s> I have to show you...
<s> That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.
<s> What about dinner sometime, when you get back?  Would that be... ?
<s> So do you.  And to think I was worried...
<s> I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
<s> Fun?
<s> This isn't an escort service?
<s> Like a stroke?
<s> Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait...
<s> We're going to figure this out.  Get a grip on yourself.
<s> Really?
<s> Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
<s> Yeah, yeah.  She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane.
<s> Robbed?
<s> You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
<s> I'll call.  I really will.
<s> No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
<s> Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
<s> An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
<s> Don't worry.  It's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
<s> First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.
<s> I'm just like him.
<s> Because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it.
<s> Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
<s> Why are you following me?
<s> Nothing.  Nothing at all.
<s> You know you can.
<s> What about the house?
<s> It's not Victorian, everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was Victorian.  This is gothic, this is English Craftsman, this is Romanesque.  This is... insane.  Who lives here?
<s> Come on.  These are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist.
<s> Greetings.
<s> No.
<s> And that will be a good place to end this study.
<s> Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
<s> I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
<s> Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you.
<s> Who?
<s> Don't tell me Boston is different from New York.
<s> Yes.  I've missed it.
<s> I think so.
<s> I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
<s> Well, you're certainly not a person.
<s> Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
<s> We think?
<s> Why not?
<s> Where do we go?
<s> Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
<s> And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
<s> We'll find him.
<s> Lookin' good.
<s> What'd you call that -- the Protector?
<s> Terry Valentine.
<s> I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine.
<s> Y'what?
<s> This ain't your lot?
<s> Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
<s> What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
<s> I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
<s> Not much -- you?
<s> Really.
<s> I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
<s> Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail.  I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
<s> Now who's being sarcastic?
<s> Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
<s> Based in London, but with international concerns.
<s> What do you think.
<s> She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.
<s> A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.
<s> Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
<s> A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
<s> I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
<s> What's in Big Sur?
<s> Yeah.  Cheers, mate.
<s> I got half.
<s> Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
<s> I doubt it.
<s> Since when?
<s> The government knows. I cannot repeat it to you. But this thing goes deep, Ed. This was not your wife. I goes deep, and involves the government. There is a great deal of fear. You know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. They try to limit it, and--
<s> Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. After this happened, things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again.
<s> I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
<s> Oh, Mr Crane--
<s> Uh--
<s> Jesus! The barber! I'll be a sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 'Course--the barber.
<s> Yeah.
<s> All right, I guess.
<s> I only work here! And the lady's husband would know... Oh, Jesus.
<s> The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
<s> He's staying at the hotel I've gone to with, uh, with the lady in question. Must've seen us.
<s> I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
<s> I, uh...
<s> Just coffee.
<s> My wife and I had not... performed the sex act in many years.
<s> Nah, don't say anything. I'm alright.
<s> ...OK.
<s> I tried to tell him the whole story, but Riedenschneider stopped me. He said the story made his head hurt, and anyway he didn't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of Big Dave...
<s> Oh, hell. Drink?
<s> Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
<s> Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
<s> I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
<s> Sure, Walter. Thanks.
<s> Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
<s> I know who you are, Mr Crane.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Whuddya mean?
<s> Hello, Walter.
<s> Yeah--
<s> They sent us to tell ya.
<s> Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
<s> You haven't got the authority.  Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
<s> I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest of you can go with Cuthbert!
<s> Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
<s> Correct.
<s> The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
<s> There's a dead body in the exhibit! People are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.
<s> Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
<s> Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.
<s> You're right.
<s> Quadrupedal!  The other name for Mbwun.  "He Who Walks on All Fours."
<s> No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.
<s> Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough these days.  According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.
<s> They fill seven floors.  We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world.  Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens.  Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems.  Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display.
<s> Not really.  Just the sub-basement.
<s> I don't know.  It was walled over.  No one's been down there in years.
<s> I don't believe it.
<s> He's right.
<s> Footsteps!
<s> I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
<s> Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
<s> Like this.
<s> Not on the map.  Looks like it connects with the city sewer.
<s> Quiet.
<s> Another storage room.
<s> But at what a price.
<s> Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
<s> What kind of hormones?
<s> So what?
<s> Okay.
<s> An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
<s> You have time to talk?
<s> You were going to be married.
<s> What happened?
<s> You were behind me?  Running after me?
<s> All right.  If you're positive.
<s> No.  I think I'm hallucinating.
<s> No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  I think it was bothered by my light.
<s> It's scared of me.
<s> Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
<s> I think... it means it's full.
<s> How?
<s> It's deceptively simple.  Like a Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse.
<s> You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
<s> I have to shoot.
<s> <i>A month.</i>
<s> No, hold back...
<s> He was tidying up his garbage.  I was going to call you.  But half-way through, he gave up and fell asleep.
<s> Certainly a nomination.
<s> As with our own lives, the only people he can't cast are his family.  Otherwise he has final approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend, Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player.
<s> No, of course not.  And since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement.
<s> It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
<s> Sorry, I'm way behind.
<s> <i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
<s> Truman?  It's me, Marlon.  I need to talk to you.
<s> Gee, that's great.
<s> --I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
<s> I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?
<s> You blaming me for the traffic?
<s> I'm sure they're just exaggerating.
<s> --Truman, you're gonna be late!
<s> Well, I made it through another night.
<s> I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?
<s> Hold on a minute, dear.  Here's us at Mount Rushmore.  You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive.  You slept all the way there.
<s> Fine.  I'll tell her.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.
<s> You can count on it.
<s> Sorry. Don't have one.
<s> They seemed to buy our story about the Hanta virus. You'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community.  Maybe a small roadside memorial.
<s> Into what?
<s> You got some kind of business with him?
<s> What's that?
<s> No. Don't bother.
<s> Show you right on a map.
<s> Before the bomb went off?
<s> And one little boy.
<s> How?
<s> You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
<s> When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
<s> What happened to playing a hunch?
<s> I'm in the vending room.
<s> I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
<s> We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
<s> Evidence of a massive infection.
<s> The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.
<s> That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.
<s> About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
<s> -- of what exactly?!
<s> I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
<s> For the purpose of what?
<s> I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
<s> About what?
<s> She was with me.
<s> But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
<s> How deep does this go?
<s> Yes.
<s> No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
<s> I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
<s> How?
<s> What about you?
<s> She thinks I can bring Edward back.
<s> And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
<s> No.
<s> Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
<s> I can't leave him!
<s> Absolutely.  Abigail...
<s> Yep.  Eloped.
<s> It doesn't matter...
<s> 's broken.
<s> Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry.
<s> That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
<s> Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
<s> It's his dog.
<s> They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia at seven-thirty last night.  You know what time it is now...?!
<s> What else do we do?!
<s> Next time, tell me, okay?
<s> I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
<s> I don't know. How can you know a thing like that afterwards. I don't know anything any more.
<s> He was Harry's driver?
<s> I know. I wondered about it a hundred times, if it really was an accident.
<s> Need we go through it all again?
<s> In German?
<s> Comedy. I don't play tragedy.
<s> What's that?
<s> Tell you what?
<s> It's just what he used to say.
<s> If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
<s> Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
<s> He's safe in the Russian zone.
<s> You won't learn anything from them. They are only love letters. There are not many of them.
<s> No.
<s> It's true then?
<s> What did you say? I'm sorry...
<s> Once in a while.
<s> No.
<s> A bruised lip.
<s> I would like a word with this orderly Harbin.
<s> Bring him in.
<s> Thank you. Excuse me.
<s> Oh, there you are. Come in here, there isn't much time.
<s> All right, Calloway. You win.
<s> Two thirty.
<s> I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
<s> I'm so glad to have met you, sir. I've read quite a few of your books.
<s> No, I don't know...
<s> Certainly.
<s> Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
<s> Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
<s> Coffee.
<s> Tension? KURTZ Suspense.
<s> But he said he died instantaneously.
<s> What's the name of this girl?
<s> The Roumanian?
<s> All right - I'm mad. I've seen a ghost...
<s> Vinkel.
<s> und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
<s> Why didn't they bring him in the house?
<s> Yes.
<s> Funny?
<s> Of course there was. Some ice for Mr. Martins.
<s> Why no, Mr. Martins.
<s> Never.
<s> I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
<s> She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
<s> We moved rooms because of him.
<s> Of course, but look; all these people. If that place existed, they'd all be there.
<s> Why?
<s> Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
<s> So how many miles do you think it is?
<s> Fuck off.
<s> You can swim?
<s> Not too bad.
<s> We swim.
<s> Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
<s> If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we don’t try then we'll never know.
<s> Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
<s> I don't, but...
<s> Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --
<s> That's stupid. Why would they?
<s> That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.
<s> What do you care?
<s> What assholes.
<s> They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay...  How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...
<s> Vuv...Zayin...Chet...Tet...
<s> V'asitem...
<s> No difference.
<s> Judaism doesn't even need God. You have the Torah, the law. That's your fucking God....  The book's closed.
<s> I told you, I'm good at this.
<s> Okay...  Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.
<s> It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
<s> We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already.
<s> I've been waiting all my life for something like this.
<s> No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
<s> I agree.
<s> German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
<s> Do you know who you're fucking with here?
<s> Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
<s> If I tell you, will you pull the story? Not write about me?
<s> The arguments, anyway.
<s> The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
<s> There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seven-thirty.
<s> You do it on the inside....
<s> Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
<s> Fine.
<s> I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like --
<s> Steve...
<s> Number ten.
<s> I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm serious. I'm always talking about it. This time it's gotta happen.
<s> So what do we do with the device?
<s> Where?
<s> Yeah, hey, how're you doing...
<s> I can tell....
<s> Funny?
<s> He was funny.
<s> And that's when the Mets started to stink.
<s> Valentine...
<s> Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
<s> I tried him, he can't go.  His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss.
<s> Italian is practically the same thing.
<s> I think I'll have a coffee.
<s> In a lake.
<s> Have you known him long?
<s> Italy!
<s> No.
<s> ... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
<s> Enzo, stop bitching, will you?
<s> Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
<s> That idiot!
<s> You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
<s> Smoking is absolutely forbidden.
<s> It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
<s> Yes, I know.
<s> Great!
<s> Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
<s> Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
<s> Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule!  I was engaged... for a week.  After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls.
<s> I don't want to erase anything.
<s> We can't dive anymore.  They want to cancel the competition for a while.
<s> Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
<s> No... in the hut.
<s> You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
<s> I did?
<s> Uh... Ah!  A story?
<s> ... Not at all.
<s> ... Nothing.
<s> I saw how it has to be.
<s> Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
<s> No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
<s> He doesn't hear too well.
<s> Again?
<s> Oh Jesus...!  I'll make some coffee.  They left the stove.
<s> Of course, that's what they're for.
<s> Let him sleep.
<s> One last thing Hammer. You take care of yourself. The...
<s> It's Esther.
<s> C'mon follow me.
<s> I said, yeah, about once a week!
<s> No. It's not like that. You're being completely neurotic. I was just playing along...
<s> Mordechai!
<s> You know my friend Maureen? Her son, the investment banker? He paid for her entire retirement in Boca Raton. What a mench he is. Instead of schleping to save Hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an MBA. Maybe then you could send me to Boca, too.
<s> ...I'm not finished yet, mom.
<s> I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
<s> Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
<s> He's still working out some identity issues.
<s> A stereo type alarm system?
<s> I'm just calming the kiddies.  There's no need to worry about Santa. He's just having a peaceful, adult conversation with his nice Jewish friend, The Hebrew Hammer.
<s> Resting?
<s> I can't understand that fancy talk.  You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
<s> Nice fellow?
<s> I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
<s> Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.
<s> You found the leopard!
<s> That's the place: I remember -— My feet were so darn sore, I couldn't make it -- and Galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself --
<s> You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
<s> Who?
<s> Go on -—
<s> You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.
<s> It's to remind people of the great tragedy that took place here so that they won't ever forget that a peaceful village of Indians was wiped out by the Conquistadores, back in the 17th Century... A band of monks buried the dead and prayed for them and did penance for their deaths —— that's what this procession is supposed to be.
<s> I want to ask you something.
<s> Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
<s> I don't know.
<s> If there were a man like that, with a kink in his brain around here loose, what would he be like.
<s> I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
<s> Why do yo&amp;i accuse me? You don't know what you're doing -- you don't understand -- nobody understands --
<s> I am not interested in what somebody else thinks. You being me facts and I'll act on them.
<s> Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
<s> Now look what you've done.
<s> You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show.
<s> And not a sign of the leopard?
<s> You mean you want to take them to the cemetery.
<s> I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
<s> I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
<s> Dial O-O-O on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink, sir.
<s> You... You found that at Leon’s?
<s> Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
<s> You drive a hard bargain.
<s> Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.
<s> You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.
<s> You do want me to keep the job, don’t you, Mrs De Moraes?
<s> Why don’t you ask when I left the Mondrian?
<s> I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
<s> Why do I feel I needn’t answer that?
<s> Something like that.
<s> I didn’t intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that you’d been back.  That we’d argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldn’t help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
<s> He... He is dead!  MY HUSBAND IS DEAD!  Call my parents. They’ll tell you. Call them!
<s> On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
<s> Yes. I’m trying to reach a friend but I can’t get through. The number is 01766 770 471.
<s> No. A poor little rich boy who thought he’d save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second shopping expedition.
<s> Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile I’d sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
<s> I thought you’d never ask... As I was having my coffee and crescents at the Mondrian the other morning I spotted your photograph in the Los Angeles Times... There’s a tough lady, I thought. Just the kind who might help me...
<s> How come you’re alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
<s> What about your friendly cop?
<s> That’s right. Where’s the fucking Italian, eh, Mr French hero?
<s> Emily...
<s> Have we done business before?
<s> Jee... Fuck... You’re fucking mad!
<s> Where is he?
<s> Finsbury Park. We’re in Finsbury Park.
<s> Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
<s> Got it. Puppies.
<s> Should I?
<s> Your secretary, huh!
<s> Spitz. We spoke on the telephone.  My husband...  My daughter, Deborah, whose house this is.  My son-in-law, Carlos...  The gentleman is a business partner of his. 
<s> We conclude our transaction.
<s> Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
<s> Look, I don’t think you’re fully aware of what you’re playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why don’t you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh?
<s> Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who can’t do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
<s> Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where they’re not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you?
<s> Ho-hotel... Los Angeles... He...
<s> Three o’clock.
<s> This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. I’m terribly sorry to disturb you but there’s been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
<s> Shut up!
<s> Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
<s> ... No.
<s> How’s the boy doing?
<s> Good. You needn’t worry about the Austrian anymore. He’s dead. I’ll be in touch.
<s> Où est passé ton salon?
<s> Then why don’t you reach him?
<s> What do you think, huh?
<s> Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...
<s> But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
<s> Now?
<s> This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
<s> Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?
<s> Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that?
<s> What... what do you mean?
<s> Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
<s> Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
<s> I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
<s> I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
<s> Oh yes, my lady.  All true kings of France must first be anointed in our great cathedral of Rheims... with the holy oil of Clovis... for it was within these very walls that Saint Remy received the sacred oil from Heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of King Clovis...
<s> We want her burned as a witch!
<s> ... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
<s> I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church.  Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
<s> Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.
<s> I don't know what you're going to ask me questions about.  You may ask things that I won't want to answer.
<s> Not unless you hear my confession.
<s> Many things...
<s> I am sent by God, and I submit all my words and deeds to His judgment. Or do you think that you are better judges than He is?
<s> Don't look at the cost, look at what it brings.  What is your last offer?
<s> I'm... I'm not the king...
<s> What difference does it make where she comes from?
<s> My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
<s> ... to ensure our privacy.  I need to talk to her.  Alone.
<s> There's no time, sire -- we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...
<s> Noooo!
<s> I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
<s> We offer the English a last chance to return home in peace.  If they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here -- at the Tourelles.
<s> That'll put fire in my soldiers!
<s> Yes.  We can pray.
<s> Perfectly.
<s> I care!  And I care because God cares!  All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...
<s> Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess...
<s> It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same.  Why must you complicate what is so simple?
<s> Nothing... just taking his teeth.
<s> They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
<s> God knows, but it was a bad idea!
<s> Nothing.  I'm here to set you free...
<s> If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
<s> No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!
<s> What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
<s> Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
<s> In His name??
<s> Do you think this cross will protect you?
<s> Do you think you are ready?
<s> Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
<s> Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
<s> And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
<s> Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.
<s> You can't, it's too dangerous.
<s> You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
<s> Dorota.
<s> He'll be back before curfew.
<s> Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.
<s> Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
<s> Just shut up.
<s> You don't know, believe me. They bribe the guards. The guards turn a blind eye. They're bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn.
<s> You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
<s> You'll be deported.
<s> You're amazing, Jehuda.
<s> I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news.
<s> Since last night. I was pleased to see you.
<s> Out of Warsaw. Where?
<s> I was... I was trying to open this tin.
<s> No sound at all?
<s> She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.
<s> I'll be back.
<s> No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.
<s> She's stunted, that's one thing.
<s> On your property?
<s> You mean in signs?
<s> What are they?
<s> What happened?
<s> Tomorrow.
<s> Naw, it's okay.
<s> He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
<s> Coupla days ago.  I'm workin' a big one with Gondorff on the North Side.
<s> You think my play is bad?
<s> Aw, I got a brother down in K.C., runs a freight outlet.  I can go halfsies with 'em!  It ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal.
<s> Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
<s> We'll be waitin'.
<s> Shove off, Duff.
<s> Aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya back.
<s> You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.
<s> I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
<s> Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
<s> And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.
<s> I never played for winos.
<s> You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?
<s> Ain't nothin' gonna make up for Luther, kid.  Revenge is for suckers.  I been griftin' 30 years and never got any.
<s> Fancies himself a gambler, huh?
<s> If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.
<s> Nice work, J.J.
<s> Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
<s> You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
<s> You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
<s> Yes, a ticket to Chicago.
<s> Where's June today?
<s> Yeh, sleepin'.
<s> He'd like to kill me.
<s> Yeh, this time anyway.
<s> You know me.  I'm just like you... It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody.
<s> Okay, Tootsie.
<s> How ya doin', Jimmy.
<s> Three grand on the black, Jimmy.
<s> That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
<s> Why don't ya then.
<s> Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.
<s> I don't know.  He took it hard.
<s> Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
<s> Never heard of the place.
<s> You know how they are... sex...
<s> Is that what it means?
<s> Just a minute...
<s> Said he stole his invention.
<s> Darling, you can't go through any more of this.  Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
<s> You've got to get your mind off this.
<s> Oh, Andy, Andy!
<s> Give it to me.
<s> You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
<s> It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Hello, there!
<s> tried him once -
<s> We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?
<s> I bought it in a pawn shop.
<s> Yes, she would.
<s> What's he want of you?
<s> What's that to you?
<s> No.
<s> Nothing yet to cinch it.
<s> I'll check on that.  I'm afraid this is kinder dull for you.
<s> No.
<s> Let's go and see.  Taxi!
<s> Nunheim!
<s> Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
<s> --was Wynant's.
<s> You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case.  Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?
<s> Oh, then you did hear from him?
<s> Goodbye.
<s> Want to take a poke at him?
<s> You don't think I had anything to do with it?
<s> Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
<s> How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
<s> You've said that for weeks.
<s> I said all right!
<s> Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
<s> Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
<s> What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
<s> What did you do with the rest?
<s> Would it help any if I could persuade him to meet you?
<s> Is Julia going with you?
<s> Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
<s> I haven't been a detective for four years.
<s> How do you do?  What did you say?....  He is?.... Where is he?  Very well.  He's back in town....  Wynant.  Thank heaven.  He's waiting for me now.  Forgive me, Mrs. Charles...  but I've been so upset.  It's no joke working for a man like that.  I must be off.  Goodbye....  Goodbye,
<s> What do you think?
<s> I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
<s> I didn't knock Julia off.
<s> I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her.  She was always on the up and up with me.  But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
<s> Listen.  "Studsy" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do  they....
<s> This is your party.
<s> I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.
<s> Much better, thanks.
<s> Take it easy.
<s> I wonder if they've --  I don't want to hear anything about it.
<s> She brought it in.  Trying to make me believe she did it.
<s> Maybe a drink would help you.
<s> Breakfast.
<s> Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
<s> What's the matter with you?
<s> I'm going to take Asta for a walk.
<s> I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
<s> You wouldn't be a widow long.
<s> Goodbye, darling.
<s> Huh?
<s> I remembered that Wynant had some shrapnel in his shin.  It often bothered him.  So I looked for it and I found it.  Gimme.
<s> Couple of months anyway.
<s> No.  Nobody but you.
<s> I can't help it. I can't tell a soul.  I didn't even tell Guild.
<s> I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
<s> I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.
<s> Yes.  Nick!
<s> I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!
<s> I'm fired.
<s> This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
<s> Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.
<s> No, please, not again.
<s> We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
<s> Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
<s> Maybe I do.
<s> Then get up and do something about it.
<s> Why'd he come in our camp.
<s> We thought--
<s> That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.
<s> It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you?
<s> Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
<s> Cool it, Jaeger.  Hey, Wes?  Wes?
<s> And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
<s> Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool.
<s> I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
<s> I know.  I know.  But I'm saying, if they knew.  We're going to be millionaires, man.  Millionaires!
<s> Faster we get there, faster we get back.
<s> Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
<s> I heard it.
<s> It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
<s> Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.
<s> So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for playing.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.
<s> They can't shoot us in here.
<s> I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
<s> What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line...
<s> It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
<s> We'll find our way.
<s> What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.
<s> Is it all right if I stand up?
<s> If we can find the Hummer, or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay. We've got enough water for that.  But we won't make another day otherwise.
<s> Okay.  Then we go this way.
<s> Place all alone like that?  Must be a boarder check point.
<s> Couldn't be Syria.  We couldn't have gone that far north.  It's got to be Saudi. Come on.
<s> Well, we should identify ourselves.
<s> Probably.
<s> I just said I would.  I don't think I--
<s> We can't stay here.  Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up.  Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.
<s> Shi'ites, I think.
<s> Somebody has to.
<s> Then I'm a rich man.
<s> What?
<s> Really?
<s> I could use some recon photos too.
<s> I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.
<s> It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
<s> Yeah, you're funny.
<s> I could.
<s> It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.
<s> I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
<s> A car is not just a car where I come from.  I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang--
<s> Oh, God!
<s> I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.
<s> Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
<s> That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
<s> Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
<s> We make it, or we go back empty handed.
<s> Yeah, we're down.
<s> The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler.  That's why they wear them.
<s> We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
<s> Cortex bonding....possible temporary.  Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?
<s> Now.
<s> Don't be so sure.
<s> That's not food.  Can't be food.
<s> What?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.
<s> Ask him about the air.  He looks out of breath.
<s> You have nothing to fear.  You're safe again.
<s> I want you for my roommate.
<s> We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself.  Would you like something?
<s> We'll never make it through that mainway...I wonder what happened to SEN.  I'm crazy!  This whole thing is crazy...What am I doing?  My mind is full of so many things I can't think of anything, anymore.  Who are you?
<s> You have to!....I'm 1138 THX Magnum manipulator 347 cell 94107 Precinct 3 Residence:  Level 6421 Complex 12 Ramp 5.  Roommate 3417 LU...H.
<s> I don't care.
<s> No!....
<s> I'm only trying to help you.
<s> I thought of something.....
<s> I can't understand.  The sedatives....
<s> Hang on.
<s> This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?
<s> Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.
<s> Where...?
<s> Industrial wood oil. Separately, any one of these things could lead in several directions, but together ...
<s> We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
<s> You got it.
<s> He has a timer going as back-up, in case we got a hold of the remote.  Okay... first, run your fingers along the edges, feel for a sensor.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Stay to your left.
<s> Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
<s> T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
<s> We work fast enough for you?
<s> We're a bit busy at the moment, I'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we're still alive.
<s> Taylor's dead.
<s> What? Nobody, I-
<s> A ticking bomb...
<s> And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, I'd like to make retirement in one piece.
<s> Nothing so far.
<s> What kind of bomb was it?
<s> I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail.
<s> Captain assigned me to assist you.
<s> You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches?
<s> Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
<s> And it had diamonds in the back.
<s> Tell M'sieu Giron I can't see him now. Impossible!  And, Jacques. Dismiss the car! Madame is not going. 
<s> A man in love, completely shaken. He sits on bed, thinks, then takes telephone slowly, decisively.
<s> I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...
<s> You've never been in Constantinople?
<s> I thought so.
<s> Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
<s> Yes, Baron?
<s> No, not at all!
<s> Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
<s> Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
<s> No, to you--M'sieu <u>Monescu</u>.
<s> M'sieu Monescu!
<s> Just as you say, Doctor.
<s> I would like to.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
<s> Sweetheart, what day is today?
<s> And her <u>jewelry</u> is worth a fortune!
<s> What?
<s> Yes!  Now don't worry!
<s> Spanish passports?
<s> Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Doña Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?
<s> Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
<s> Lily-- 
<s> Yes.
<s> I know that niche.
<s> I remember.
<s> Well--I am Madame Colet.
<s> M'sieu Laval!
<s> Peaches and cream.
<s> It <u>is</u> beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.
<s> This used to be my secretary's room.
<s> Lipstick?
<s> I know all your tricks.
<s> Please! 
<s> Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
<s> Yes--uh--
<s> Yes, madame!
<s> He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
<s> An hour, two at most.
<s> About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here.  But it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So I was over-ruled.
<s> Yes, I understand. Thank you.
<s> I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
<s> You are, Lewis.  You rolling?
<s> You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.
<s> Lewis...
<s> It's hers, you schmuck.  Look, Rose, I... I don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is... we're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... think about this a second.
<s> I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
<s> Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance.  Come on.
<s> I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
<s> The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
<s> I was tired.
<s> Can I bum a cigarette?
<s> I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
<s> Of course not. That's not the point.  Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
<s> I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
<s> I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
<s> I've got you. I won't let go.
<s> Could I speak to you in private?
<s> That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
<s> Is he your boyfriend?
<s> Just some sketches.
<s> She had beautiful hands.
<s> I see you.
<s> Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
<s> Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
<s> I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
<s> He does landscapes.
<s> Au contraire, mon cher.
<s> It's okay. I'm alright.
<s> Could it have damaged the ship?
<s> I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.
<s> That's enough.
<s> What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.
<s> Just tell us what you can --
<s> How can you put this on my shoulders?
<s> Goodbye, mother.
<s> Sure!
<s> Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
<s> I'll join you later.
<s> I can explain--
<s> Will you leave me alone?
<s> Glad to see you again.
<s> We'll save you a place at our table.
<s> Yes--and <U>very</U> popular-- 
<s> Thanks, no. I despise any form of exercise.  Don't forget we have an engagement for cocktails and cards.
<s> Isn't that interesting?
<s> I'm going down to my cabin. I have to send a wireless-- see you later.
<s> That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?
<s> I'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em--Why, a high-school kid could take you saps--and another thing--Lay off Sally Marsh.  --"Honest Jack"! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets.
<s> I'll say she is!
<s> Never eat before the show.
<s> Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
<s> You asked me to dine with you tonight.
<s> At seven-thirty?
<s> Anything I can do?  I'd jump overboard if it'd help you.
<s> Good night, idiot!
<s> Jimmy!
<s> Shortie, look!
<s> Now you're talkin'!
<s> You take some awful chances.
<s> Thank you.  I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
<s> What is it?
<s> <U>Me</U>!
<s> Oh, yes. On the pier.
<s> I'll go with you--
<s> Anybody that's taken the trouble to get it would be a mug to put it back.
<s> Tell you what I'll do.  I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
<s> I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
<s> She did?
<s> What'll I say?
<s> That's right. I owe you a dollar sixty.
<s> Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
<s> <U>Nuts</U> to you too!
<s> I thought I put you to bed.
<s> She's in New York.
<s> I was never stiffer in my life.
<s> Like it?
<s> No--not much--excepting-- 
<s> Do what--
<s> I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
<s> What do you mean?
<s> What's he got that I haven't got?
<s> No--He's probably one of the "Here's How."  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--
<s> Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story.
<s> Thanks to me.
<s> Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
<s> I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
<s> For a very excellent reason from your own admission--  --I'm not saying you <U>did</U>--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it.
<s> Do you think Lother could have seen it?
<s> You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
<s> Let me look at it.
<s> Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
<s> Fine, fine.  But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
<s> Yes, very.  And very married.
<s> Make you a deal.  My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone.  Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans.  You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.
<s> They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?
<s> Well... 'bye.
<s> But wait, you don't understand-
<s> You retired, too?
<s> I was kidding about that.
<s> Bless you, darling  Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!
<s> I been having the boy at the Hotel pack us up every night Since your streak started
<s> I know him.  That's Creek Johnson.
<s> You know damn well who I mean. That dusky-hued lady Satan.
<s> Ignore her?
<s> I don't know.  It all happened so Fast.  If I'd had a chance to Think about it I guess I probably Would've been scared but... Swear To God, Doc, I just don't know.
<s> What?
<s> Good God, you're really-
<s> Yeah.  Or undertakers.
<s> It rides right at 'em.  Like McMasters said, see it through to The end.
<s> Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.
<s> I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy?
<s> You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?
<s> Look, it's too much of a tangle. I already cast my lot.  I can't go Back and I can't sneak, feel back Enough as it is.
<s> All right, well, good night.
<s> Sure I'm sure.  What is this?
<s> Forget it, Ringo.
<s> No?  Brothers to the bone, right?
<s> All right, run 'em off.
<s> We'll go around that way, come up on foot.
<s> Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.
<s> I'll be damned...
<s> Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights.  Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all.
<s> I'm the one made a mess.  Made a Right fair mess of the whole thing.
<s> Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
<s> Sure...
<s> I know, I need a keeper.
<s> No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law.
<s> Yeah, and dangerous.
<s> - Thank you, M. But this is more than your man can handle.  Are we in agreement?
<s> I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
<s> You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.
<s> They're merely tools to disseminate information.
<s> Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
<s> Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor...  And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
<s> - Four wheel drive?
<s> Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed CIA cowboy -  Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide.
<s> He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!
<s> Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
<s> Something with an engine? Not oars?
<s> Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
<s> Hell. The CIA built that club.
<s> - And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
<s> No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.
<s> And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
<s> I see my date is here.  And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
<s> You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.
<s> Think about mom.
<s> - The family jewels?
<s> He was my father's best friend!
<s> My father left me the business.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Cleans dirt. Let's go.
<s> It seems, 007, we've received a tip
<s> ... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?
<s> I understand.
<s> Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
<s> I am. What do you want?
<s> Captain Morton.
<s> Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
<s> Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
<s> Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground.
<s> Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
<s> - I told you! He was there! -
<s> Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
<s> This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
<s> I would like to finish reading this. What would I talk about? I haven't read this month's almanac. I don't care to hear about how the corn was this fall or how to get rid of gophers by putting garlic in their holes. They pride themselves in making life hard and that's not my cup of tea.
<s> Why in the h...
<s> This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
<s> It is just a regular card.
<s> Look! Don't try to get ahead by riding our backs.
<s> Just stay in bed and rest.
<s> You must have been really sick.
<s> You better come sit down. You are still sick.
<s> I tell you, I feel like a ghost.
<s> You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.
<s> Good afternoon to you.
<s> Wasn't Hocker lynched?
<s> Strange as it may seem, it might have cleared the waters. Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason.
<s> "Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly."
<s> Oh. I'm sorry. Gideon, what do you say?
<s> I thought you weren't old fashioned.
<s> No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.
<s> I haven't heard anyone mention Swamp Root since button-up shoes went out.
<s> He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
<s> Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock.
<s> I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
<s> But Mom, I can't find him!
<s> But what if we leave them behind?
<s> Well sure, look at him.  He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife.
<s> I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
<s> You can't!
<s> What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!
<s> Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
<s> Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
<s> Sorry.
<s> Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
<s> Years of Academy training...wasted!!
<s> Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
<s> We've got to get out of here...NOW.
<s> Woody!
<s> Hold still, Buzz!
<s> Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
<s> I can't see a thing!
<s> Sorry there, old Spudhead.
<s> Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
<s> Yes SIR!
<s> Last present!
<s> Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up. I know you're tired!  I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me?
<s> Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.
<s> Slink!  Hang on!
<s> I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.
<s> Go away.
<s> Do what?  Oh, I see.
<s> H'm?
<s> So had I.
<s> Why are you talking like that?
<s> Barbara --
<s> So's the video camera.
<s> Tell me what to do, Carl.  I need guidance, not a fucking platitude.  I'm not bringing a child into the kind of life I grew up with.  I won't do it.  I want our life back.
<s> How long's the job?
<s> Sixteen
<s> I get A's.  All A's.
<s> What is this, like freebase?
<s> He's gonna fucking die right here on the kitchen floor --
<s> Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
<s> I feel good.
<s> It's a funny fuckin' joke and it's quick.  Why do women wear makeup and perfume?
<s> Depends on the state.
<s> No --
<s> I have a job for you and I don't have much time.
<s> Yes, sir!
<s> You don't?  Listen to this woman in a man's world, a very violent world.
<s> But not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt.
<s> I don't know.  Perhaps I remember something.
<s> Who?
<s> Your new friends.
<s> What?
<s> No.
<s> An informant.
<s> Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians.
<s> What do you look for?
<s> What kind of research?
<s> It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
<s> Bit fucking late, like.
<s> Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
<s> If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail.
<s> I've no fucking cigarettes.
<s> Right. You can't sleep here.
<s> Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
<s> Smells like it.
<s> It's Iggy Pop.
<s> That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
<s> Well, he's young and he's healthy.
<s> It's an interesting theory.
<s> What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
<s> Fuck, OK.
<s> Of course, the motto, the motto --
<s> Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.
<s> The pleasure was mine. Best interview I've ever been to. Thanks.
<s> No problem.  No problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood.
<s> Right.
<s> And you might get the fucking job.
<s> One hundred and sixteen minutes.
<s> Lewis Gilbert.
<s> But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.
<s> Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
<s> OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
<s> Despite the Academy award?
<s> What's wrong, Allison?
<s> It wasn't that bad.
<s> What?
<s> He made me lick it.
<s> It's a nightmare. She told me she didn't want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally defined from then on in.
<s> Estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
<s> The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. And they've taken hostages.
<s> With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
<s> Oh, please.
<s> Join my quest.
<s> What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.
<s> Beam up Spock and Dr. McCoy. Now!
<s> Go, Sulu.
<s> I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.
<s> I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
<s> Because it's there.
<s> I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.
<s> That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
<s> Yes, Captain.
<s> An eternity during which we'll be vulnerable to Klingon attack. Korrd-you tell him.
<s> Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
<s> Hmmm?
<s> If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
<s> It's all right, Captain.  Proceed.
<s> James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
<s> In order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we're going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually.
<s> You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
<s> I'm afraid of nothing.
<s> I've done nothing. This is who they are. Didn't you know that?
<s> The ship needs its Captain.
<s> Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.
<s> No. You must kill me.
<s> Do you?
<s> Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
<s> I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
<s> You call that getting over it?
<s> That Dillinger's on to him.
<s> Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
<s> Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
<s> Oui, da, yessiree, sure 'nuff, you betcha.
<s> Right on the money!
<s> Yeah, I... oops!
<s> Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere...
<s> Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play video games better than anybody.
<s> Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
<s> Recognizers!
<s> Little more juice's all it needs...
<s> Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system?
<s> That's right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here ... What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.
<s> Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
<s> Do it!
<s> Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape... they've never built circuit that could hold you...
<s> Don't know yet... I have to get in touch with Alan. He was going to tell me how to
<s> Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
<s> I can't. There's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!
<s> Just an hour?  You should tell this stud to take more time.
<s> Where are you going?
<s> Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
<s> Yeah, Dad.
<s> Fine.
<s> Dad.  You just think you know everything, don't you?
<s> What?
<s> She knows not to steal.  I've taught her better than that.
<s> No way.  Not Dana.
<s> And make it fast.  My horse is getting tired.
<s> Goddammit!  That's outrageous.
<s> I still don't believe it.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
<s> Why not?  You think I can afford a suite like that on my salary? Is Jean-Claude done yet?						*
<s> It's show time.  Don't look at					* the flash.  Do not look at the flash.
<s> But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  I mean--
<s> You're not going anywhere.
<s> Those wimps.  It's because I use				* my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going.
<s> My husband the hero.
<s> Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it.
<s> Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company.
<s> Answer the question--
<s> Do you still love your husband?
<s> Yes or no.
<s> You will be contacted with the assignment.
<s> I'm not wearing any.
<s> What about Juno?
<s> Absolutely.
<s> Red hot.  Her thighs steam.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> You recognized my style.  See, you're very good.  You're a natural at this.
<s> It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.
<s> It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
<s> You can't have just one.
<s> How 'bout me what?
<s> Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".
<s> Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
<s> I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.
<s> That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks like?
<s> What would make you think that?
<s> I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.  I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.
<s> It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."
<s> No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.
<s> You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
<s> That rhymes.
<s> I heard that.
<s> Heard that.
<s> Me thinketh he doth protest too much.
<s> You don't like it, but you eat that shit.  He eats it.
<s> Take that shit somewhere else.
<s> I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
<s> She's with me.
<s> Tomorrow.
<s> Get the fuck outta here!
<s> Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
<s> Tell me.
<s> It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.
<s> He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
<s> I'm just makin' sure we got everything.  You got yours?
<s> I don't blame you.  So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?
<s> Want an animal cracker?
<s> - that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -
<s> Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
<s> No problems on both counts.
<s> They'll be along.
<s> I guess so. Follow me.
<s> Yeah?
<s> You are the dumbest person in the world.
<s> Have you read the story on Elvis?
<s> Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
<s> She seems very nice.
<s> Do you still have friends on the force?
<s> Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
<s> No.
<s> Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence -
<s> McTeague.
<s> Sure was.
<s> Or a supporting actor -
<s> 'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore -
<s> Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.
<s> To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
<s> Naw, man, it ain't white boy day.
<s> Nigger, you lie like a big dog.
<s> Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say?
<s> You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
<s> I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
<s> I'm not wearing a bra.
<s> Where's that?
<s> Donowitz, he said.
<s> No, sir!  I just want to do my part. To get us back on top...in charge of the planet.  And I have the experience, I know who the people are...
<s> Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
<s> Meaning...???
<s> So that...???
<s> "James"!  Nobody ever calls me that.
<s> No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
<s> What year is it?
<s> No more drugs.  Please...
<s> 1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!
<s> You're flushed.  And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever.  What are you doing?
<s> I did him a favor.  Now come on.
<s> Shot!  Who shot you?
<s> No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
<s> No, I want to turn myself in.  Where is he?  Don't worry -- it's all okay now.  I'm not crazy any more!  I mean, I am crazy, mentally divergent, actually, but I know it now and I want you to help me.  I want to get well...
<s> We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
<s> It was?  I didn't...know.
<s> You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...
<s> You... you left them a message?
<s> They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.
<s> No, no.  I can't talk to them.  It's called, "voice mail".  I'm supposed to leave messages. They monitor it from the present.
<s> I need to make a telephone call.
<s> It's private.
<s> Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load!  Listen up -- try and get it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan! Remember?  I did my part.
<s> I'm here about some monkeys.
<s> Listen to me -- I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything.  I can't stop you.  I just want some information...
<s> How did you find me?
<s> They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he knew about the boy in Fresno and he says three billion people are going to die!
<s> Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"?
<s> Then how come she knows what's going on?
<s> On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
<s> I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
<s> He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
<s> See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then . . .
<s> Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
<s> We was born to die, boy.  From the minute you take your first breath you got a death sentence hanging over your head.  You just don't know where, or when, or how.  Don't make sense worryin' about the particulars.
<s> Out of here.
<s> So?
<s> I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
<s> Ninety-two.  Only gonna get hotter. I remember one time . . .
<s> Hey, your . . . what the hell happened to you.
<s> You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
<s> Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
<s> Baby didn't die.  Just froze off all it's finger and toes.  Just a little fingerless, toeless boy now.  But the husband; he sees what the wife's done, so after he saves the baby he locks the wife in the refrigerator to see how she likes it.  Now she died.
<s> Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
<s> I think I burned my gun hand!
<s> What do you want?
<s> They look nice.
<s> Those are white words, not ours.
<s> It tells me what every face tells me.  Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
<s> Like they're made of polyester.
<s> Games?
<s> If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
<s> Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
<s> From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
<s> From?
<s> One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
<s> The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
<s> We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.
<s> After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I'm not sure where it is.  Not exactly.  I never saw it.  I just heard him talk about it.
<s> Don't yell at me!
<s> I told you.  I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?
<s> We're going all the way.  Together.
<s> What about him?
<s> Thirty-thousand, that's all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didn't have to kill him.
<s> But I want to say with you,
<s> I'm here.
<s> You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
<s> Why don't you come down and get them so I can wring your pretty little neck?
<s> Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
<s> Because I'm sick and tired of her little games.  Because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. Because I've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and I would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it.
<s> No.
<s> About things.  About your wife.
<s> About what you said this morning.
<s> I do.
<s> I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
<s> Do we shake hands?
<s> How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before.  I guess I should have hired a professional.
<s> Maybe you heard old Jake's got some money stashed away and you thought you'd help yourself to a little.
<s> You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
<s> That's a lot of talk.  A whole lot of talk.
<s> Come on, Jake--
<s> Think about it.  How do you think I got in here?  Did you hear any glass break?  Did you hear a door splinter?  How did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit?  Maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  Is that what happened?
<s> What?
<s> She's dead.
<s> What the hell are you talking about?
<s> Oh, shit!
<s> I'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin' nothing but soup the rest of your days.  Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when I'm done. I'm gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick.  I'm gonna . . .
<s> I guess.
<s> There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
<s> Killing Jake McKenna's got to amount to something.  He wasn't much of a man, but that don't give you the right to murder him.  And don't tell me you didn't, 'cause I know you did.  I was there.  Like I said; I been watching you.
<s> Thirty-thousand dollars.
<s> You want something?
<s> I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
<s> I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
<s> That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
<s> 'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
<s> You idiot!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
<s> Who the hell are you?
<s> It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
<s> What makes you say that?
<s> That's a bit much.
<s> How do you want it?
<s> Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...
<s> Don't Jake me boy! It's a big house. You probably didn't even make it out to the desert this afternoon...
<s> Two-hundred dollars...I'll do it!  I'll kill her!
<s> What?
<s> I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
<s> He's up at the Look Out.
<s> Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
<s> 'Cause Harlin used to own it.
<s> Yeah, I can fix it.
<s> You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
<s> Bottom hose was shot too.  Rotted clear through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like a dream now.
<s> You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
<s> Darrell.
<s> You sure you can manage?
<s> You're welcome, Grace.
<s> Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
<s> Come here.
<s> It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
<s> Like you.
<s> I have an idea.
<s> They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
<s> Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Is it pretty?
<s> Honey, baby, I <u>can't</u>. I can't even get out of here <u>myself</u>. Believe it or not, I need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic...
<s> At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.
<s> Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
<s> I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
<s> Good thinking.  What's all this?
<s> Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
<s> I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
<s> Bobby? Are you all right?
<s> Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
<s> A hundred and ... Now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and <u>I want it</u>.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
<s> No.  Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.
<s> What was that all about?
<s> Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
<s> You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you.
<s> No! No! Please!
<s> I said come on!
<s> I want my lawyer!
<s> Wow.
<s> I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
<s> I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay.  I think that was the first time.  Does that count?
<s> I don't know Megan.
<s> In college. A car accident.
<s> You've misunderstood.
<s> We've already begun.
<s> Are you for real?
<s> You thought he was carrying a knife?
<s> Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.
<s> That's not what I witnessed David.
<s> Yes he is.
<s> No.
<s> How much can you lift?
<s> I mean if you knew karate?
<s> Is David Dunne there?
<s> I told you, he don't have no wife, not aboveground, anyhow.
<s> Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
<s> They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.
<s> I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
<s> Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
<s> I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
<s> I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?
<s> Oh yeah.
<s> Those cowboys messin' him up?
<s> Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
<s> You could run off them two cowboys.
<s> Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
<s> But he was called...
<s> Is... is it... loaded?
<s> Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
<s> Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
<s> Same one as shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?
<s> Well, how about it?
<s> If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
<s> You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
<s> I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
<s> You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Two weeks, I guess.
<s> It's just... she's a Indian an' Indians ain't... overfriendly.
<s> Well, she...
<s> I didn't see nothin' planted.
<s> Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
<s> Why would the Kid shoot at us?
<s> I remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
<s> You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?
<s> I seen the angel of death Ned, an' I seen the river.  He's a snake, he got... snake eyes.
<s> The angel... the angel of death. I'm scared, Ned. Ned, I'm gonna die.
<s> I guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
<s> I don't like the question.
<s> Bear with me here...
<s> And ?
<s> &lt;&lt;I'll tell you everything. I'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt;
<s> &lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
<s> Goddamnit.
<s> They'll never stop.
<s> I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York?
<s> County. I was in for fraud.
<s> Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
<s> You okay?
<s> Maybe more.
<s> I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.
<s> This I had to see myself.
<s> You know damn well, dead-man.
<s> Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
<s> Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition. I requested she be put on the case personally. She flew out yesterday.
<s> Two hours, tops.
<s> Someplace else, then.
<s> I know he was good.
<s> You know a religious guy named John Paul?
<s> I'm not a rat.
<s> I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.
<s> McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
<s> Wait a minute.
<s> I don't
<s> Keaton was Keyser Soze
<s> He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.
<s> I'm not bait. No way. I post today.
<s> Counselor, you're bluffing. Shall I push for misdemeanor two?
<s> I'm fine.
<s> No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
<s> Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...
<s> Yes.  It would be.
<s> That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone.  She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends --and the people who should care for her:  her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way.  We have been paid to look the other way.  I came in here to take your money.   I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.   I can't take it.  If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.    I can't do it. I can't take it.
<s> Gruber...
<s> Frank Galvin's ... who's calling please?  Bishop Brophy's office ...
<s> Don't equivocate.  Be positive. Just tell the truth.
<s> I was her doctor.
<s> When she...
<s> `Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.'  Yes.
<s> I am seventy-four years old.
<s> I wouldn't do it.
<s> No.
<s> Yes.
<s> I . . ..
<s> I doubt we'll have to go to trial ...
<s> No.  No.  Thank you. You go home.
<s> Yes.  I wrote it.
<s> Yes.
<s> Negligent.  Yes...it would have been criminal.  But that was not the case.
<s> That's perfectly all right.  I'm kind of rushed.  Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
<s> Whose side are you arguing ...?  I thought that you wanted to do something.  I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going  to ... I have an interest in the Hospital;  and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid.  You caught 'em.  Now: how many others did they kill?
<s> What are they going to do?  Not invite me to their Birthday party ...?   Look, I gotta go.  I have to be in Cambridge ...
<s> I understand.
<s> Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
<s> Well, maybe you better do that, then.   You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores.  You'd do anything for a dollar.  You got no loyalty...no nothing...you're a bunch of whores.
<s> My client can't walk, your Honor.
<s> Ready, your Honor.
<s> What?
<s> How come you're calling me from...?
<s> Kathy Price.
<s> We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work.
<s> What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
<s> I think I will.
<s> Maybe what?
<s> Isn't there something you...
<s> I...
<s> And what makes you so tough?
<s> I don't have a goddamned idea.
<s> What do you want?
<s> I know what I said but not now. You won it.  Franky.  You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won.  We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?  You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.
<s> Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back.
<s> I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse?
<s> Oh shit, what's today?
<s> I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have?
<s> ...one of the other nurses?
<s> The 'History'...?
<s> Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
<s> I don't want to leave her.  Dick ...the, the ... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will ...
<s> We, yes.  Yes.  They, they present their side, and I get the same chance.  To cross-examine... to... to...
<s> You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
<s> Yes.
<s> Thanks, Franky.
<s> We, we were rather busy...
<s> Yes.
<s> It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.
<s> I married into it.
<s> Almost a year.
<s> More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
<s> Have you talked to the doctors at all?
<s> All right.  You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie. Even I, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. She looks so lovely and normal...
<s> Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
<s> Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
<s> No, you don't owe me anything.
<s> An hour?
<s> Tomorrow morning.
<s> Don't go.
<s> No, Judy, you don't understand.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
<s> Yes.
<s> Wherever you'd like...
<s> Is that the best you can do?
<s> No, Ernie's is fine.
<s> Your accident...
<s> I loved you, Madeleine.
<s> Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
<s> I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
<s> Not at all, I enjoyed --
<s> Good-bye.
<s> If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
<s> Only silence. It's always like this.
<s> What?!
<s> I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...
<s> No, never!
<s> Too late... there's something I must do...
<s> When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
<s> What car?
<s> Johnny, the doctors explained --
<s> To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
<s> What a pleasant hobby.
<s> Normal.
<s> Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
<s> How?
<s> Okay.
<s> Do you know him well?
<s> All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat?
<s> Nothing to tell.
<s> Bye-bye!
<s> Oh?
<s> Did you need it?
<s> Oh?
<s> But you said grey, sir.
<s> Can we have it by tonight?
<s> Don't touch her. Call 911.
<s> What?
<s> First of all...
<s> You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
<s> You want to hear me out?
<s> Calling the ambulance.
<s> Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
<s> What about the blood?
<s> That is absolutely not true.
<s> I am not flexible on this.
<s> What does that mean?
<s> There is no candy!
<s> I know and I'm honored...
<s> I know...
<s> It has to be done.
<s> Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
<s> Don't sweet lip me.
<s> Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
<s> So who's the lucky guy?
<s> She's still working?
<s> Left side.
<s> What is her disposition?
<s> Good God...Good God...
<s> However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
<s> What did you ask me?
<s> What you just said. Say it again.
<s> You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes.
<s> I don't think that's such a good idea.
<s> Fine? Fine what?
<s> You need help.
<s> Moore?
<s> Goosed!
<s> We missed the deadline.
<s> I think so.
<s> I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
<s> Yup.
<s> Yes.
<s> How could I know what else I forgot?
<s> I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.
<s> I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this.
<s> Of course.
<s> I'll call them from the road.
<s> I love you.
<s> I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
<s> I'm working on it.
<s> "At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long..."
<s> Now?
<s> Can we just talk this out?
<s> Yeah. You.
<s> Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
<s> No Micheal did. It was an accident.
<s> She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
<s> But...
<s> What does that mean?
<s> You put him down or don't bother coming back.
<s> Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!
<s> OK, OK. You guys just go back in. Dad, keep going with the toast, we'll be right in. Go on.
<s> Go for it.
<s> I think so.
<s> That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never.
<s> I don't think that's a good idea.

<s> Don't you ever see him?
<s> You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.
<s> It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
<s> Thank you; but it's missing something.
<s> It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.
<s> What are you going to do?
<s> One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I?
<s> These chairs are in good condition. With a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable.

<s> I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.
<s> When you are, miss.
<s> That's enough.  Go join the others, and don't come back here.  And you'll have to control your temper.

<s> Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
<s> Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.

<s> How did you get your hand out?
<s> I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
<s> No! Grimes isn't back. He's only one part of Sid. Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was.  Get a hold of yourself!

<s> Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.

<s> Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
<s> You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.

<s> Go away!  I don't want you here.
<s> What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
<s> Leave me alone!
<s> Ju1ien was your father   Your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father. All one in the same...  That is why he fought carlotta for your life.

<s> I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
<s> Suzie?
<s> Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her.  I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?
<s> Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
<s> Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
<s> You got it.  The rich got richer.  While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp.
<s> You don't think Sam could've put it there?
<s> The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
<s> No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
<s> What about witnesses?
<s> I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.

<s> Yes.  God, Mom...
<s> Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?
<s> Mr. Lombardo.  We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.
<s> So you got my mom's money.
<s> Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.
<s> Hello.
<s> Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
<s> And you believe her?
<s> Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
<s> I did.  At Blue Balls.
<s> Will they?
<s> Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Get him in the water.
<s> And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her.
<s> Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
<s> That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
<s> Good.  Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.
<s> Are you mad at me?
<s> Funny.  So am I.
<s> Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
<s> No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.
<s> What about the explosive?
<s> Almost?

<s> Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
<s> Imposserous!
<s> Whozat?
<s> Not nohow!
<s> Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?
<s> Ohhhh -- it's me!
<s> Ohhhhhh!
<s> I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart of not.  Bee-hive -- bah!  Let her try and make a bee-hive out of me! You know -- Hmm? What's that?
<s> We do.
<s> It's the Wicked Witch!  What'll we do? Help!  HELP!
<s> Ho -- ho --ho
<s> I can fairly hear my heart beating!
<s> Oh - look out.
<s> Now, now, don't fret.
<s> You put up a great fight, Lion.
<s> Well, I --
<s> Well, I --
<s> Help!
<s> So who are you?
<s> Makes her look even more innocent.
<s> But what if...
<s> We can’t.
<s> Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. He’s a man of great integrity.
<s> She’s not a girl anymore.
<s> Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle.  Largest landlocked body of water on Earth.  Oil-rich.  Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it.
<s> I was the one who brought that money in...
<s> The worm on the hook again.
<s> Who did you get it from?
<s> Your last chance. Give me the name.
<s> Yes.
<s> Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
<s> Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
<s> I think you’re one of the bravest people I’ve ever met.
<s> Someone wants to kill me, I’d rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
<s> You had your chance, James. Now I’m looking for a bigger thrill.
<s> Shush.
<s> Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
<s> Five more turns and your neck will break.
<s> No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.
<s> Bond, I’m a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal family’s, now it’s mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
<s> How high up does this...arms dealing go?
<s> No!  Get me out!
<s> This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!
<s> Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.
<s> Could...could you come?
<s> Your father...
<s> You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
<s> Who is she?  Do you know her?
<s> You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
<s> You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
<s> Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
<s> 
<s> Damn straight!  We were heroes.
<s> Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
<s> Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
<s> The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
<s> What are you up to?
<s> It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
<s> All right.  Mission accomplished.
<s> What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
<s> Those cars.  What year is this??
<s> Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
<s> I don't know their real names!
<s> What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
<s> Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
<s> I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
<s> I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
<s> Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
<s> No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.
<s> A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
<s> You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
<s> If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
<s> My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
<s> I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
<s> Yes it does.
<s> I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
<s> We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
<s> The scum of the Earth.
<s> He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
<s> We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.
<s> Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?
<s> Mind your business.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> They'll kill you, you know they will. Besides, there is no back door. Keep smiling. Ready? Now.
<s> It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
<s> You don't have to do that.
<s> Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
<s> Go to the water, it's that way!
<s> A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.
<s> It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.
<s> It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.
<s> Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
<s> I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.
<s> That one I'm real familiar with.
<s> I'm through, Xander.
<s> I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
<s> Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
<s> I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
<s> Yeah, thanks a lot.
<s> A parachute. This does not argue well.
<s> It'll work faster if I have an account number.
<s> That's what I'm talking about, man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born.
<s> That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
<s> Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
<s> Its core?
<s> For what purpose?
<s> I don't like him being here.
<s> His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
<s> I don't remember.  Is that what you wanted to ask me?
<s> Some cigars.  Case of beer.
<s> I won't light the cigars - how about that?
<s> He takes his work seriously.
<s> Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
<s> The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
<s> A piece.  Only a piece.
<s> What do you want with him?
<s> Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me.
<s> I know.
<s> Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
<s> Baack!
<s> MMmmm.
<s> You bet your boots it does.
<s> Goodbye, darling.
<s> Love you! ...Well, why don't we turn in?
<s> No, of course not.  I just meant...
<s> But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
<s> Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
<s> But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.
<s> Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
<s> What hump?
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> Why are you talking like that?
<s> What?
<s> No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.
<s> 'How I Did It.'  Good title!
<s> Could be raining!
<s> Was he any good?
<s> Can you imagine that brain in this body?
<s> He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
<s> All right... elevate me!
<s> What?
<s> I suppose you're right.  Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.
<s> You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
<s> For  God's sake -- go on!  Are you trying to make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur!  Sing!!
<s> No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
<s> Perhaps we'd better leave.
<s> Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...
<s> I thought it was wonderful.
<s> What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.
<s> Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
<s> MMMMmmmmm!
<s> The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
<s> Four
<s> Do Something!  Stall them!
<s> Food!
<s> I'm explaining my reasons.
<s> Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
