The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Why?
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
You got something on your mind?
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
It's more
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
But
Why didn't you tell me?
That's not
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
But she doesn't want to date.
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
You the new guy?
So -- which Dakota you from?
Get out!
That I'm used to.
You know French?
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Her favorite uncle
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
Hey.
You think this'll work?
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
William - he asked me to meet him here.
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
Why?
No, you weren't
Oh, so now you think you know me?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
Put your right foot there --
Good call.
The duck?
Tell me something true.
Is that a request or a command?
No, I won't go with you
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
My insurance does not cover PMS
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
You think?
Kat a fan, too?
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
You're completely demented.
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
Viceroy of the West Indies.
And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
... and also to bring medicine.
How can you be so certain?
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
I am listening, my son.
May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
I suppose we're both old men now.
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
What's he doing?
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
Oh no!  No!  Shit!
I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
But it's...
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
What are you asking me?
Do you have coffee?
I don't want to drag you down with me.
Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
A cop?
Chief - mind if I take her?
Where is she?
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
Nah, I musta missed it.
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
Mind if I ride along with you?
I don't have a girlfriend.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
I kill someone famous.
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
How old are your kids?
Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?
Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
Hi, I'm Honey.
Give me the address!!
How much money are you carrying with you?
Who is he?
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
I can get you a job.
Viewer discretion advised!
I speak English.
You okay?
Yeah?  What kind?
Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright, I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.
Get outta here!
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
Yes, I thought so.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
Well, that's something.
You're kidding.
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
I am prepared to do that anyway.
CONTINUED
Oh, thank you very much.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
Any ideas about the colour?
That's true.
Yes, Hal, what's up?
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
I want to drive awhile.
Pay money?
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
I'm candy...
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
How about it?
I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
Last night.
Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
Half a million.
Where's the money?
Right, partner.
Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.
What about Luther?
Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
Yeah, I see her.
Why?
Notice something funny about that bus?
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
What the bell happened?
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
Billy Bear...
I don't think your gun's loaded...
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
Call me later.
Great place for lunch.
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?
You real down?
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
You sure?
How much?
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
Of course.
Leeloo's in trouble?
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
I just found a picture of you.
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
...Hello?
Hi Ma...
Are you listening to me, you ingrate!
30 seconds...
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
Apipoulai!
Apipoulai!
Which one?
You're nothing but a... a...
It's up to you now, Angel!
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
Why?... Why would you need me?
This is all that survived?
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
Wait or act.
Am I disturbing you?
Okay, I believe you.
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
I'd like to commission a work.  I'm a great admirer of yours.
I want to watch you work.
You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.
Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
Yeah, who's this?
Don't ask questions.
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine.  And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models.  And she never walked out.
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
You're making me very angry.
You almost went over your limit.
Big date tonight?
Not quite.
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
Where are your parents?
A daughter.
Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
Who is he?
What's next?
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
Nothing remotely like this.
I'm not positive this means anything.
One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...
Hello?
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
What was she running from?
Why do you think he did it?
I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.
So what's up?  What'd I miss?
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
Hey...wake up.
Where is he?
About him?
Where are we going?
I'm so sorry, honey...
Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.  I've got to go find Dan.
Did everyone call everyone?
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
Oh man!  I could've gone all night without looking at that.
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
Unidentified Flying Objects.
I don't know.
We're stuck tight!
Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!
Dave - !
A mass of jelly-like stuff came out of the thing, and caught our torpedo!
Now they feel it...down below.
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
As we near the Pole...
Swell!
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
Always has been.
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
You don't believe me?
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
Oh.
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
He's on to us!
It's not enough snow, not for tracking the bastards. No advantage there, kid.
They said.
Don't mind if I do.
No brag. Just fact.
Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me and Jill had a little argument. Jack, I got to get back, get back to town. Move this thing, will you? See if you can get back to the Town Hall before they get there, okay?
Where'd Twombley get shot?
Where'd you get the blood?
Saw him do it?
I just think you used to be bad.
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
Please don't cry. Please, honey.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
No problem. Look, I...
I still don't understand --
You don't mean that.
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
Who are you?
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
The other guy.
Rolfe.
Yeah.
No shit.
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
Get some sleep.
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
What about Margie?
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.
Then who shot him?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.
Daddy...
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
How we doing, Colonel?
They aren't answering their hails.
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
Can we do that?
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
Why?
Air Force One, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
We've already been inspected.
The rest of the secret service?
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
We copy. Stand by...  Tower?
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.
The fax machines.
The fax machines.
Where are we sending it?
Someone should give you a raise.
One.
White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
Yeah, right.
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
It's bait.  Don't take it.
Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation.
Twenty five minutes. They should be here any moment.
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
Ted, what's wrong?
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
You mean...
Roger.
Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
All right, it's a matter of death.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
Ah, won't you sit down?
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
George Zipp said that?
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
You got a telegram from head­quarters today.
Rain.
He's right on the heading.
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
Oh, I'd love to.
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
He didn't recognize me.
Kill them both.
Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?
Well... yes, quite possibly.
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
Back off, George.
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?
Who is he?
She's going to divorce me.
What was that about?
No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network.  And Harcourt--
What's this about, George?  I know that look.
No!  We must do this alone.
I never thought I'd say this, but -- for once in my life I think I'm willing to wait for back-up.
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
That where Anderson worked?
Can you dig up their Quarantine records in this thing?
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff.
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.
You did okay, Bishop.
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
No.  There's no way!
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
Hold at forty.  Slow circle of the complex.
We got problems.
The corner!  Ready?
Seventeen meters.
They're in the approach corridor.
It's game time.
Locked.
Sounds like you, Hicks.
Range twenty meters.
And how are we today?
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
Casey.  She's my only friend.
Yes, there are, aren't there.
I don't know, Newt.  That's the truth.
Gone.
Don't go!  Please.
Burke!  Open the door!
Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.
Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
Is there a part for me?
How do you know?
How was I? Tell me honestly.
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
No! No! No!
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
I think you're mad! You're really mad!
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
Yes!
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?
Excellency!
Then he didn't send you?
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
Upstairs.
I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.
Just one year.
I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
Your Majesty!
Why so?
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
It couldn't be better.
No, really!
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
Are you playing a trick on me?
Father -
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
Why? What has happened?
What medicine?
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
Well?
Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?
I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
What for?
I'm sorry. No.
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
How could I not?
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
You flatter me.
How long will you give me?
C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.
What are you doing, Herr Director?
What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
I don't think it was really decided, Director.
My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
About what?
Are they?
Well?
Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.
Here I am, my angel.
Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
Oh, Miss Price?
He's not?
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
What do you dream about?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
How old are you?
What? Oh, yes, please.
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
Bathroom.
Alex?
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
Anything.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
I've left those pills for you.
Hopeless. It's hopeless.
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations.
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
How long have I been here?
Lunatic?
How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
Go on, ask them.
What the hell was that all about?
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.
What's the plan?
Oh shit. What is that?
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
No, thank you, Doctor.
Hot chocolate?
Then you have some hot tea?
Sorry.
Say Matt, I'll have to have some money for those Manville payrolls.
About twenty-four thousand.
Yeah.
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?
Let me have ten bucks?
What's the matter, Charlie?
Mr. Dickson in yet?
I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!
Dickson, I'd like to talk to you about the bank.
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
Then what did you want to gamble for? If you'd have beat us out of fifty G's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? Well, we want our dough.
That don't do us any good.
What do you mean?
Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
know, but—
Me?
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
Doesn't that come next?
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals—  I think I will have a drink.
You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.
Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.
I'm feeling fine this morning.
Shall we let the people come in?
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Yes, of course.
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Why - well, I—
Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
Yes?
Helen!
Oh, make that uniform blue.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  Matt, do you realize you're up against something? You're being charged with murder. It's serious, son. Now come on, I know you didn't do it.  But we've got to make them believe it. Come on, tell the truth, where were you last night?
Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week.
Of course it's true - and he knows it.
Well, Sampson, what is it?
Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.
That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
The bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. This is just a flurry, that's all. They've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. Listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. Wait a minute. Get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. Tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?
Did you say Dude Finlay?
What time did Matt Brown get in?
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
I couldn't lose him.
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite.
These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.
I ain't done --
Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.
Fine. We hit this bank.
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
Bob, rip up some bandages.
Missed you, cousin.
Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want.
I think one of 'em's glass.
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
Of St. Louis?
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
Daddy, don't start with this again.
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
That just might work.
-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.
You know him?
And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
We're doing this for Ma.
You taking sides against me, now, Frank?
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
That he was.
How much of that story is true?
You're sick of my company?
Teasing you is completely unfair.
I shouldn't tease a hero.
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
You and I, we've started... something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this.
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?
Was it worth it?
I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
And you're too young.
You okay, Jesse?
You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
Well, this land is about to be condemned.
Good.
Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
With my money!
"A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West."
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
Yes?
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
You like it there, don't you?
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish. 
Why?
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...
This is nicer than your other apartment.
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
He's good-looking.
Are you using minoxidil?
Where are you going?
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Can I help you?
Carnes? Wait.
Excuse me. I really must he going.
Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer
Patrick? Is that you?
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
SHUT UP!
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
Don't, I'll drink it.
Who?
Yes, Patrick?
That is...if you're not doing anything.
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
Want a bite?
Interesting.
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.
Jean? What?
Patrick? I can't hear you.
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.
Don't tell him you're here.
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in...  Just joking...  No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it.  Sorry about that.
Well, what's the topic of discussion?
How old are you?
Where did you go to school?
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
Yeah. You know...hang out.
Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don.
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?" 
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence.
Well...I...Wait...What information have you received?
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
You're not what? Qualified for anything else?
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?
Speak up. Come on.
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?
You are a fanatic.
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
That took some fun out of --
I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --
They hack into people's programs?
It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top.
It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back.
The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when --
...wanna savor this.
That'll be a test, won't it?
What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.
My goodness.
Will I get to work for Outpost?
Is it your software?
Who's that?
'Think I should buy some originals?
How's it going?
You could've handwritten it.
Okay, #2.
Longitude 109 --
Gary?
...You wanna work -- here?
Come with me.
Lisa.
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
Did I say something?
That's great. I -- didn't know.
Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
He's out of prison?
The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.
Time?
We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
Why were you so careless?
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.
Why?!
...He knows.
Wanted to say goodbye to him...
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers.
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
Come in.
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
Hungry.
Thank you.
Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.
Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.
She's working on another lead right now.
Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
Carnies.
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby.
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
We can't just sit here, Austin.
Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.
Not a good time to lose one's head.
It says here, name Danger Powers.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.
No. Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite.  It does have an odd shape, sir.
Shut up.
But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...
Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
Right.
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
And how do you feel about that?
We don't label people here, Scott.
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
Flower ...
No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes.
London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world.
I resign.
The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.
Doctor Peel, I presume?
Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...
Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
Do you always drive this fast?
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
I could save you the trouble.
Because you always obey orders ...
You're playing games.
Our little paradise -- just made for two?
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.
I was getting to it.
The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...
Steed
Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately --
I was hoping you could tell me.
In your operation.
You with Mother or Father?
The last one you'll ever see.
You said ... one shot.
Look at that guy. What a hunk.
What?
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
Man, you're losing your audience.
You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.
Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
Cole, what the hell are you doing?
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.
I don't believe you.
I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.
What kind of job? I'm a housewife.
I hope Ilene's all right.
Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
I just want to be alone.
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
Are any of those right?
Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
Welcome, welcome, one and all.
Right in there, pal.
He look familiar?
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
You're late again, Rick.
Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.
Biggest in two battalions.
-- Knock it off!
...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do?
Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.
You gotta let me finish --
It doesn't go like that.
In the Field Museum once.
Sheep don't count.
What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.
Brian, look --
...Not now, Brian.
I had that fire. He didn't listen!
Hey, what are you doing here?
I'll handle it.
Thanks for the invite.
I was doing my job.
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
What the hell are you doing here?
In a word, Brian, what is this job all about?
Nice bunch of guys.
Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...
So what do you want me to do?
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
So, you surviving without me?
Really. Well, let's have a look at what else was "in your blood". I always look forward to getting these, they make such a nice collage for the bar... "Assistant Director, Sales, Aspen Snowmobile Tours..."
Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
Fireman shit?
Where's Sean?
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
I treated you better.
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
Yeah? When was the last time?
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
Nobody cares, Ronald.
-- Burn them.
-- Burn them.
Got a cause?
Alderman Swayzak.
We still haven't found a connection between the victims.
Is there a connection between them, Alderman?
Brown Downtown... There hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in --
Are you all right, honey?
That stuff'll kill you quick, man.
I forgive you.
It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.
Keep trying.
You truly are a dancing fool.
Yeah, him.
What's wrong with him?
I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
So that's what you been doing?
Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.
Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?
My tap shoes.
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
Four minutes ago.
I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
Yep, you guessed it.
And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive.
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
That's what I'm askin'.
Glad to meet you, too.  You are all your father talks about.
How long has my father been like this?
Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.
Same here.
The Jolly Nigger Bank.
Why'd you do that?
That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.
What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
You sing and dance?
Not her, the one with the little...
No, not that.  How 'bout...
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
...yes she did.
...not that time...
I slept too near where I fell out.
Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather.
The good stuff.
You don't read, do you?
You leave something out?
I know I won't be your puppet.
My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might.  But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him.
Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?
Has he sent the challenge yet?
Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?
Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?
Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.
Good gracious!  What is this?
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
Then you yield to me.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
You want my heart?
Will we always leave it at this?
Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.
Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more.
Was he cheated?
Good night, papa.
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
Sir, let those laugh that win.
Charming Schuvaloff.
Yeah, if you've slept.
I don't want to go --
We got -- I don't know, we got separated
Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
Yeah, right...
You too?
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
He -- He made me do it --
That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
Whose blood is that, Jay?
Why?
Why... why didn't you tell me?
Full clip to the body --
Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first...
I... I don't know...
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
How do you know?
Or you, Levi? When is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?
MAYBE WHAT --
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
Hostile and uncooperative.
Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --
The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, you're a murderer --
You made me look like an idiot --
We're in the middle of a murder case --
Something like that. You?
You're kidding.
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
You're off to a late start.
That was kid gloves?
But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
So what now?
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.
We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --
We need to talk --
What if I don't want it?
That's not true.
West?
I was freezing from the hurricane --
But you didn't see it, right?
Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first --
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --
I used it to start the fire --
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --
Sign here and here.  Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?
I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.
Welcome to ya. What's your name?
How long have you known my father?
Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
It's okay, just leave it.
Means when you dream about something that's going to happen.  Like one night, I had a dream where this crow came and told me, "Your Aunt is going to die." I was so scared I woke up my parents. They told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.
That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.
Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
You're not trying to run away?
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
When did you ever work in an office?
Son?
Dad!
Let's get out of here.
Where are we headed?
I can't imagine any place better than here.
It's me. Norther Winslow.
So what are you up to now?
Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.
You didn't become crazy.
I'm going to get started on dishes.
What happened?
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
Would you say you understand Josephine?
Was she one of your teachers?
That really happened?
You first.
Yeah it was okay.
The sets were good.
Yes.
What?
What. You're what? You're with this creep now.
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!
I...
Do you believe in love?
Today is bath day.
Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.
Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
In every sense. If at all possible.
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
What?
Oh Jesus.
Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.
Shut up. I'm not listening.
No.
We'll pretend it never happened.
I wasn't saying anything.
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
Are you scared?
What happened between you and the blonde?
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
I'm sorry.
I don't want anyone to die.
What are you doing?
My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. I just copied her prescription. You don't need to pay anything... just take it. But if she gets worse, you give me a call. I wrote my number on the box.
I lied to you. It was wrong. But at the time... I didn't know what to do. Imagine you got an earful from folks about that gal I's carryin'...
He black alright, he just ain't blue.
Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.
Mind I ask, what's all this business here?
This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it.
Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it.  These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school...
YOU HAD A PLAN! YOU HAD A GODDAMN LIFE! AND SHE JUST FUCKED THE GUTS OUT OF YOU!
Thought you had a skirt earlier.
This thing you got... I've heard people say, you'd fuck a tree if it was handy. I can see that.  But that nigger Tehronne. Thinks he's some player cuz he hustles dope and stolen hubcaps. I mean, I can see a tree. But that piece of shit?
Ronnie ship out this mornin'?
Rose. Folks get sick. But you do what you can to get on the mend. Our marriage... it just got sick. That's all.
Laz... You can't say nothin'...
God forgive you, for how you done me...
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
Let me say somethin' first...
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
You some kind'a pervert?
Now you get up! And you get in my house!
No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.
I said... STOP!
Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?
Want another?
My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it.
I don't want you to let go.
Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
There you go, preacher man. Get me drunk so I don't stick my foot up yo ass.
I skipped lunch.
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
You got any money?
What's this?
Some party.
... He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.
Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on.
Joyce can be nice.
Where're you going, Ichiro?
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
How'd you get this?
Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days.  He might not even be in Tokyo.
Yakuza.
Someone attacked him.
You all right?
I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood.
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
She's such a long way home for you.
This is my stop.
You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer.
Good.
We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.
Let's go while there is still time.
One man.  He must be good.
Would you like to be modified?
The facts of life.  I'll be blunt. To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence can't be revised once it's established.
But not to last.
Also you're too valuable to experiment with.
I like a man who stays put.  An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. You live here all by yourself, do you?
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
You could help us.
You're our best and only friend.
You got a machine on it yet?
The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.
Industrial refuse.
It's gotta be right for my customer.
Number three.
But I would like to buy you drink.
You like to kiss her goodbye.
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
During the road test...
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
Jeezus!
I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters.
I can imagine.
Don't just stand there looking at me.  It's not polite.
Where is he?
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
You know what I think?
Is this to be an empathy test?
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?
Already had I.Q. test this year -- but I don't think I never had a...
How come you were in my truck?
What's your name?
You want to go home?
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
You look... better.
Twenty.
My office.
Where are we going?
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
And that's it?
Thank-Q!
Very funny, smart ass.
Because I want to get married.
I don't want to be alone.
It does?
One who's not a mutant.
Never drive again!
I thought only hookers drank those things.
Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
The what?
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
I thought I was here to meet women.
Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
I don't blame you!
I know...and I'm really sorry.
What?
I know first aid!
Uh-huh. Adam?
How do I leave here?
I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man...
C'est bon, Monsieur.
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
Not particularly.
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
When did we get it from them?
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
This must be very new.
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
That's why little things mean so much to him.
Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.
Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
Bye, Troy!
Twenty-five? Around there.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
The sky?  Where?
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.
He drank it hot?
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
Really?
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
Home sweet home!
Oh, no.
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
Hi, honey!
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
In the generator room again?
We stay down here.
I want him to at least see the sky!
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
I see "elegant."
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
That water's freezing!
Um... Eve?
Go to the bathroom.
Where are you going?
What?
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
I don't think so.
I'm selling this place.  I want out of this hell hole!
Tower, say again!!
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
Frank. Come in.
Come into the study a minute.
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
Jeffrey?
Jeffrey! Come on in.
Okay?
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
You're all through with this now?
For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Not yet.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
Do you like talk like that?
Yes.
Do you like me?
Hi, can I come in?
No. But you're in very big trouble.
No. I should go.
Are you a bad boy?
You like to open me, don't you?
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Shut up.
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
I didn't mean to hurt you.
You what?
Dorothy. No!
I guess I should go.
Yeah, it's me.
They hurt his head.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. Straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet, straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
How is Central these days?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
I've gotta go in.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
Yeah, if it opens the door.
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
Brilliant.
Yeah, but.
I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
Okay, yeah, call.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
You saw a lot in one night.
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
Jeffrey!!
Everything okay?
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
Probably not. No. Why?
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?
There's ways around that.
Are ya ready?
Yes sir.
Look under the body.
Are these me considered armed and dangerous?
Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.
Anybody you think is evil?
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
What?
What are you saying?
What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview.
Yeah, well...
Look again for fuck sake!
How's Uncle Sibeal?
Still bickerin' over that, huh?
You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?
Well, we could try the bag over the head thing. Walk you right out the front.
We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here.
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?
I'm serious.
See. I told you there'd be a shaft.
Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him?
We do not want your tired and sick.
Yeah?
So, what do we do now?
No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go!
I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?
Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry, as I'm sure you've never been in one of these places before. A man goes into the booth, puts the money in the slot. The dancer gets it on the other side. She hits the button, door goes up, now there is only glass between you and it's  little fireman time.
These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?
That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up.
A couple of peons for the mob and...
This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?
Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop. This is the last time I'll see you. Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.
Hello?
No. You sure you're okay?
Liberating isn't it?
Worst day of my life, man.
Yes.
You're right.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
Forgive me father.
Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.
The funny man. Well, I got a new job for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having a real shitty day. I'm depressed. Tell me a funny story or a joke.
Well, it's the funny man. Give it here, package boy.
I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee.
What color hair does he have?
Why?
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
She's really kind of hot.
OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --
Inez, this is --
Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
See, now we've got a plan.
See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
That coward. Son of a bitch.
When'd he tell you?
Where was I?
He told you and you let him do it.
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
I had to give some to Inez.
Who's in the car?
Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.
I want you to look at this.
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?
Do you like Inez?
Who did that? What the fuck is that?
Who tripped the alarm?
Come on.
What are you talking about?
So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?
You mean a safecracker?
And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.
We're renegades from despair.
Absolutely.
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
Are you serious?
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
What are you doing?
We think Mr. Henry maybe --
Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?
What?  What?
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
You don't celebrate til it's over.
Well, what do you think?
The guy is fucking insane.
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
Where'd she go?
I think we might of scared her.
I'm going to take a look at this.
Did we get it?
That could be anybody's.
Bob, that makes no sense.
Not in that car you're not.
Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that.
It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
Come on!
That's OK.
How's that 700 bucks coming?
How you doing, Bob?
You keeping out of trouble?
And what does that cover?
What do you mean grammar?
The grammar?
No. Just pool.
How's the weather down there?
The world needs dreamers, son.
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
Treadstone.
Berlin!
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
Had to be done.
Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
Who else knows about this?
It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
You still should've moved.
What do you want?
Who sent you to Greece?
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
But we were so careful.
That's crazy.
You drive.
I wanted to kill him.
I know it's a dream.
Okay, Jason, your move.
Don't need it. I remember everything.
Looks like he's been detained.
Show me.
This is everything? Is there.
How long have you worked for the agency?
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
Is it fresh?
What do you think? Is he coming in?
Let's give him half an hour.
Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt.  He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but...
Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council.
May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin?
He won't come.
The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!
I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.
Keep these. We're going too.
I sent for him -- and the little coward send you?!
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
You've been here before?
Tonight then.
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
What does that mean for Evan?
Are you hurting her?
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.
This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.
Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.
I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off --
Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?
Not if you remember my dad.
Where... where are my clothes?
What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?
Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
Is something the matter?
I was?
What time is it?
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you, Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.
Smells like sex in here.
You knew the whole time, didn't you?  When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!
How long have you been married?
Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?
Hello, Rick.
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much.
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
-- It was "La Belle Aurore."
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
A franc for your thoughts.
Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
Yes, of course, we --
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
How did you get in?
I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
Ask me?
Rick? Who's he?
And I congratulate you.
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
I beg your pardon?
Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?
No. It's all arranged.
I understand.
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!
I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
I believe you have a message for him?
This is hardly the time or the place.
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?
Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.
How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.
Oh, but I just told you. --
I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
-- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
I have. Sit down over there.
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
I would advise you not to interfere.
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
No. Not me, boss.
It's bad.
No more water, you said.
No.
No.
You're putting off the inevitable.
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
What's so damn funny?
Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
He is a cute thing.
I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.
The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
You okay?
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
I used to drive one of those.  A long time ago.
It seemed like she had such a good time last time.
Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here...
What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?
You fucked us over.
I was making a point.
I'm from Arkansas.  Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention.
God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you!
This stinks really bad.
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
That's all there is.
That's what it's about.
It's not ergot, it's not pituitary extract, it's not oil of rue...
What are you going to tell the little ones?
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already.
How many months are you?
Where's Mandalay?
I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything.
So. Not bored yet?
Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?
But you looked as if you liked it.
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter...
I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me.
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
I don't know! He's just leaving--  you're the one who says he needs to see the world!  *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world!
But did you know him?
Did you know your mother better?
Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.
Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no *good* cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts...
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
But she's your *daughter*...
What business is you in, Homer?
Let me hear you say that! I so unhappy she runned away that I killed myself-- that what happen here, ain't that right?
I don't think so.
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
I don't need this--I know all about my condition.
I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me.
Uh... sure.
"One: Please don't smoke in bed."
Rose Rose?
You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself!
I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.
I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here!
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.
Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.
Where do you think you're going?
Can --
Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.
Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay?  Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?
What's this?
The Anti-Christ?
I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.
Keeping the Fix happy.
I can see why you liked her.
We were back on.
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
Not that I recall. What do you want us to do about it?
Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.
Fuck that. We're going too.
I'm going home
Moonan. Here. Shit...
That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this!
Shit.
You know what we're doing with the money.
When?
You'll be there?
Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?
What are you talking about? Ten's standard.
Of course. Jake. Nice to see you.
Oh Jesus!
We had to see what your deal was. I'm just a little superstitious.
Uh... Everything okay?
You told me to change my hair!
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
No, we never got busted. We were done with a shift one night, both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know? I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him.  What the hell was his name?
You got my cell. Leave a message.
It's bad luck.
Do we want insurance?  I'm just asking...
No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out from under all this. But we need another Shill.
Why?
Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson.
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?
Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.
Stand up.
What happened?
Aces, Suits.
So what do you want?
Hope so. Those fucking orthodontist bills are killing me. One fifty every time they tighten those bitches up. One fifty! It's not even covered.
I hate cheats.
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew.
How about fifteen hundred?
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
Three years, two months. March '93.
All right. As what?
I found her in bed with someone.
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
What are you doing here?  You know the rules.
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need, isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice...
For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion. 
So how are you doing, dad?
Yes, I know that.
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
I want you to forget what I said.
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
It's all relative.  I need the money too.
Yes.
That bruise has cleared up nicely.
Detective Inspector Ross.
Where to?
So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy.
Rough day?
What happened to Bella?
I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.
You want me to check?
Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture.
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
She's not in the gaming business is she?
Yeah.
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
Hey, Doolittle, here's one. An unstable planet. 85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star.
Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop. Just wondering if everything is all right. Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
Thanks.
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
Everything sounds fine, bomb. Dropping you off in sixty seconds. Good luck.
But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it.
Hey, bomb...
Hello, bomb, are you with me?
My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.
And you can only do it once, right?
Pinback...
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
What are you gonna name it?
Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.
Wha?
Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is.
Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
Man, you got a bad attitude.
Who's Camille?
Move it.
How're ya doin', Max.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
So Max, what do you do with all your money?
What a creep.
What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
You didn't...
Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think.  If she hears her kid's voice...
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
I was expecting someone else.
Sorry about your window.
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--
Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.
L-Triptophane...a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures.  Then the lightbulb went off.
We got separated right away.  I never knew how many made it.
These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder.  The oldest is twelve.  The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.
You are involved.  By being alive you're involved.
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
How do I know you're telling the truth?
And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...
You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
Who's this guy?  This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.
You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
Morning, Sunshine...
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
Tell me the truth.  Am I a female fog bank?
A little what?
Friends don't help other friends cheat.
Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
Who are you?
Make the call.
Probably a touch of what's going around.
I don't see how you cheating on Natalie involves me.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
A toy?
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
True, but--
Huh?
You love him?
What's that?
Whoa... she is a killer.
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario.
Namely?
Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk.
Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati.
Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
Cool, bro, now listen up...
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.
Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.
I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.
Wait! I know how we can get in!
Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.
Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
But, mom!
Grounded for the rest of the year?
Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?
I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me.
Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.
Trip, you fuckin' asshole.
I did it! I did it! We won!
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
Two hundred bucks?
I feel bad for his family.
You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night!
I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
Where are you going?
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...
They suspended me for two days.
Will you please talk to me?
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
You're such a fuck-ass.
He can't, Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?
I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.
Who is Frank?
What's "Cellar Door"?
I asked you about school.
What else do you think about during school?
What about your family, Donnie?
Yes. I went to jail.
I think now that he might...
I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
I can see him right now!
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
It's called "The Philosophy of Time Travel".
What's her name?
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
He was a year ahead of us?
I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.
Rose, we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.
What is this shit?
We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
I gotta work with these women.
Oh c'mon, I love 'em, but you know they only had me 'cause Peter needed a kidney.
Mrs. Leeman?
...Yah -- 1963. Her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in Louisville, her hometown. Those were different times.
Oh, Mom, it's so ugly.
Here, I didn't get any.
Are we on "Cops" again?
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
People, people -- wait, wait a minute, here. Uh, while we haven't ruled out sabotage from neighboring state pageants -- Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota...
The bitch.
And the year before that?
Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street?
...that filth is better left in the "Sin Cities."
It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.
Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
EE-AAAYEEEE-AAAAYOUIAAAEEEEEEEE!
Let's get this straight right now. We wouldn't have been late at all if it wasn't for you.
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
Dear Sir... enclosed find check for $100.  Yours very truly...  Send that immediately.
He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately.
Yes -- why?
What kind of a dog is he?
Half watch dog?
What do you whistle?
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
Hello...  Yes...  No, not yet... All right...  Goodbye.  That was for you again.  He wants you to call him up as soon as you get back.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story?
You're right about that guy -- I think we've got something.
Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
I wish you were still working for me, so I could ask you to resign. How're ya fixed for cavalry?
Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you.  I want to hang it in my bedroom.
This has gone far enough!  This interruption is humiliating, to say the least...
Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
You know I think they think I should be king.  Although it would please me to govern the throng, suppose I were king and then everything went wrong.
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!
So that's the one you want to marry.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
You sly bastard. You're doing this to spite me, aren't you!
What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!
Good morning, Treves.
Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you.
A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?
It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.
Can you imagine what his life has been like?
Has the response picked up?
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
Alas, no.
Tell me about it, please!
Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had.
John... Merrick
You look splendid, John.
John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
The children! May I see?
You want a dressing bag, John?
Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
Incredible, isn't it? Well, I think John has had enough visitors for one day, Mothershead. I've got a lecture at the college, I'll be back this evening.
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
What was she like?
We mustn't let him land!
Just give me a hand.
But you don't realize....
Blow the third note! The note to take us home!
Then I shall come too.
LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
Would you like us to sing to you?
Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.
I'll tell you what...
Have you done this sort of thing before?
What about the raping?
It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
What?
You can't have Sven's father sitting next to Sven. They'll argue the whole time.
What's the matter with them?
What are you talking about, Erik?
ROW!
You coming? You don't even believe in Asgaard.
Who's that?
Can't make enough axe-heads!
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
Wasn't it, Keitel?
Sh! Hurry!
You've lost your mind.
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
Well, of course he is!
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it.
Who was the girl you walked off with?
Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
You're sure? It's cold.
Where do you live?
Take care.
No. I --
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
Oh, thank God. It's going.
So, um --
More?
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.
Yeah?
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
I know.
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
Me too. There's this poem --
I do sort of live with somebody though.
Male or female?
C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.
I think I should go back.
Listen, did you want to make love?
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
Look, I have to go. I have to think.
I don't know. Panties and --
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...
So you're still on the Zoloft?
What?
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
Hi.
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.
Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!
Yup.
It's stopped.
Hey.
And after that?
You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.
Okay, we're back in.
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.
I tried that already.
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell in love with her last night.
Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.
You don't?
Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink.
That's Jellybean!
Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
No, I guess not.
Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.
I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.
For magazines?
Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...
The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.
But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?
I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
From what?
The containment, Second Containment...
It's holding... She's holding...!
It was like... nothing was there... and then Justin appeared and the Core... became metal...
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
We haven't tested the air yet. It could be contaminated...
How is he?
Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.
That ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. If the Titanic sailed into New York harbor, I'd find it more plausible.  Houston wants Aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. If it really is the Event Horizon, they'll attempt a salvage.  We need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew...
I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?
Hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion?"
It's 2041...
What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...
I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady.
Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit!
Now what?
Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.
BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
I'll do it --
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
There's no one in the corridor but us.
Hey...
The safety circuit's failed!
I didn't see anything and I don't have to see anything. This ship is fucked.
I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...
I'm not really dressed for a party.
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
What do you want, Vic?
What did you wish for, honey?
He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
How long was I out?
He's smart, powerful, successful --
We're working as hard as we can --
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
He's not responsive --
Now what is up with that?
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
Apparently I can disappear.
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
I'm driving.
Is that what you call it? "Real"?
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
How's the IPO?
Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this.
I mean, you broke up with me, right?
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you... speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
It's just business.
What are you doing?
How much did they cost?
Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again.
Something happened to them, mon.
Go ahead. Just make it quick.
On the ledge?
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
You're not going to tell me, are you?
Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?
Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball.
Dad says you have to get up!
I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.
Pick a suit.
Are you really a virgin?
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?
And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.
Yo.
Well, I've gotta be running.
You're losing it, Damone.
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
Merv, this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning.
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
My brother's car!
We just missed the turnoff to the party.
My brother is gonna shit.
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
He gave me his card.  'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
What do you think?
God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
Not coming? What happened?
You just ripped my card in two!
Do you want to sit there, Jeff?
What's that?
What do you do with the jackets people leave here?
What's your other question?
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
I don't know.
Where's Mike today?
What's the message? My light is blinking.
The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...
We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
If so -- well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs...
We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me.
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
Why?
When does this thing stop?
What tape?
The cops?
What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet Barbra...
This is a fucking nightmare.
What could they do? The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds. He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M-16s.
Like big lizards.
Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.
Sure. It's all on the Q.T., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line.
No, she's looking for you.
Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a politician.
May I see your license.
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
In that case, maybe she can help.
We should go! We should go right now!
Where are you two going?
Well, it don't look pretty.
We'll be food, dickheads!
What tunnel? Where?
You seem mighty collected about this.
Why do you take shit from him?
You wanna see, baby?
He's dead.
What's it for!?
Open?
I wouldn't do that, son.
Welcome back.
They were all over the place.
Clever fuckers.
Yeah, maybe.
Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.
Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
What's wrong?
DON'T!
Let's go!
Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming, baby! Don't move! Mommy's coming!
You know you don't have to do this.
Did we make it?
Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
What did we say about lying?
You know that no one likes a liar, right?
Come on, it's just what you need! Let everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!
Well... you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics.
Oh. I mean, good.
Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. You see, I view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and I can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can I?
...Not only an artist, but an instrument of change. We must look to the world around us, not content to observe, but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs. We will not stand idly by as Fascist bombs obliterate democracy. We contribute our profits, for if fascism is not stopped in Spain, it will spread across Europe, jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive.  The artist, to be vital, must be a soldier too.
Where's Clifford?
What does Clifford say?
Hey, where's the fire, sister?
We're all square now, Harry. Right?
Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it.
...Don't you?
No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.
Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry.
...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?
Were you a drug addict?
Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad.
I know that, Dad, but --
Bread?
I'm going back to the hotel.
But, Kurt, I...
Address?
Okay then...
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
How'd I look?
I kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, I would have been miserable living his life.
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
Frances...
You're telling me.
Harry? Harry, where are you?!
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.
I just wanted to be part of something... one thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine... memorable. And I could say: I did that, I made something good.
Oh my God, I look awful.
I don't think I'd be much good in a war...
I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
You know something, Harry?
What a man!
You give up on her?
Frances, You're crazy.
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
...Is that not true?
What happened? Who're you?
I live here.
'But how do I know you love me?'
Mama...
I'll have lunch ready by one.
Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath?
On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration --
I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.
Thanks are hardly necessary.
Normal. Average.
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
Symington says...
In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
What can I do?
Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
She's beautiful.
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
What kind of God is He to will this?
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
Our decision. Together.
No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.
They just caught the man who did it.
You can't. Death is God's will!
Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
Professor Waldman.
I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death itself.
You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
He's dead... She's dead... all dead... Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh my God, oh my God... oh God...
The killer is still out there.
Cabin B is ready.
That's got her. Thanks. I'm Steve Christy. Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes? Climb into 'em. Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse. I want him to start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?
You can only do what you can do.
It sounded like Brenda.
What's the matter with it?
I'll be along.
I wouldn't know.
Somebody's there, Barry.
Give me a hand?
No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What's to eat?
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
Don't call him.
Looks like a storm.
Mmmmmmmph?
Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
Cowboy.
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!
Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th. They keep statistics. We get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there's a full moon. It affects people. Makes 'em nuts.
Good luck.
What was that?
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
We got about two more hours of day light left. That'll get us into El Paso, which is right next to the border. We'll stop at a motel --
Have you forgotten about your sister?
You don't believe in suicide.
Why did they block the door again?
What's your name?
I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.
Didn't like it, did ya?
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
Who else?
Now, is your shit together?
You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!
I promise.
That happens, you'll get it back.
There's nothing wrong with this place.
You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four...
Not good enough, swear to God.
Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
Creepy guy.
You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?
See ya.
-- see this, television!
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
Jesus Christ man, that microwave food will kill ya as quick as a bullet. Those burritos are only fit for a hippie high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin' tanked tonight.
Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
Gotcha!
What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.
Do they have an X-rated channel?
Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?
Yes, Seth, I understand.
I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
They're gonna search the van.
What does that mean?
Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
My shit is together.
In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.
B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door.
But are there... I mean, how many...
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
Ah, c'mon...
Can't complain, ma'am.
It should.  You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me.
You don't know that.
Hey.  You okay, Flea?
Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.
Just do it, okay?
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
Just a coincidence?
Do we know it's him using the beacon?  Not a decoy?
That was good headwork, lieutenant.
By the way, I'll need that option paper by 11-hundred today so I can review it with Admiral Hanover.  And do we have any of that breakfast tea around here?
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway.
Made it to Week 10 last time.
At first.
She part of the training?
32 feet, six inches!
The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women --
That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured?  Didn't you even think about that?
Got it.
O'Neil...
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
Thought you two were file-closed.
Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But Pentagon's a big place.  Let's narrow the sights.
That's cuz I'm married to you.
You okay?
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
So you made it.
So, you still picking apart cockroaches?
If the military are listening, they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape.
What the hell are you doing?
Caiman, wait. Take me with you.
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
I'm sorry about all this.
When we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone.
Look, I may work for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but accidents and spills are not my field.
Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?
Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was injured and bled.
Are you looking for this?
How did you get all of this stuff into the country?
It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
Three eggs. I thought there would be more.
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
This is it?
Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-
I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
Okay, Quellek, let's get back to the command deck and-Suddenly we hear a PISTOL BLAST and Quellek's chest turns RED. Alexander and Quellek look down at the blood, horrified.
I'm glad you asked... To me the most important qualities of a Galaxy Explorer are loyalty...
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
"Purple skinned monstrosity...?"
Not again...
He wants to THINK!?
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
This is ludicrous.  Why are you listening to this man?  Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?...  He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow.  No offense.
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
Oh my god, It's real.
WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!
Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In "The Quasar Dilemma", the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-
Commander, as I was saying... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?
What does the Omega 13 do?
Go. They're off again.
What?  Up?
What's the weather like outside?
The enemy is matching velocity.
Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.
It's suicide.
Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don't KNOW it.
We're screwed... We're so screwed...
That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
More to the left... Stay parallel...
"Assault on Voltareck III."  Episode... 31 I think.
~e're alive!
What?
This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?...
Wait. When are you going to tell them?
Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!
There's nobody here. Jason...
All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly.
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
All right... here's the plan:  First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere.  Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter.
How does the rolling help, actually?
What?  What did he say?
Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
There's no hatch.  There's no hatch!
You gotta admit, they do love him.
We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  Teb, reset the pod, we're going back.
Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...
But what if Sarris survives?
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
Commander...
Mathesar? What is that?
Anything.
All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on.  Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time.
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?
Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
No uniforms.  No coats, even?  In this weather?
I'll expect you for dinner this evening, Captain Hamilton.  For Christ's sake, have a bath.
It's impossible to stop these men deserting in winter, you might as well stop geese from migrating.
What is this?
George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
Partially...
Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
General Lee is detained captain...
That damned Arnold is here, isn't he?  Did you know he lost all his ships?  Outrageous and completely unacceptable.
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
I feel the same, sir.
Surely you knew this was coming.
Well, a very real expectation is the British will hang you!  They'll burn Mount Vernon and they'll hang you!  Our marriage is a business just as surely as...
"Liberty, Virtue, Country"... That's from Cato... you know, that play about the noble Romans?  As I was riding up to Philadelphia, I found myself thinking about the old days...
Martha... what?
But, you do come from a military family?
They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  It's their nature.
Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform...
Well, the widow Curtis will bring you riches, position, land, even half-grown children.  You won't have to do anything at all!  You shan't have to do another thing to prove yourself.
They can use their imaginations.
And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer.
Listen, tonight, later on, I got one for you doesn't involve any heavy work. I want you to go have a look around Chili Palmer's hotel room.
Hell, why not just shoot her? Why not shoot everybody. Fuckin' shoot me. Shoot the fuckin' president?
You know, you speak very good English, Mr. Escobar.
What's this movie you're doing first?
Harry called you his associate, but what does that mean? I never heard your name or read it in Variety or The Reporter or anyplace.
Get something going there.
You know how to write one of these?
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
I'm working on a few things.
I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man?
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
Your wife a Lakers fan?
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
That's it? That's your movie?
I imagine in your line of work, there were times you had to get rough, you know, say one of your customers stopped paying.
You pack a gun?
What does that mean?
"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
What do you get out of this?
I had to tell 'em something.
You tell me you want these guys off your back. Next thing I know, you're saying yeah, maybe they can have a piece of Mr. Lovejoy. I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.
Is he giving you a check or cash?
Okay, Harry, I'm wrong. You're not the one he's setting up.
Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie.
You cut straight hair in this place, or just fags?
Yeah, he told me.
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
What's that?
How? By taking my money?
We call you a taxi.
How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
I got you a copy of the script.
I think it's not horrible.
How'd you meet Martin anyway?
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
You sure?
I don't know.
Were you scared up there?
They're closing the Granview. You know, theater down on Biscayne?
You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?
He already knew it.
That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.
But you are interested?
Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over.
North Island, please repeat? Over.
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Your radio check is affirmative. Over.
Fucker!
You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat.
One more?
Maureen.
Guess I'll just keep working.
Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. We gonna let this guy just take it from us? One guy?
Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You raised on a farm?
Yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over.
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
I think you know.
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.
Could be a fishing boat.
You mean, before she sank.
Coffee.
The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
You sure it wasn't me?
They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
The ah... the radio's out.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
Epps? You there?
What do we do with him?
So you killed them?
I don't give a damn about the gold.
The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka.
Yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka.
Maybe Epps's mystery man had something to do with it.
Say what?
What about the gold?
Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it.
Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending?
And what can you tell us about this... 
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
...wow...
Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!
What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!
Aren't there a million places like this?
Jesus, look at this guy.
Hi Josh.
I just stopped in to say hi.
Yeah, well --
How long have you been up?
God, what a bunch of retards...
These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class!
Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again.
Since when is she an "actress"?
Hi.
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
Jesus! Listen to this one: "Do you remember me? Airport shuttle, June 7th. You: striking redhead with yellow dress, pearl necklace, brown shoes. I was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens. Am I crazy, or did we have a moment?"
Does Oomie really like this show?
Hey - why do you have this?
Look at how cute I am!
Look, that's back when I hated you.
I want to do him!
What does it stand for?
Are you sure?
He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.
What should we do? What if he recognizes us?
What? How long have you been standing there?
Where are we going?
That guy is totally amazing.
That rules!
He gives me a total boner!
What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?!
Don't you want nice stuff?
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
Hello?
What happened to Seymour?
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
Why? What did he say?
When was this?
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
How much is this?
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
Hi... what's your name?
Wow!
I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
What about her? Would you go out with her?
But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!?
Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...
I promise I'll take good care of it.
I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away.
I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?
That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --
No, of course not.
Uh... sure... come in.
Where did you get this?
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
Yeah, sure. Of course.
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
Why would she be hiding from me?
There is no reason for fear.
He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.
Morning, friend, glorious day.
I wasn't and you know it and don't push it- just listen- we have a problem in Tsavo-
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
It hasn't been that simple so far.
And it worked?
I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
Many thanks.  You're Patterson, yes?  Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must have told you that.
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely indispensable- the only man here everyone trusts.
John? I know this isn't the time to ask, but-
We need to talk.
The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you ever led trackers?
Samuel says you killed a lion.
Oh yes, I think so. 
Why so many?
Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
So what happened to Mr. Right?  I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.
He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.
Good luck.
You're really good, you know.
Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.
They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
Does she know anything about babies?
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
That's not true.  It was 1620.
Sorry!
That's quite a story.
I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.
Then why have you come?
You pitiful, miserable creatures!  You dare to challenge the power of darkness?  Don't you realize what you are dealing with?  He's Vigo!  You are like the buzzing of flies to him.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
Your honor, may I approach the bench?
Can I have some of your water?
Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.
I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
Yes, I did.  We were city champs.
So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.
"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"
This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
No, not exactly a man of the people.  "Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy."
If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me, sucker.
I love this.  We're onto something really big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to make some headlines with this one.
You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
What happened?
You should've been there, Venkman. Absolutely incredible!
Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
And he didn't die of old age either.  He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
Is it a star?
Well, I guess some people have it and some don't.
... and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there.
You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
You really don't act like a scientist.
I want to help you.
He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
This is going to cost you, you know.  Our fees are ridiculously high.
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
Egon, there's something very strange about that man.  I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  I'm afraid you're going to die.
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
Heavens, no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
At ease, Officers.  I'm Peter Venkman.  I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can.
The man is a psychopath, Your Honor.
Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?
Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
I've got to sleep.
I don't know.  Talk to it.
Anything!  Just make contact.
If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.
They will.
How do you know?
Boy, that was a rough one.
I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?
Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?
You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.
No one in Rome has ever heard of him.  Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have?  The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with.  Forget about him.
Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
You and my father have become very close.  Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.
Endorse me in public.  Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates.  I know you would give anything to be outside again.  Endorse me and you will be free.  Think of it.  What would you do with your freedom?
So am I.
We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
You won an impossible fight.  You got the attention of the crowd, legate...
"Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens."  The Emperor's going to fight in the arena.  I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know.
It's time for you to tell the Citizens that Commodus stole the money allocated for defending the German border.  It's time to tell the citizens everything.  Will you write it?
I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.
It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.
Where are they?
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
The Senators admire you.
Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.
Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
Sorry but I have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise I won't even get back the cost of the bribe I had to pay the arena slaves to get you here.  I know what you're trying to do:  kill yourself and trust in the Roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands.  The only thing you have accomplishes is to prove you're a very important individual.  You make me feel good about my investment!  And that puking pig Jerses -- he won't even discuss you.  Both of you have clamped mouths!  But I love all my fighters -- I'll find out about your family.  And about you.  That I promise.
Proximo, if this is her doctor he's an assassin.
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
So, things change.  The government has moved to the circus.  You're going to fight last.  And Commodus is going to fight first.
Let's talk about this later.  Right now we have other things to settle. You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia.  From there, Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum.  It's beautiful; an old Greek town right on the ocean.  Rich soil.  Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements... although Caesar will give you a sort of pension it's always good to look to the future, keep your hand in the arena... so to speak.
You're living at home now. Is that right?
Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?
Benjamin --
Was she married or something?
Why aren't you ready?
No -- don't cry --
Yes.
Is it because I'm here?
Well, I want you to leave.
Why?
She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
What are you looking for?
What are you going to do now?
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
Why do you have to see him?
Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --
Oh.  Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street.
Are you listening?
One of those outside agitators.
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
Give me an hour.
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?
Is there an ashtray in here?
Is it a girl?
In general.
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
Thank you.
Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house.
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
What are you so scared of?
Hello, Benjamin.
I got a single room.
Would this be easier for you in the dark?
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
You're not interested in art?
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
Him?
What do you say to him?
We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
Right.
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
Why did you do that?
Well I can't.
I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
What was your major?
Well how did it happen?
I'm curious.
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
Mrs. Robinson --
Hello. Get me the police, please.
Ahh. I don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.
Can I talk to you a minute?
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
I drove -- I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I -- I drove her home.
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
You have yourself a few flings this summer. I bet you're quite a ladies' man.
Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
Now look -- please --
What's happening?
You are late -- the dancer's gone to the theatre.
Never?
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That? 
You were very different yesterday.
I'll do anything for you.
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
And then --?
Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
Why do you smile?
What can you see?
No?
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
Suzette will be back here any minute.
Why later?
Bless you...
I can't.
On the train?
Till then.
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
And this is Doctor Otternschlag.
What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least...
All right then.
That was my last.
Goodnight, Kringelein. 
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
Well -- last night was not so good.
My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
I think it would be much better if you went away.
So that's how we stand, Baron.
The night clerk has already gone -- you are late.
I don't know.
There is no pocketbook here... On the floor probably. 
I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes.
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
Dance then? 
You dance splendidly.
You loved the Baron, didn't you?
He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
Am I!
What...! --
Moreover...
No.
I understand you perfectly.
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
I'm going to keep an eye on that Kringelein fellow. I'll find out where he gets the money to hang around the Grand Hotel.
What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip?
Of course -- of course. 
You are late. I've been waiting for you -- waiting.
I'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.
Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance.  I think, Suzette, I have never been so tired in my life.  Veronal didn't even help me to sleep. 
Madam will dress now, it is late.
It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
Last night?... There was no applause.
Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
What is this insolence?
I know -- I know.
Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway.
Pretty as a picture.
How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?
Your what?
Motherhood.
Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.
Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already...
Come take a look. An entire-suite of main-frame computer.
I certainly hope not.
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
You are a valued customer, as you know.
All right.
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
Whadaya say?
Kaggs. Home office.
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
Good to have you back, Roy. I was just looking at --
Don't mention it.
I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.
What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what?
I like those.
Sure.
Lucky? You call that lucky?
I tripped over a chair.
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
I know what's bugging you, of course.
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was.
If I should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. That's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. If you try to do it your way, what future is in it?
That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...
Let me see how you did that one.
Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?
Look at me.
I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
The tap. What you do for a living.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark.
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
You -- I don't know.
The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. I've seen people like you before, baby. Double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. But you don't make it work forever.
Not many laughs in this room, eh?
That's that, then.
Well, thank you. And thank them.
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.
You take all your dates here. Blake?
Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
A dead body?
Think Eddie had something to do with it?
Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?
What the --
You some kind of fugitive or something?
Now you're joking, right?
Nah, I didn't tell her where I went.
You really think Eddie killed her?
Molly, of all the people... if I can't trust my resident assistant, then what?
The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
I have to pee.
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Let the party begin.
He do that to you?
Hold on, hot lips.  We got work to do.
Happy fuckin' Halloween.
Jesus, that's my neighbor.  Tommy.
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
Guess they -- went to the fair after all.
Shitheads ... Defacing my property.  I showed them ...
See what I'm talkin' about?
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I supposed to be looking for?
God, what's wrong with him?
Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
What now?!
We need you, Dr. Loomis.
What is that?
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
No!!!
Yes?
Home, sweet home.
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
Excuse me.
So, kid--how they hanging?  Or don't you say that to a little kid?
You never played a violin.
Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
What an awful sound!
It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa.
Fifty years?
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
Sir?
Man and boy.
College!
No.
Oh hell.
The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?
You're supposed to get hurt!
Why don't you go to bed--son.
Dad?
What's this?
Get mad!  Tell me you don't like the way I treat your mother!  Tell me you wish I'd never come home!
How do you do.  My name is Penelope Ryan.  This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.
Can I help you, sir?
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
You don't even know me.
How do you do?
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
We all are.
He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
Honeymoon!  Honeymoon!  Say it: Honeymoon!
You used to like it stark!
I have some change!
I should have torn that door off its hinges.  Should have scrogged her ears off.  Should have broken the bed.  What do you want?  Well?
What then?
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
Why not?
He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's a failing, I know.
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
How do I load?
Hello?  Oh--hello, Mother.
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
You wish the woman good luck, and you tell the man how fortunate he is.  That's how it goes.
How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.
Ah!  You're ambulatory!
There's a certain amount of information there.
What brought you back?
You're old--so old.
A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
You're in one hell of a jam.  You realize that?
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
I love you!  Have a cigar!
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
The new hero is you.
You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me.
What is this thing that kills me?
Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
I dunno, boy.
And you went home unannounced, too?
Alice got married again.
Alice is dead?
Won't you please join our club? Please?
Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation.  Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring.  He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace.  He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes.  He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did.  It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo." Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids.  Any little kids.
What's this?
I worship your father.  That stuffed alligator your mother gave me--the one he shot?  It's the proudest thing in my apartment.
That goes double for me.
I know.
A what kind of doctor?
What are his symptoms?
What does he say to do?
Really?
It came yesterday.  I haven't opened it yet.
Yes?
Is he coming home?
We've got to find him.  I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last.  And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home.  That's all he said--the thing about the key?
You were wonderful.
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.
The what?
I wish Paul luck.
Phooey.
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
If he'd just get into scouting, and camp out some, and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire--
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
Hello. My name is Beatrice. Have you been here before?
No. I don't think so.
I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities.
No.
I just want to ask some questions.
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
Well, actually I wanted to ask about this girl. I have her picture here.
We offer...
My name is Hope. This is Faith.  Charity's in back.
Is this all the display space we can get?
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
Are you the star of this picture?
The other girl is the star?
No.
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
No. I saw her with Tod.
Where is she?
Are you a private detective?
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
Up front?
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
You won't keep growing at this rate.
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you do?
Is that the way it was with you?
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, The Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of time. L is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go to Heaven.
I must have been in more motel rooms this week than in the rest of my life. At least it feels that way.
They are the same.
Grand Rapids? Of course.
Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about...
Mast?
In G.R.? Why?
I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is.
They're legal now.
What happened, pilgrim?
I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.
God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me.
Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
Who the fuck knows? The Four Aces. He goes there.
Fifty cents admission.
Do you have a, ah, film called 'Slave of Love?'
Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...
You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him?
What's that?
Ssh. I'm on a stakeout.
To his own daughter?
You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?
Hello, I'm Candy Gulf.
And what are you studying?
Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?
Haven't we met before?
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
Oh. It looks like a hearse.  Very nice. Compact.
How interesting.
Oh, of course. What is your name?
Yearse!
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
That's a nice teapot.
What happened?
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
What were you fighting for?
Okay?
Did Confucius say that?
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... You really want to hear about this?
With God?
Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl.
They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.
But they'll put me in jail.
Look at the stars.
Farewell?
Mother.
How do you do?
Harold?
Would you care to talk about this friend?
Let's examine the facts on it. I say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. I say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen. That's common knowledge.
And so I ask you - why the hell did we give up on the Germans? Those damn politicians in Washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national disgrace. Hell, look at history. The two best wars this country has fought were against the Jerries. Now I say, get the Krauts on the other side of the fence where they belong, and let's get back to the kind of enemy worth killing and the kind of war this whole country can support.
Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.
Will they really teach me to shoot?
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Parasite!
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?
It's different for us.
You knew?
He... he loved me.
Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!
It's a beautiful dress...
She's done it.
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
I... remember.
The past, the future, whatever this object holds.
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed.  Whatcha havin'? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out --
You were burned by some organic acid.
Red. How long was it latched onto you?
hound of resurrection --
harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
It's got a big stone -- in its hand --
A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
Don't look! Turn around.
And as a father, I worry about him.  In medieval stories, Agent Myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart...
I don't want him.
Sir, may I go first??
No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?
We've installed a very handy timer. Set it, walk away. Cable pulls the safety pins, K-boom! Easy to clean, easy to use...
You'd better stay here. I'll find a way out. We'll come back for you.
Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you.
Myers??? How's your arm?
Myers?
You want me to hold him down?
Where do you --
Myers, you're a talker. What's a good word -- a solid word for "need" --
Goodnight, then.
Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...
Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.
Just take it slowly.
Want to buy a bed?
Oh.
This isn't for real.
Let me alone, will you?
Suppose he HAD slipped us. What significance has that?
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
No.
I'm brother Frank.
Julia.
Back from where?
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.
It smells damp.
Well?
Are you all right?
Maybe a brandy.
Drinking alone.
What's going on?
Oh Christ.
I'll get the doctor.
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
Well I want you to see the house.
Great.
...maybe we should never have come back.
I guess.
It's like she's waiting for something.
No you don't.
Where are you going?
We're on the Cointreau.
You're not going?
Not that late.
Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that?  None, no chance.  That's just fate.
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
We'll do it next Monday.
What did you tell her about the shop for?
We can take your car.
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.
Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.
Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile."
Oh.  Okay.
Right.  So.  You must have an enormous record collection.
Is that it?
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
Rob.
Well we rang $900 today.
Yeah.
I dunno.
You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever.
Is it better?
Never?
Is that why you wanted to see me?
I called and called but you were out.  I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
Sure they are.
Me?
Look, are you coming or not?
Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
I can see why you say that.  Look, I'm sorry.  I really am.  The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared.  I just wanted you to know, that's all.
C'mon.  I want to know.
What it was like.
How?  How were we the same people?
Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
But what?
More confident, maybe.
Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
Just local, of course.
No.  Probably not.
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
Very persuasive.
No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
So?
About what?
What's happenin'.
I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
Don't you like that?
Hi, Marie.
It's a great song.
The Conformist.
For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
Hello?  Anybody there?
How old is Richard?
He'd want to know about all this.
Didn't look like it came from "Toys-Are-Us", that's why I called you.
You're the expert.
Would you like more tea?
-Okay okay.
Taupin, Richard Marshall.  Born March 16, 1945 in Church Hill, Maryland.  Received first driver permit 1967 in Philadelphia.
Jesus Christ.
Who is he?
What will you do now?
No.  I had to talk to you.
Is this what you killed them with?
Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
When you finish, what then?
There was a man once.  Just a simple woodcarver.  But he understood.  More than anyone he could see to the heart of it.  It never ends.  Today is the same as the first.  Tomorrow will be the same as today.  So much time.  And all of it wasted.  You love history?
The estate stuff is pretty straight forward.  Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat.
No.  So what now?  We just wait?
I must be insane.  Leaving work, ditching cops.  All to follow a murderer.  A very old murderer, but a murderer just the same.
Who are you?
Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.
Don't.
What is it?
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
What are you going to tell them?  That you're protecting a man who's killed four people?
Good way to lose your job.
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
Afternoon.
Aye.
I was driven out.
When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.
He told me there could be only one.
Then they were right.  I am evil. This is God's punishment.
Why does he want to kill me?
But we cannot be killed.
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
It will take less effort as you learn.
It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.
If you send me away now, Mara, I'll not come looking for you.
Equals?
Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke.
My father taught me.
The last four.
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
I'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his "heretic stronghold" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich.
Had a great swing with his blade. For a Pope.
He found us even there.
No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
Tradition.
We have some unfinished business.
Do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh- borhood at night?
Do you know what this is?
It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope.
Oh, it isn't like that.
Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?
About twenty-five hundred dollars.
But --
Hildy!
Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, here's your wallet. I got it back.
You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
Mother? But your mother --
Well, I'm independent, too.
Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.
Well, she'll know some day.
Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again.
Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?
Ts! Ts! Ts!
No? Well --  Johnson, you're under arrest.  You, too, Burns.
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, eh?
What's this?
Does it? You forget the power that always watches over the Morning Post.
No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now.
A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
You can break it, can't you?
Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to.  How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day.
Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --
I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.
What do you think I am -- a crook?
Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.
Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!
It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.
Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!
Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello?  I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em!  Duffy!  Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation!  Duffy!!
Lafayette two-one-hundred.
No!
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
Hildy!
It'll be Heaven!
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
Sure, boss.
Here's that certified check, Walter.  I drew out my wife's savings, and if this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined man!
How much?
Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know.
That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk.
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
Did you actually give Williams that gun?
I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.
Who is this man?
Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm retired. I'm one of you fellas now -- a newspaper man.
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
Any news?
Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
Okay.  Forget it. 
Hildy, I thought you were gone --
Mother!
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
You're not going to phone anybody where I am.
Don't talk too loud.
How'd you get here, Earl?
What's that?
Hey --
How much do you make a week?
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
For heaven's sake, why not?
You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has to do.
They wouldn't take it.
If you ask us, no. If you ask the state alienists, the answer is yes.
What's your hurry?
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
Want to know why they're called Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity?
You want to join our gang?
Do you know any swear words?
Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
You couldn't.
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
But Dad, It's the News.
You said that last year, Dad.
Wow!
What is it?
Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold.
Except the servicemen.
Don't panic!  Keep your head!
We don't know anything about it
Tiny's home.
Take his gag out, it's more fun with the screaming.
OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.
Christ, you scared the shit out of me.
Thank you.
Hey, great they're back.
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes.
The Duke?
But if you did.
Hold on, I've heard this before... but I can't remember the end.
Holy crap. You gotta see this place. It's awesome.
She looks like she stinks.
What was that?
Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but this is ridiculous.
Fine. I'll go straight.
What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?
I... I got back a stack today. Some nice shots.  See, a good topless June Wilkinson... unfortunately she personalized it...  to Stucky, love June.
Christ, ain't they all. All them retards wanna do is fuck and eat.
Goddamn.
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
That was good babe, just keep doing that.
Don't even say it.
What was that?
What'd we here, Georgie?
God damn.
Open up the trunk.
Bye sweety, we could of been great together.
Just back up.
I'll go. It's my fault.
God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.
That stupid hillbilly slut.
I know you're my guests and welcome but I'd please advise you to keep from cussing while in my house, thank you.
Fuck you, you fucking freak!
Well hello, officer.
I don't know. I only saw one.
What should I do?
Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?
What about the body you found?
Her part in this I can't figure... but I will.
Boss, the way I see it is these kids probally stop off somewhere, bought a bunch of booze and are off getting shitfaced.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
Wydell.
Tell him, Harold.
It's not so bad.  So, it just keeps growing?
You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
Is everything fine?
Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye.  What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do?
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
You what?
No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.
So?
My brother says he likes you, too.
No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking "do not disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob?
Rose, please go away.
Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.
I like you so much, with or without hair.  But don't spread that around. Bad for business.
As do I.
Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.
Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.
It looks wonderful.
I'm sorry about my parents.
Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?
Oh, and the sun block?
I don't know. Something.
Come on.
Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality.
What are you doing in there?
Who is it?
How's work?
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Puff, why don't you say a few words to the assemblage.
And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support.
Ugnh.
Unn.
Wait!
Mother?
It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I'm an ape like dad was...  And I have to go back into the woods now... forever.
Give me a bottle of beer.
It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
I'm ready.
What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?
Oh, wait a minute, Miss Packard.
Will you take a check, Bert?
Okay?
I'm buyin'.
I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?
You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
Sign up.
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
What's that supposed to mean?
Aren't you gonna go over and talk to him?
So does Eddie.
I wanna walk.
Well, here it's half.
Just tell me where I can find him, friend.
It's gonna cost ya money. It always does.
Why?
Whaddya mean?
Well... well, now.
Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
The pool game is over when Fats says it's over.
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Go to hell.
Hello, Charlie...  C'mon in...  That's my girl.
Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
I'll bet you do, Mr. Felson. I'll just bet you do.
You gentlemen care for a drink?
Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink?
Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
You better not miss, friend.
You quittin', friend?
Just a cup of black coffee, please...  Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute!  Would you, uh, like another cup?
Yours.
I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
So why go to college?
Eddie. The name is Eddie.
I could always get us a bottle.
Why did you do that?
Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
What did all this stuff cost you?
Oh, cut my finger.
Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.
Well, what's so funny?
A week? A year?
Oh, grow up.
And them fingers, them chubby fingers. And that stroke. It's like he's, uh, like he's playing a violin or something.
That's what the game's all about.
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
I came to play pool, Fats.
You -- think I am -- I'm --  -- an animal.
Yes.
You want to find them.
What choice did I have -- ?!
Will you keep feeding me?  How long can you live like that?  Until it kills you?  Until I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back.
That's who you are too, Emma.
It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
I know, son.  But you'll like it where we're going.  I'm getting a good job.  It's a pretty part of the country.
Wow.  There's the town.  And there's the air base.  This is a great hill.
A meteorite, Dad, look!
Which one's that?  The dull, red one.
I had an awful dream.
What did he talk to you about?
Jimmy, calm down!  What happened? Tell me what happened!
Where, Jimmy?
No one comes here after dark.
What is it?
Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed.
Ms. Magnuson, is Jimmy Gardner with you?
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.
David? How'd you get this number?
What do you want me to do?
Just my luck, no ice.
With you? I don't understand why you can't just show someone how to plant the virus, somebody trained for this kind of mission?
Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.
Can we expect the same kid of panic here as in Russia?
I don't know how you put up with him.
Did you try to switch to transponder channels?
Strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. The signal reduces itself every time it recycles. Eventually it will disappear. Are you listening?
What're you talking about?
What the hell is that?
Get us out of here!
We're loose!
Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
And our forces?
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
Where's it headed?
You scared the hell out of me.
Really? Ballet?
Jimmy, kick it! They're gaining.
Stevie... I can't...
He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?
Can they be killed?
Where do your people come from?  Where is your home?
Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
What has the old fool got himself into now?
Venice, Italy!
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
Where did this come from?
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."
Let me tell you another "bedtime story," Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.
You could be more right than you know.
Doctor Jones?
The Ark of the Covenant.
This.
What do you know about this place?
This one. I think he's in here.
I never expected to see you again.
But what are you doing here?
I'll never forgive myself --
No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.
You did!!
She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi?
How did you she was a Nazi?
This is intolerable!
My Diary's in Berlin.
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment.
Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
Well... I can't think of anything.
I didn't know you could fly a plane.
Dad, are we hit?!
Now, who are all these people?
Ready?
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
You're strangely dressed... for a knight.
I'm going after those horses.
All right! Where's my father
Captain Blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the "natives".
You're hanging on better here than you did in America.
The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive.
I believe we're being called to dinner.
Who?
He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".
I had a question, Mr. Prime Minister. I was examining some of the Maharajah's artifacts.
I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.
You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them.
Dr. Jones.
You got the tickets, Short Round?
What you look at, Indy?
Next time I flatten him! Did you see his eyes?
Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things...
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
You will find them when you find sivlalinga.
So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
What do you mean -- how?
What?!
Don't let it pull you deeper!
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai?
I think you should sleep closer.  I meant for safety.
Get -- the -- bug -- off!
Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!
Wait -- what're you doing?
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
I want to go home...
Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!
I get it!
I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!
I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!!
Who?
You're in my head...
No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play...  What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
Somebody's been here.
You'll be alive.
I'll tell you what to say.
Now what?
It can't take that long.
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
Sue them.
I don't like the sound of that.
Corridor A.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?
It's illegal.
Oh yeah, to what?
The beach?
Do you notice anything.
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
Now what?
Beautiful!
Touch her.
Without your pants.
What is it?
What did that cost?
Get close to them.
Just don't show fear.
He recognises you, throw him off.
Maybe she's telling the truth.
I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without you butting in.
You got any books in there?
You been had. We have.
Holy...
He aready made the deal..
She works for them.
Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
You just got a Mickey.
We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter?
I'm against it.
Can you fly this?
I knew you were trouble.
I knew he was following us. He diverted attention, exposed Ryuji's trap..
Me.
You've cut your hair?
We'll have to let them go.
What are you doing here, where've you been?
It is to me too.
And...you know Jan Gruner?
When you do...
Well...
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
You may you find all the solitude you want.
...Blake
I waited for you.
Who do you work for?
Trans Ocean Travel.
Why did you stay with me?
Why?
Why did they leave?
This business is over.
Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
And you?
This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
What?
Where what?
So do I.
Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
What happened?
Just like that?
I knew it. I told him.
Come on.
Must be a fulfilling occupation.
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
Wait.
It's alright.
It will.
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
Three hours.
When's your deadline?
Push it.
These are their leads, their sources. I want you to have your reporters...
Shit...
What are you cooking?
Yeah, I heard rumors.
Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?
You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Hey, Lowell.
How prominent? What kind of placement?
What do you need at the store?
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
No classes this morning?
What are you and Mike going to do?
Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?
Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do...
...I'd be lying to you if I did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion...
...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...
C'mon, it all worked out. You came out okay in the end...
Coffee?
Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?
And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage.  ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it.
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow. So, what about?
...okay.
Hello. You there
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
I told the truth!
That's the whole point, Jeffrey. That's the whole point. Anyone's. Everyone's. They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made. They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man. Don't you understand?
That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.
And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...
Poor communication skills.
"I would bet on it."
Hello.
And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
Is that a threat?
Honey, I don't think this is really relevant to...
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.
Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?
Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.
I have it.
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
-- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
Your husband told me you were beautiful, but I was unprepared.
How do you know?
I'll have the tournedos of beef. And the lady will have the same?  I assume you're a carnivore.
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
Hello?
Screw you, asswipe!
A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
Apparently she was very disappointed.
We're damaged goods.
Friends?
I have a surprise for you.
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.
Hello Marylin.
Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.
Hello, Rex.
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
Is this a lover?
Miles Massey.
Lilly's up.
Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
-- is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.
Wait. I know you.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
Ha Ha.
...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars...
What's Kirshner?
In anticipation of making you sick.
Wrigley?
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
I've put extra men on, all along the way.
Mr. Warne?
All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.
Here you are.  Do you mind if I ask you something frankly?  Do you love my daughter?
What's this about not eating?
Smart, aren't you! So subtle.
South America!
You talk as if he were a gigolo—or something.
Please don't shout.
Ellie—
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
Who is he?
Well, if it's as serious as all that—we'll move heaven and earth to—
Well!
Fine man to fall in love with.
Yes, I guess I have.  I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous.  Besides, what difference does it make?  I'll never see Peter again.
I'll be going.  Ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as King enters.
Why should she? After all—
It's my daughter! Go after her.
Why; naturally, I—
What would you like to have me do?
We've done that already.
Never mind, son. She doesn't want it. 
No.
That's a long story, my friend. You see, I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants.
It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah?
That storm sure made a mess outa these roads.
I beg your pardon!
What happened?
I don't want it reported!
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. 
Hey, Brat—!  The VIEW moves to the rear door of the bus. Ellie stands on the bottom step.
Do you mind joining the Israelites?
Who are you?
You've got a name, haven't you?
Here—
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
You'll find the showers—and things—right back of the second cottage. 
Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. I—I did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
Oh, so now I was drunk!
I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
This isn't "piggy-back."
Not a one.
What's got into you?
Here. Eat your head off.
You think it's simple, huh?
What happened?
Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
ONE—TWO—THREE—FOUR—FIVE
—six—seven—eight—nine—
How are you, Ellie?  Are you happy?
But I don't go in for that kinda stuff—much. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me. 
Sorry—I didn't mean to—
The dame's too smart for him.
Any of your passengers want a place to sleep—there's an auto camp up yonder a piece.
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
Joe, listen—
What's the thousand bucks for?
What!
Huh?
Who's she gonna marry?
I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute.  I'm in love with her, Joe.
All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York. The bag's worth twenty-five dollars.
What?
Wife?
I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?
Yeah—the "big boy"—the Boss of the outfit.
Yeah ?—How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
William Walter, the night clerk on duty here in the FBI office, gave me a copy of this.  It went all over the country.  Nothing was done, and the motorcade went ahead on schedule - and this wasn't even mentioned in the Warren Report!  Read it, Al.
Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on.  You're a goddamn spy.
Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
I'm lost, boss.  What are we saying here?
Can you get some sworn statements?
I don't buy it, chief - why would the FBI cover it up?  You're talking the whole FBI here.  A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country?
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
...Oswald?
...and have you ever met David Ferrie?
You know damn well who it is.
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?
What do you mean?
What about the mob, Dave?  How do they figure in this?
Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?
Leon's in a bad mood, don't get excited, he's all right.
And Shaw?
What about Ruby?
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
Dad, look what I drew.
I'm scared.
I want the truth.
I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams.  It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.
I wouldn't imagine where.
No.  Never heard of him.
No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
After dinner you paid him to have sex with you.
Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy, that this company was a creature of the CIA for the transfer of funds in Italy for illegal political-espionage activities.  It says that this company was expelled from Italy for those activities.
Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.
Jim, come on, honey, get down on your hands and knees and hunt for Jasper's Easter egg.
I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay Shaw is important.  I'm sorry.
We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim.
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
I know David - a strange character.
Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?
...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?
I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is?
Chief, I've had my doubts about Bill for a long time.  He's fighting everything.
Sad thing is the way it's screwing up this country, all these hippies running around on drugs, the way young people look you can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.  I saw a girl the other day, she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly, and you know what she painted on it? "Love Child."  It's fuckin' outa control.  Values've gone to hell, Jim... Course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat Johnson in the White House.
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
There have been a number of reports in reputable news media - Time, Newsweek, our own NBC - that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury.  What is your response?
Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say. 
Welcome, Mr. Miller.  Jim Garrison. Would you care for some coffee?
I'm glad you could find time to see me.  I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.
I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
You see, it works like this. You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out. That's my job. And I don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
What?
What's she want?
The envelope contains currency... all the same denomination, one-hundred- dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.
But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
Thanks, but I have my own now.
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
Does something else worry you?
Fifteen thousand.
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
You think he's got a thing for you?
I have to stand behind all my active bonds, but I'm not writing any new ones.
Did you do it that night?
Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...
The feds. It's evidence.
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
Where's the rest of it?
Then you're out and you get nothing.
It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell.
I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail.
Wanna go?
Sure I can't twist your arm?
Oh, Miss Brown?
And what would this be, Sweet and Low?
We'll just be a minute.
Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
Then how do you know he sells guns?
Not yet.
Uh-huh.
We could, if I'm not in jail.
Yes. All those things are true.
What did you do after that?
I have no idea.
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
I'm waiting for the phone.
You think I'm kidding?
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
Well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?
What the hell you doin'?
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
I'm tellin' you, those cops been fuckin' wit your mind. They turn black against black, that's how they do.
Yeah?
The Cockatoo Inn.
You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. You think anybody followed you?
How the fuck they know that?
If you want.
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.
And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.
Want a hit?
Were you a disco guy?
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
Wanna fuck?
Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.
What are you doin'?
Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
Thanks, Baby.
Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?
I know you don't know. I said guess.
If this is about you fucked Melanie, I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool. I leave you alone with a bitch like Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that twenty minutes after I'm out the door. So say "thank you" and I'll tell you, "you're welcome."
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
I still don't understand why you keep her around.
You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. We're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about.  Hey, where's Melanie?
You shot her twice?
How long was she in there?
You know who I saw in the dress department?
You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying?
C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it -- start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you.
On his prior, he served nine months, and he's working on four years' probation.
Do you know what he's on probation for?
I can see that. Why?
Somebody already did.
Well, give it to me then.
In a way, yes.
This place stinks.
She still is. She doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened.
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
Who is it?
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.
Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too much of that shit. That shit robs you of your ambition.
Hello.  Hey, Jackie...  No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
Cherry Bail Bonds.
Get me out of here.
Dream on!
You want to see me? Well, here I am.
By who? Why? Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.
Something weird is going on here. What is it about us? Even in Nam it was always weird. Are we all crazy or something?
Well, try, huh.
Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this.
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
There was a bang.
It's cold.
What'd he say that for? What made him say that? Strange, huh? Strange.
I know you. How come you're so tense today?
A bit.
She says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months.
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
I can't relax.
Louis, you're a life saver.
What are you doing?
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
She was good in bed, though.
Jacob, what can I do?
Gee, thanks a lot.
You up?
Did you look around the headboard?
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
Look at these, will ya? I don't believe it. Jesus, these are fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ... And here's my brother, when we were down in Florida.
What do you mean you can see?
She looked good then.
Jake!
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
I know.
It's just me.
I want to know. You tell me!
Don't!
How?
Bullshit!
WHO ARE YOU?
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
Why won't you answer me?
Jake, what is it?
Where's West? New Jersey?
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
WHO ARE YOU?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
You come here often?
What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too.  This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be.
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
Sorry. Sometimes I think I'm just gonna jump outta my skin. They're just drivin' me wild.
A car accident.
Do you want me to get someone?
Is he all right?
Watch it punk, I'm armed.
He's not part of the program.
When the left hull goes, so will the right.
Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.
Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
Uh-oh.
Where the hell were you?!!
Creepy.
Shit!
Kay-Em!
As long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance.
Done!
Goodbye, my love.
Then what do we do?!
What the hell are you doing?
Wait a minute...I need...
Sergeant!
He's dead. They're both dead. You don't understand what is on this ship. This is a being that kills. That's what he does. That's all he does. And he is very good at it.
We need weapons.
Where is everybody? What happened?
Give me a break! What happened?
What if you miss?
Oh, shit. He's going to see us.
Now this is getting exciting.
You think it killed . . .  Yeah, I guess not.
You're quicker than usual.
What are you doing?
Barbie from hell...
I didn't say I was good at it.
Sorry, sorry.
Kay-em you okay?
The power's back up!
What good will that do?
More soldiers?
So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
Did you bring a check?
What's the point with hooks and Lines? --
Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.
Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one!
You want to go through those?  I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop. It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity. Pick out what you want to keep -- it's mostly your city clothes.
Why don't we have one more drink, you and I, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not.
Martin!  Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority?
Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that?
...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining.  -- did you notify the coast guard?
Well, if one man can catch a fish in 50 days, then I guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day -- beginner's luck.
...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence.
There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.
A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!
I'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! There are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply...
What's that, a ship?
And nobody else saw her in the water?
You from around here?
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
...So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath, and figuring out how to explain to Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat.
Look at him take it!
I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs --
And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
Don't tell me -- 'Death Before Dishonor.' 'Mother.' 'Semper Fi.' Uhhh... 'Don't Tread on Me.' C'mon -- what?
That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!
Hey Bleek.
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
Wait, let me take that.
What, you mean as friends?
Hey man.
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
No.
Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.
Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.
I rock a Harmony.
Well, it can really only go two ways.
We definitely want it to have junk.
This is even better than Suspiria. You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark.
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
Hello?
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
Oh, okay. Like this.
No.
A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.
Then what's going on?
Hi. I'm here for the big show?
Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds.
Hi Dad.
Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
Aha! You love him.
What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four.
The Penny Saver sucks.
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.
Juno, what's the matter?
What?
...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
...Pardon?
Are you takin' the pictures?
Is it hard to learn?
You dropped this.
Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact.
Yeah but, what is it?
...thank you.
...I don't know.
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
...Mind if I hold that Bible?
Brian.
Can't hurt.
Yeah?
...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.
I thought you wanted to be a writer.
...and I think I know why.
Carrie.
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
Carrie... stop it.
Nervous?
Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking insane.
...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day...
You be at this personnel office, Friday, three o'clock sharp.
What happened?
You know what else?
And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby.
I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit.
Shit.
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water.
And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.
But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.
I wanna fuck Darcy.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
That.
Yeah. Why you give money.
Shut up.
So really, it's good luck.
Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.
Yo, you got any weed around here?
Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.
Hurry up man. Let's be out. I wanna go swimmin'.
I'm goin'. You on the list?
What?
Yeah. After I saw you last week.
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.
Why?
Because your a virgin?
How old are you?
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
Jennie. You've tested positive for the HIV infection.
You still mad at him?
You are being ripped open.
Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it.
Yeah. Have you seen Telly around?
I'll ask you one last time. Do you have diss digg?
I was like yes! I'm going out with him!
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative.
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
I hate 'em.
So that's why Casper is how he is.
Where does everyone sleep?
Slow.
I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.
That's crazy!  Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
All you gotta do is look at the map.
Of course it was.  Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering.  That's a felony.
What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
You got it on the board.
You're a lying bastard!
You set yourself up tonight when you attacked Kathy, you crazy fuck!
You want me to what?
What are you talking about?
You still having a problem with this?
You alright?
What is it?
Ready for round two?
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
And -- what path is that?
You'll find her.
How?
Have you any idea what the message is?
Hello.
Emotional?  I expected more from you.
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
Would you mind keeping your voice down? I have guests.
I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
They asked who would be best suited for this and you--
Who told you that?
Don't you have something you want to say to David?
How long has she been dead?
Only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to Sanderson for some case you're working on.  What'd he do?
Yes.  Why disguise your voice if no one knows it?
I don't think it matters.  Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.
His home would be... Mount Olympus.
Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
Maybe we should back up a minute and take a look at what we do have.  All the girls that have been killed have been killed at night.  They're all the same type.  All moved into their homes within the last three months -- and all of them found their homes through Homesearchers.
As large as castles.
What time did he get there?
He's right, Kathy.
I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
That's it?
Another one?  What word did he leave?
It's a commercial area.  No one lives there.
Where were you last night?
Alright, c'mon Peter.  We're moving you to a cell.
What do you see here?
Feel like practicing?
Bainbridge Books.
Are you one of the players?
That's a very personal question.
You.
Well, I think I've had enough.
They couldn't break the riddle.
It wasn't intentional.
What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
Alright.  What about me?
It was.
What?
Fine.
Nothing.
Peter...
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
That's still no excuse.  You treat everything like a game.
Why?
This letter.  I've never opened it.
How did you know it was "carefully"?
Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
We're almost married.
I will find you. I will be with you.
This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.
Your powers are greater than you know.  Have you ever seen one of these?
There is no other way.
But it opens onto the sheer wall of the Needle. There's no way down.
I am too old to climb down a rope.
I can't reach her.
Lyssa? <u>Why</u>?
Never.
From here, I must go alone.
She can see the Beast!
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
Do not let the waters touch you.
It is today?
Am I not worth returning to?
Not yet, my friend. It's your tomato that's dying.
They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them.
We could reach it on fire-mares.
You're resourceful, my lad.  I tell you, one year under my tutelage and I could make you the Prince of Thieves.
What is that awful looking place?
Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
Put me down, you lout!
And do you think I live on air?
I am being exploited! Where are you going?
What news from our friends?
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
Can you see?
I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.
She has the power of vision.
We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
But you would not stay with me.
You see?
Knowledge.
There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.
You will come with me.
Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
Why can't I have a bank account?
OK, I'm fine.
Wow! It's brilliant!
Not taken.
Stop. Everyone is looking.
Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, I make you notice.
Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!
Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
...Don't you drink?
You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
What do you do, with the money you earn?
I don't know... Five minutes.
How shall we get out now, Leon?
You say it just to calm me!
...Yes?
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
And your store?  What about your new store?  What about all your dreams?
Listen to me very carefully, because I don't want you to misunderstand me... The walk is over Uncle Maurice.  Done. Finished.  You've made it to California, it was a miracle, now let's try to save your life.
I have to finish first.
A.P.B.... He isn't breaking any law.  He's a grown man... He can crawl on his hands and knees to China if that's what he wants to do.
We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
Look, I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently.  If I get any information, I'll call you.
Are you a preacher?
A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife?  Crushed her like a bug.  Snapped her bones?
So what's the deal Maurice?
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
I've seen it before.
Yes?
It's a special day isn't it?
What it is -- is the truth.
A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing.
I do love you... very, very much.
... People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway.  I don't want us to be that way Ellen.
It isn't going to make it Ellen. Let the poor thing go quietly.
That's okay -- really it is.
I don't know.
If I die, you'll know where to look for me?
That's a reasonable assumption.
Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot.
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
This story is big huh?
Umm, he's going to make it isn't he?
What happened?
Where?
When are you leaving?
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
I'm really lost.  What does this have to do with walking?
Tom Joad?
There are a lot of people worried about you.
You look so happy -- how long have you been married?
Where did he go?
Orange soda?
I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.
Let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in Las Vegas?
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
How long have I been here?
Hi!
Why?
You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.
Your color.
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
Where are you staying?
Please don't raise your voice. I won't bother you about it again.
I'm pleased with you, Sera... how you have moved up in the world. I showed you a glamorous world when I took you off the streets...  and how you repay me.
It is, after all, Sera, my money.
Don't hit me.
Yes? What?
Were you with another man?
What?
I'm not having an affair with Enrique -- you know a Delta Gamma would never sleep with a man who wears a thong! I just liked watching him bend over to clean the filter --
What's going on?
Did you hear a shot fired?
Sit down.
I do. I'm not allowing it.
So she was distraught that her husband was dead?
Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?
Yes?
-- his life?
Is she?
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
Uh -- family.
I'm her sister.
Too demure?
What if -- you know -- it's not the night?
Picking out my wedding dress!
Speaking of which, can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K- Mart.
But maybe it's not what you think.
She's not!
I can't.
You really think I'm attractive?
Oh, he is so over on this campus.
Calvin Klein's spring line is atrocious. Don't you agree?
What?
His twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy.
You're beautiful.
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
You got into Harvard Law?
You look -- nice.
If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself.
Pink ones.
It made me realize something. I'm an idiot.
In court. On opposing sides.
She's naked.
Why?!
My generosity is not so large as that.
And you... are you not also afraid?
Then why hide behind a mask?  You are ashamed!
Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
We'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... I imagine you'll enjoy a good meal?
A few day's nourishment will see your strength returning.
Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
Now I want to live forever.  I've never felt so strong or happy.
To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
You come stealee tleasoo?
Friend Ogg.  Excuse our enthusiasm, occasioned as it was by a fondness for you.
So, Jack... think you be a Green Man and not know Gump.
I meant no disrespect.
It's bluebells!
Don't you know?
Here now.  Toss her this when you've the chance.  Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass.  She's terribly vain.  Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle.
Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.
There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.
What is it?
Damn them!
Don't see why I can't ride, too! I'm second in command, damn it!
This is ogre's magic.
Worse than the battlefield.
I should hope not!
God's blessing.
Is she... dead?
Wait, Jack.
That be so, better you pinch yourself now, Jack.
Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory?
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
She's sore hurt, Jack, tis true, but not dead yet.
Seems to be some sort of vaulted chamber up ahead...
A good day for singing...
She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did.
You see!  You see!
Well done, lad.
Sweet slippers of Oisin!
Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored.
These for me?
It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport.
Let's rest a minute.  I'm so thirsty.
I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.
What?
Sweet Jack.  I'm so sorry you found me asleep.  Don't know what came over me.
Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...
I can't see a thing.
Not very precise directions.
Never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday.
In every way.
Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird...
Simple as that, eh?
Can you show us the way?
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
You can go back to bed...or Lois might let you go swimming.
I woke up this morning at three and couldn't fall back asleep.  Everyday I think I see more of Sam than I've seen in years.
And video games after!
Why?  What do you mean?
Atonement.
Are you his friend?
Why?
My keys.
I had them in my pocket.
They're trying to make me spend the summer here.  I'm leaving in the morning.
I don't know.
Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie?
Not really.
Hey, I can get you three hundred cash for two hours.
Why is that?
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
I'm good, thanks.
This isn't me.  We can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer.  But you won't change.
Forty.
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
Well, it's the least I can do.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
What are you doing?!
You'll have money when you work.
Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
Where is it?
I'm not even listening.
Do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
I wish you had told me then.
I gave up on you.
Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
I would have lied to me if I thought I'd believe it.
What would you do?
Can you build a house in four months?
I aimed high.
God, you look like crap, George.
I didn't think you'd know I went missing.
Kurt's been feeding him.
I need to talk to you.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
One of you would end up dead.
George --
I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  That I'm happy today.
Finished or unfinished?
Where's Sam?
It's been a while.
Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
I thought we were helping.
Nothing is going on with us, is it?
When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
Is your back still killing you?
Peter left me yesterday.
Back.  Neck.  Back.
Are you going to kiss me?
Been thinking?
I wasn't sure.
What are you doing in my room?
You're sure about this?
Nothing R, okay?
They ain't men, Mae Rose. They're convicts. And nigger convicts to boot. Can you say nigger?
She's doing just fine.
Biscuit, when you're done with Jangle Leg, you think you could squeeze me in?
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
Sharp.
Forty years. That's a long time for any crime, even murder.
Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
I got it... boss.
For the kind of money they charge here, you'd think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes.
Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too.
I've never seen you in here before.
Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
My daddy gave me this watch.
My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.
Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude.
Alright. You want some pie?
Nice meeting you? You've been here before, haven't you?
Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
You lost all our money in a card game?
What ain't there?
I wouldn't do that if I was you.
You still got that map?
Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.
What'd you say?
You drew this?!
I know people.
You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
Well, if that's the way it is...
I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.
Don't make me take them away from you.
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
I know you're not talking to me...
You ever done time before?
Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!
Too hot, huh? Well, you tell that lazy jiggaboo the state of Mississippi ain't interested in his meteorological assessments.
We lost yesterday on accounta the rain. That means we gotta make up for it today, so put your backs to it.
1932? That's like, that's like...
I can't take that, mama.
They gave me life, mama.
If you don't mind my saying, you seem mighty familiar with your house boy.
What's your name?
Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.
What's the Boom Boom Room?
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with.
Now will you get in the flask?
Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.
I'll call her later.
Did you just talk?
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!
Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
Check one-two. Check one-two.
I mean... tough break.
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
This is bad, Nicky.
I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
Hey.
Thanks.
Easy, Liberace.
This don't look good.
So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
Please. You got to.
Hello.
You got the wrong window again, man.
Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him, not sure why.
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
What were you thinking coming here?
You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
How do you want us?
Why?
I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was?
Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
That was a great shot you made.
I just might look in on New You 483 myself.
What the hell took you so long?
Of course.
That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!
I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?
I'm not armed.  Well?
You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to --
Of course.
Why show me?
Why tell me?
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
What're you going to do?
I wish I could help you.
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
What do you suppose this was...?
What does that water do?
What kind of jewel is this?
We'll have to bury him.
Of course... that's settled then. But just you remember your promise...
Are there any other humans?
They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
I know...  We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it.
I'm, okay... You okay?
You recognize that guy?
Sure.
He'll kill us.
So, should I call Andy?
I'll set it up for tomorrow night. You'll meet me at his place at eleven o'clock... Don't drive there... Take a bus... Make sure no one follows you... His address is easy to remember... It's 2224 Deep Dell Place... It's a white stucco job on the south side of the street... I'll be upstairs with Andy... The back door will be open... That leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there's a bar there... At eleven fifteen, I'll ask Andy to fix me a drink... When he does, you can crack him in the head... Okay?
You all right?
Where's the bathroom?
Hey.
You don't look so good.
The police called us.
Never saw him before in my life.
We saw you that night, Pete.
Who is it?
I wouldn't know how.
When he went to work, right.
Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
We know that.
Who is it?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
There's no other bedroom?
Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning.
At your house. Don't you remember?
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
Where's Alice?
Don't you want to watch it?
So?
I'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
Beautiful! Smooth as shit from a duck's ass. Let's take a ride.
I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today?
Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?...
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
You want some company?
No... I told you.
Sheila... Stop...
Where's the girl? Miss Stone.
What about those men we met this morning?
Two years!?
Yes, it just shows—  I don't know why I'm talking to you. I don't know you. Who are you?
Good morning, Lovey.
Look here—
Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.
He might have lost his way.
And say, honey, you look a million per cent better. Wholesome, kind of - and clean. You take a tip from me, and don't you ever put that stuff on your face again. Why, it's like hiding behind a mask.
The police?
There you are!
Charming chap.
Chalmers Bryant!
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them?
When was all this?
Well, they didn't actually mean that.
108 and still active?
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
I surprise you? Now that's news.
Charming, isn't she?
Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
What do you want?
Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason.
Oh, immediately.
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.
Sit here, near me. I am an old man and can do no one any harm.
You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago—  —you're still alive, Father Perrault!
The power house - they've blown it up! The planes can't land without lights.
Hurray!
George, what are you going to do?
Let me up! Let me up!
Something grand and beautiful, George. Something I've been searching for all my life. The answer to the confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime. I've found it, George, and I can't leave it. You mustn't either.
I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
I knew there was a reason I hated this place. I'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you. How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth certificates?  I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world. And you, Bob Conway - two-feet-on- the-ground Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.
Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.
Where did you come from?
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
Was this your idea?
Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
You'll wait till you rot!
Thank you.
We have one motto: Peace on Earth.
You do?
Kay, listen, I dunno what got into--
We'll take it from here.
Pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! Take the van and go.
So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?
What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
What?
Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
Great.  Fine.  Listen, why don't we call the pentagon, maybe they'll take you back with the new age well wishers.  I'll stay here and go extinct with the dinosaurs.
What are you doing?
Wow... this one's cool.  And it looks just like a shotgun.
Do IT!  SHOOT HIM!
After I got the shit beat out of me!
Or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare.  I really like that.  Let the other girls have the guys like you. Chiseled jaw, perfect nose, quirky dimples.  I find you all so boring.
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
When?
And I'm arranging deportation papers.
Er. well, nowhere special.
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
Oh, God...
-- but he didn't.
John?  What is it?
You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
I put you away --
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
That's an old one.  One of our first.
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
You're part of my flock now, John. Welcome.
You can let him look around, answer his questions, but watch him.  If there's any problems, make sure we know about it first.
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
You don't have to do this, Chief.
We need confirmation on the time frame.  Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
The mall?
You guys are nodding your heads like you actually know what the hell he's talking about.
Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
So I'll be the first one to go in then?
If it's a question of authority.
But you call this room the "temple".
Sorry.  Old habit.  I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.  My father was a minister.  Lutheran.
She was looking right at me.
She spoke to me.
Wally, listen to me...
Are these all of her previsions?
Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
What happened?  Where's the rest?
I scored a goal!
Sean -- you're not real.
I was looking for you...
You're supposed to kill me.  He said you would.
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
Who made you do this?
Heal who?
I believe in that system...
Where?
Oh, God, what did you do?
Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
I understand.
He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?
Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
Lamar, I found something.
It's the same prevision.
By fooling the system.  All someone would have to do is wait for Precrime to stop the murder from taking place, then, a few minutes later, commit the crime in exactly the same way.
Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got some images I can work with?
Sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.
Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?
This your work?
It was nobody's fault.
Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
You know I need to use you.
To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
It's on West Broadway.
So, wait, you're from where?
He's great, right. Is he great?
Oh no. What is it this time.
It's a poison arrow tree frog.
No.
Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.
C'mon girl. Eat up.
So what do we do?
Where we going?
You like the ponies?
You bet the ponies?
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
Yes.
Jesus Christ, where the fuck you been all night? You look like you got shit out in the gorilla house.
Taken care of?
Sorry, man, but...
Any time, bro.
I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.
Ask if he said anything to her.
I'll page you with the number.
So I'm like, 'Maybe I'm not on the list cause I'm not a fuckin Persian.'
Damn right, I have. You think I like living on fucking Yucca? We do a good job on this, we're in.
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's.
Max won't let me drive Jess to dance anymore.
Right here's fine.
You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here.
Who you calling?
C'mon, man...
How much was it?
Great. On my fucking room.
Nothing else.
What the fuck is that supposed --
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
You fucking nuts?
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
Look who's back? Want some champagne?
What the hell did you do?
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
Nothing, man.
Let's check out the penguins.
We need guns.
Eighty.
Eighty five.
It's gonna be fine.
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.
Where's the surprise?
Did you see that shit? Motherfucker.  You let in fucking Screech, dude? I'm waiting and you let in Screech?
It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
How do you know it's not drugs?
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
Stop.
The Welsh dude, sees all these niggers in perms and diamonds and shit, he gets nervous. But you motherfuckers, he just laughs. All beat up in your babaloo suit like Fruitpie the Magician.
Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
I'm half Irish.
No?
Nah, man...
Yeah.
Keys.
We're square.
What the fuck you think, I wanna 'hang' with you motherfuckers? Yeah you're working. And put down the champagne.
No...
Well, that's news to me. The name's Tom.
You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
Don't never write nothing down. File it up here, like I do.  'Cause if they can't find no paper they ain't got no proof. Ya dig?
How's it feel?
Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street?
I told you less paper, less trouble.
You're a damn liar.
Let Billie finish.
Take it easy, baby.
I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is we got to get you back on your feet.
The dirty yellow rat bastard.
You ain't lying.
Why? Why does everybody conk?
Don't con me.
What? Everybody knows God is White.
What the hell for, man?
Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words.
Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.
You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.
I don't know what to say to Allah.
Folks are sitting out there today, not next week, expecting to hear our program.
What points?
Could we sit down someplace?
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
At a gas station.  Will you marry me?
It will be rough.
Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
Is she hooking?
The average first offender gets two years for burglary. We were all first offenders. That's what Sophia and Peg drew --
But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
-- there is a serious question as to whether --
Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
Sweetie, they're almost ready.
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
Bang, bang. You're dead.
Don't never try to cross someone who ain't afraid to die.
What did you do, Homey, palm it?
I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.
What am I doing here?
You have a rather checkered past. Mr. Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages long.
A lot of people are looking for you.
Where do I find you?
What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos.
[Daniel Rosas Sanchez.]
[What is his name?]
[How does it work?]
[Who's Tazinari?]
Who's he?
[That's all I know! Please. I'm sorry for the girl. But it was business! I'm a professional.]
What is it?
When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?
So what's wrong?
Yeah, right...
You been working?
You did something on impulse?
Stomach's gone. But... okay.
Fuck. Look at you; you won't last a day the shape you're in. Unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen removed.
That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him with when he left.
Potential? I don't understand.
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
Did you like school, Creasy?
Hmmm?
Did you sleep alright?
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
Remember you asked me what state I was from?
Did you used to?
Could I ask you a question?
Pinta, we've got to go. Travel sucks at this time.
That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
Be a swimmer.
Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
The world of our children. How dare they?
Sorry.
Rosanna Guerrero.
The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
If she pisses you off, you get another one.
And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.
[OK, repeat the drop instructions.]
Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English.
He has experience in related work. A great deal of it.
I think it's nice he's American.
Creasy.
It will be a hard break.
[I know this. Your point?]
[Then what do you have to lose?]
[Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday.]
Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in lemon and orange juice. It's a stew really.
Tell me about your friend Creasy.
You and Creasy both. A two man army according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders.  You two were a married couple.
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
It's early.
Hey! What are you doing here?
I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!"
That's my son Thomas's baby.
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
Marty.
You will see. A coupla months, you gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law's house.
Yeah.
...you teach chemistry? That's funny. Where? What school?
Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter. Because she's always writing them to come out there. So it's a nice little shop. I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. The point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. There's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an A&P coming in, at least that's the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade is strictly Italian, but the younger Italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old Italian dishes so much. I mean, you gotta take that into account too.
It's only a quarter of twelve. The clock's right over there.
Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?
Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow night then.
You say something?
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
Oh, that's nice. So the doctor was wrong, wasn't he?
...so the whole book winds up, Mike Hammer, he's inna room there with this doll. So he says, "You rat, you are the murderer." So she begins to con him, you know? She tells him how she loves him. And then Bam! He shoots her in the stomach. So she's laying there, gasping for breath, and she says, "How could you do that?" And he says, "It was easy."
All right, I'll see you, Thomas, because he wants an answer by Monday.
Don't worry about it.
Wadda you wanna buy a shop for, will you tell me? You gotta good job, you got no wife, you got no responsibilities. Boy, I wish I was you, boy. Waddaya wanna tie yourself down with a shop? What's he want? Five thousand down? You're gonna have to carry a mortgage sixty, seventy bucks a month. A mortgage anna note from the bank. For Pete's sake, you're a single man with no responsibilities. Stay that way, boy. Take my advice.
Hello, Marty, when you coming home? Where you now? Because your cousin Thomas and his wife Virginia, they're here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine... I don't know...
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
It's loaded with what?
Oh, Thomas. Ma, it's just a big dance hall, and that's all it is. I been there a hundred times. Loaded with tomatoes. Boy, you're funny, Ma.
Did you offer the young lady some fruit?
Ma, I'm gonna take her home now. It's getting late, and the buses only run about one an hour.
...and they sit down right next to me...
I'm with a girl, Ralph.
I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
I just wanna thank you people again, because the situation was just becoming impossible.
I know what you're gonna say. A man's gotta stop being his mother's baby sooner or later. How many times you gonna say it? She's my mother, you know. I oughta have some feelings about her, don't you think?
There's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention.
We wanted to tell you how you were helping us with your fixes.
How they goin', Losing Preacher? What do you hear from the Pope?
Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
Epidural hematoma?
Thou. For Thou art with me.  Welcome, welcome, welcome!
You mind if we get out of this guy's brain first?
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
You got directions?
Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
This kid looks like a loser. Maybe we better get the bead-jiggler to put in a fix.
There's no transportation anyway this time of night.
I thought we were heading for trouble putting on all these trinkets.
We think the same way.
Ravenous. What about you?
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
I was just asking...
Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.
The hell we won't! You bastards pulled something, I don't know what, but we've been beating you without him. Ane we'll go on beating you!
Or you can let him knock himself out. You personally'd be sending him to his grave.
I came within about ten yards of you. You know something, Trapper, the way we been going, if we ever got to see a real golf course again, I bet we could burn it up.
Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
Is he out?
We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
He only lasted one season.
Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
You're getting a workout, you and Captain Forrest, your first night.
Our minds?
You're an attractive man.
You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
Even if I weren't.
You're on his side all of the sudden?
A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!
He's coming to.
There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.
Painless, you mustn't talk that way. It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?
No, never in the slightest.
In the direction you want to go.
How much time do I have?
First decent idea you've had in a month.
Fifteenth straight day there've been six o'clock choppers. How long can a battle go on?
If you say so, Henry. But remember my claustrophobia.
We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
Sir?
Sir?
Splendid, sir. No problems.
This one goes right to the OR. Tell Duke to do him ahead of the busted spleen.  And this kid can't wait. I'll take him myself, before I get to that ruptured diaphragm.
Did you get it, too?
Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
Yes!
Say, he's a friend of mine.
Hello, John.
Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
Can I help you pack?
Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?
Do it, and I'll give you a hundred dollars a week.
Hello. Whenever there's a pretty woman around, er—  This is my nephew, Ted Sheldon, Miss Mitchell.
Oh!
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Lemme get this through this lame brain of mine. Are you suggesting we go out and hire someone to say he's gonna commit suicide on Christmas Eve? Is that it?
Who, for instance?
But, he's gonna jump off a building!
Duets? But can we trust him?
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
Have you seen him?
just called the morgue, boss. They say there's a girl there—
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Gee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton told me not to leave him, not even for a minute.
Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc. Gimme that again, will yuh? Who's gonna get him?
Aw, Long John . . . I tell you—it's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither! 
Hey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me.
I gotta figure some way out of this thing!
I see. I'd better stick to running the paper, huh?
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and—
What's your name?
That's a lie! Listen—don't believe what he says . . .
Flowers.
Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh!
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
Not that we know of.
No shit! He's good!
Where's the stereo?
Who is it?
Could I please have a little water?
Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
I hate fucking Springfield.
Really?
Manual or automatic?
Who are you again?
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
For now that's all.
We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?
It rarely has to be done.
What's the point of this?
Come on. Let's go for a drink.
She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
You think you can learn, McCall?
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off... Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainer/jockey combo does well. We can't leave him out.  What do you think?
I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.
Ronnie... Yeah, so.
The 6 horse is last.
The 6 horse is still last.
They need to run first and second?
It might have happened no matter who was up there.
This baseball player you're going out with...  He's no good for you.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I wanted to get this out of the way.
That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much?
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?
Yeah?
How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy.
...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing...
It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack...
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
And a car.
It's okay.
She said I have a son...
That's a strange question.  You a strange man?
You sealed off the system.  When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
Unlimited energy out there.  Enough to run this world for all eternity --
But once the system touches the net, all links are severed.  Everybody dies.
You sure he's going to come?
What's her name?
He had keys.
Two maze runners.
Won't be time if he gets access --
Christoph was in charge of designing building modules.
Then you had her killed.
There was no need to kill her.
I'm sorry sir, we need your debit card before we can issue a credit --
Most nights you wake up crying. Never knowing why.
And it meant something.
So how can we get to it?
Anybody see anything?
1600 m.p.h.  and increasing!
Ay, yi, yi!  The Rangers are going to be CRUSHED!
Two thirty three a.m.
We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place.
Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.
No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting.
But boss, what about their parents?
Simon says...
What!
Mordant, go with them and report back to me!
I am the mighty ape!
I'm Bobby Clowes. Kansas City.
The goddamned bastards.
The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
I ain't mad. I ain't even surprised. But I can't let ya fuck me. On the other hand, if ya got needs beyond the thirty-five, I'll advance it to you against our next deal on the same terms.
I got my partner in there!
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
Shane was a friend of yours?
How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
Where'd ya get this funny ravioli?
Come on. It's Christmas. At least stay for breakfast.
Have you thought about this?
Would it be painful for you?
At least Masseria plays by the rules. Maranzano thinks he's God, and the rules don't apply.
You bastards, I said twenty!
Yeah. So who the fuck does?
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.
I like that.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks.
Sure. But ya got a deck a cards? I wanna play some Klob.
We combine everything. You are my second in command.
If you give him the chance, Lansky will betray you like Judas.
At first, it will hurt you. But you will come to understand and we will be strong together.
Know somethin'? This stuff's just kick-the-can on ponies.
Anything ain't a very hard number.
Jeez, Bugsy. Ya like ta scared the crap outta me.
Best we got.
Chasing me - animals - horrible -
Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare.
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
What's the matter?
You're really gonna pop the question?
Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.
You know, Julie, even if this works - which it probably won't - that stuff is tricky. You don't know what it'll do to his brain.
Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls ...Mr. Stu Miley, in the <u>house</u>! <i></i> This is an <u>honor</u>. We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like <u>caviar</u>, man. You da <u>shits</u>!!
Uh huh. And?
Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick.
Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.
Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me!
Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep call you - ?
I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.
Hypnos?
I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
Excuse me, sir.  I just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday.
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
You want to come inside?
I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
How are you doing sweetheart?
It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?
I'm sorry.  I had a wretched night.
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.
Calendar for the day. You'll find the Senate Manual in the drawer. Anything else you want, just snap for a page.
It was?
You've never *seen* this contract.
Then--this is *not* you signature, Senator?
Tell me why!
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
Oh--that again. Yeah.
Ah. One of the supporting characters.
The Silver Knight. Soul of Honor--on a tight-rope.
You play--left field.
Did you like the first act?
Well--I stuck my foot in it again at the President's press conference today--  How come so early? Get the day off?
Forget it, kid. What's it *to* you?
Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
And I got him all dressed up, too-- to go way up in a balloon--so they can drop him a long way--make sure they break his heart. Why, not all the Boy Rangers in the world, working night shifts, 'll be able to put Humpty-Dumpty together again--
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
*All right*, then. After all, what's it to me? So they *drop* him out of a balloon. All I care is--I don't want to be around. See? Squeamish. See? That's what I am. No, sir. I don't have to take it. Won't be a party to no murder. I'm gonna quit. I'm through.
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
My first name's--Clarissa.
I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir.
Well--let's dig up the preacher, kid.
All I know is--he said to me tonight-- "What does your wife think?" My wife. Thinks we're married--
The war's on!
Diz!
Taylor, my dear.
Dinner, Hubert.
Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something?
Good. Are the newspaper men at the hotel?
Look here, Jim--if you and Joe are going to gab about this appointment *any* longer, I'm going ahead and see those committees!
One minute! Just one minute!
I said forget 'em! Horace Miller goes to the Senate--and that settles it!
*You won't?*
But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--
Boy Ranger! The answer to a prayer. Manna from heaven! Didn't know the time of day--!
No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
Well--yes--I was saying--the State should reward you--
What were you saying, Governor? Sorry.
"Boy Stuff." That's the name of Jeff's magazine. He prints it.  Look--here's one--oh, it's great-- *everybody* reads it--all the kids in the State--a million of 'em. Look, Pop--let me read you a--
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
Well--goodnight.
Will the Senator--
Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
Yes, sir, I yield for a question.
Please, sir!--come with me!
Oh, now--
Yes, Ma?
Now, if you're ready, Senator, we can start for the hotel. I'll *see* that you get there.
No, gee--I couldn't stay here--
Go ahead--punch.
Oh, yes. And *I'm* helping. Simple-- and I'm helping. So we knock this off in record-breaking time of--let's say three or four days--
Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?
I know. It's--Violet.
What do they--? Who are all those--?
Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.
And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!
What you *have* to do is fight!
Jeff--wait--they want you to speak!
Whoa! Hold it! Pipe down! Come on, now--that's enough of that.
Just for the fun of it.--You see the one that makes it back home in the fastest time, I am going to enter in the nationals.
Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.
Order, gentlemen!
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
You can't find it in racing forms, Chick.
Here, Jeff, I'll advance it for you.-- Fine introduction to the nation's capital!
Chick--
Be quiet, Chick--I'm trying to think--  This Deficiency Bill is going to be read in the Senate tomorrow.
Look, Nosey--your pals would like to get in on this, wouldn't they?
Yeah?  And what else?
That Happy Hopper is tougher to handle than a prima-donna.
That'd be a crime--after all this work--getting it buried in this Deficiency Bill as nice as you please-- approved--all ready to roll--
Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home.
You can't say *that* to--
His first 'whiff'!
Mr. President...
Senator Paine will state it!
Is there objection?  You may proceed, Senator.
Yes.
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
They think he's pixilated.
Pixilated.
He sure is pixilated.
Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow.
I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.
Are these the articles?
You fainted.
It's awfully nice of you to show me around like this.
Have you seen the papers?
What did you mean by that?
I've often thought about going back.
He played in the town band, too.
Couldn't sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?
I wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  Huh? Well, I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes that I've met.
I didn't think you could come with the party and everything.
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
The guy's balmy.
Can I have a month's vacation?
Did it?
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
Hang up.
That's pretty.
Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on.
How do you do.
I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me.
It's merely a suggestion. I don't wish to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything. It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something.
No, I'm his housekeeper.
Oh, it'll do in a pinch.
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
You shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate?
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
Let him alone.
Mrs. Semple?
I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.
No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married—
Hear what he said? You know how much twenty million is?
Where is your farm?
Is she home?
You mean—  —by the neck or something?
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
Twenty! What did he do with them?
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
Please!
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon.
I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it --
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
But you do therapy?
I have eighteen more minutes!
-- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew --
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here.
Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to...  ...I really appreciate what you're trying to... uh, I can't thank you enough for...
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
What it might take is... doing time.
Don't you at least have a back door I can use?
I just got my license two weeks ago.
What's wrong with her?
Hiya, Doc.
How are you?
Feel free to lie down. Most people do.
What?
Is this the treatment?
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
Is that when you split up?
Which thing?
First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.
Hello?
Mother...
I guess you saw the show...?
Sofie...
You feel violated?
I am irate!
Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff?
The school board doesn't pay you? What kind of deal is that?
So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely?
Amazing.
Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her.
Hey, Skip.
You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
How's it coming?
Damn! What is your name?
What about it?
Skip, I've got a problem and I need some advice.
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
Sorry...
It's possible. I don't know about that.
You know where he's taking her?
How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways?
Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good.
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.
The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds.
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --
Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
The sun turning black.
The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
Where are they taking him?
No women allowed.
Two hundred pounds.
Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead? Truly?
No?
How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra?
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
I don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living. It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child. It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit.
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am.
Oh my god, I've dreamed about this ever since I was a little girl.
Is he supposed to look like that?
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
No we are not. We woke him up, and we must try and stop him.
Then we'll have to find some immortal ones.
That's what I am to you? A contract?
He's here! I saw him! That thing is here!
You...! YOU...!
Oh yes I do! I have something right here!
I found it, Evy! I found it
Believe it, sister. That's what brought our buddy back to life.
I knew you'd know.
Um-hmm.
Everything's going exactly as we planned.
It must have slipped my mind.
Hey, do I look like a Man?
Sounds good to me.
Mon Captain, it's for you. 
Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.
I hope you enjoy these cigars. I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them.
Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.
Are you an actress?
How 'bout giving me "the tour"?
Who's the artist?
Come here.
What?
Stay away!
Yeah.
Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
At the Frankenstein Center.
So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?
Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil.
But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!
We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever. 
Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.
Have you ever seen him?
Roy, remember, it is all within your power. The only thing that's in your way... is you.
So you're only invisible, when absolutely no one is looking at you?
Wow.
You did?
She likes you.
To us!
Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.
The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.
Well, has Your Majesty considered what Napoleon's alternatives might be, if you simply chose to ignore his note?
Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it.
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
There are none here.
Josephine dead -- how unbelievable! How impossible it is to believe it. She was always physically so strong -- she was never ill a day in her life.
Who is there?
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
Read it back.
The Emperor has decided to marry your Archduchess, Marie-Louise.
And he sent you to me?
I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.
Will Alexander be joining us soon?
Then what brings you out on such a night?
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.
I hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this, Madame de Beauharnais.  I called to bring this to your son, but I understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon.
And now?
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
Go away -- I'm busy.
How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
Separate bedrooms?
Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.
I believe you sent for me.
Why did you give it to him?
I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.
You mean you heard them making love?
How did you know it was Captain Charles?
And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits?
Now, the section headed "Secret Clauses of the Treaty" -- Article 14b, provides for Alexander to serve as mediator between France and England and, if he fails to achieve a preliminary agreement within four months, it further provides that Russia is to go to war against England, and close her ports to English trade.
And where do you place Alexander?
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on August 15th, 1769.  He had not been a healthy baby and his mother, Letizia, lavished him with care and devotion.  In middle age, he would write about her from St. Helena.
Stretch it out.
Where you going?
No I'm not.
Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend.
Sorry, bro, reflexes.  How did you do that?
She pepper-sprayed me, man!  She pepper- sprayed me!
Just a little.
Damn, you got a stalker.
I ain't trying to get in it.
Alright, Roach, see you around.
You see that?
You make it sound so easy.
Most definitely.
I did.  Is that door locked?
Can I help you?
Here I come!
What's the matter?
I gotta get'em fixed.  They don't roll down.
Did you see that?  That was a W.W.F. hit right there, huh, Day-Day?
Are they still out there?
Roach...Roach, come on.
What?!  What that mean?
Wet your eyes, boy.  Stay in there for about 20 minutes.
When my back gets better I'mma beat the black off you, Day-Day.
Get on.
You too big.
Debo!  Debo!
Need to lose some weight.
My back.
Craig, I want you to meet my old lady, Suga.  Suga, this is Craig.
Okay, okay, that's enough.  Go put on some damn clothes.
Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem...
You were saying?  Your daughter....?
She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure to get your autograph.
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
Can we go now?
Could I see some identification, sir?
Come with us, sir.
I will do no such thing.
Look at your watch. Look at it! At one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!
This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
Are you 'fucking with me!?
You get another chance in ten minutes.
What would you do in my place?
You killed him.
...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together.
Yes, you're right, I don't understand.
We have to hurry.
You got anything smaller?
It's a twenty.
Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about.
I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this situation?
Oh, Jesus ...
Then why'd you drag me into it?
Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
Oh, we'll have to do better than that.
Goddamnit, you fuckin' bum, come here!
Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?
I'm not a baby.
I've got something for you.
God can't help her, Mr. Watson. Only you can help her.
Yeah.
You killed two men, Ben Harper.
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you.
O, she's all right.
Uncle Birdie!
See ye got two more peeps to your brood.
What can we do, Mother?
Lynch him! Lynch him!
I must wend my way down River on the Lord's work.
What could have possessed that girl!
Ain't no sense in it, neither. I figured somethin' like this was brewin' when she went to bed last night.
She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...
Tell me a story, John.
Where are we goin', John?
John?
Are we goin' home, John?
John, where's your folks?
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
Tell me what, boy?
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
You don't reckon I'd leave you.
Now: Where?
I'll tell you a secret.
Sure, that's no secret.
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
I'm hungry.
Can I have milk too?
Surely. I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
The Lord is merciful! What a day is this! -- And there's little John!
You'll whip me!
This gentleman warn't like them! He just give me a sody and the book.
So we'll guard her together. Through the night.  In each others' arms like we always said.
Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street.
M'god, I look twenty years old.  You have any weird dreams last night?
Listen, I got a crazy favor to ask.
Yeah. So?
Me!? Why would anyone want to kill me?!
How you doing, pal?
Hello Nancy.
I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please.
Apparently he was crazy jealous. Nancy said they'd had a fight, Rod and Tina.
Get into bed.
Screw sleep!
Feeling better?
How could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it?
No.
What you mean 'all at once'?
Do you think I did it?
Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep. Couldn't get back to sleep at all.  So what you dream?
When did you have a nightmare?
Thank you, Comrade.
I'll tell you later.  That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.
And you too, Ninotchka.
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
No, that's not him...
Imagine, for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower.
It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must have been in Paris! You can see it in his whole attitude! He just picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it.
And the surprise is there's nothing in it.
...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
Capitalistic methods...
We don't like Razinin.
May I ask how much your rooms are?
How are things in Moscow?
Which lawyer?
Comrade Buljanoff...
About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.
Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.
Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.
Your breakfast, monsieur.
Have you?
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike"?
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
I don't want to go to the Hotel Terminus.
You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is all non-sense.
We can call our ambassador.
This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.
Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka.
All right, go ahead, get her on the witness stand! What can she say?
What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade?
She says she won't be intimidated by parasites. She called the Duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer.
We may have a chance.
We cannot feed the Russian people on your intentions. Fifty per cent to a so-called Duchess!... Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy! Comrade Kopalski, go at once to our Embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in Paris.
How are you, you three scoundrels?
Now, comrades... there is something better in life than crumbs of French pastry.
I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...
Yes!
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square...  I hope you'll forgive me but I thought you'd...
Four massive piers of masonry are sunk to a depth of forty-six feet on the side of the Seine, and twenty- nine and one-half feet on the other side. The girders of interlaced iron- work which stay the structure have an inclination of fifty-four degrees...
You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.
I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
So that is your house?
Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
That is correct.
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?
I can't possibly think of a better reason.
But, Ninotchka, I held you in my arms. You kissed me!
On which boat?
Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?
You see I couldn't shout that.
Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.
Not white, darling.
What shall we get? The news!
There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....
Is this the wish of the masses?
Those newspaper people?
I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific. "Caviar and Blood." Swana escapes over the ice!
Did I hear something about jewels?
That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.
Will you do me a favor? Stop talking about the good old days.
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
Now, please, Swana.
That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
Isn't it amazing! One gets a wrong impression of the new Russia.  It must be charming. I'm glad conditions are so improved. I assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?
Good morning.
I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here.
Don't worry, you were quite rude enough.  Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least.
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.
You want me to go to Constantinople?
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
I am sorry... I have to leave.
Hunt has nothing to lose now.  Pardon all of them.  Nobody's going to investigate a crime for which the criminals have already been pardoned.
He's right.  Maybe it's time to go to the hang-out route, John.  A full and thorough investigation ... We've cooperated with the FBI, we'll cooperate with the Senate.  What do we have to hide?
I understand that, sir.
Is it?
How the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the President of the United States?
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
Hunt?  Howard Hunt?
Goddamn! How long have we had this fucking dog?!  Two years, he still doesn't come!  We need a dog that looks happy when the press is around.
The country's loving it.
No, sir, you did not.
I don't have a pistol.
It's the President's personal property!  I will never give up my tapes to a bunch of Kennedy-loving Harvard Democrat cocksuckers!
... an action that will at last, once and for all, show that what I knew and what I did with regard to the Watergate break-in and cover-up were just as I have described them to you from the very beginning ...
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
They did what?!  I don't understand. Why'd they go into O'Brien's office in the first place?
Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper.  You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation.
He works for Colson.  He used him on the Pentagon Papers.  We're trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a White House consultant.  After the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his White House safe.
On the list of horribles, I know what he is.  And I know what he tracks back to.  You say he was involved in the Plumbers?
Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...
Christ, you're right -- Gray makes Jerry Ford look like Mozart.  Just have Helms call him.  Helms can scare anybody.
Where are they?
Alright.  But why, if Kennedy is so clean in all this, didn't he cancel Track 2?
We really must go, Mr. President.
We've got to turn the faucet off on this thing.  It's out of control ...  You might burden just me with this in the future.
We could leverage Helms.
I promised Iran to Townsend.
Richard ... come with me, would you ...
Is there something else that's bothering you, Mr. President?
President Kennedy threatened to smash the CIA into a thousand pieces.  You could do the same ...
Roselli?  Johnny Roselli?
We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.
Yeah, you do.  I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
I know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a Republican, and she'd do anything for the Party.
Hell, Kennedy's pissed Cuba away to the Russians.  And he don't know what the hell he's doing in Vietnam.  These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business ...
Because if you're uncomfortable with the EPA up your ass, try the IRS ...
No, Henry.  I don't.
Secret, Mr. Chairman?
So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?
Hi.
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
No, we don't!  You're full of shit! You say you want to end the war, so why don't you?  My brother died over there last November.  Why?  What good was his death?
Someone wants it ...  You can't stop it, can you?  Even if you wanted to.  Because it's not you. It's the system.  And the system won't let you stop it ...
You know, Fred, they sell tickets.
You're not a failure, Dick.
What are you saying?  What are you talking about?
Buddy? ...
They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too.
Anything.
I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything.  But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them.  Because you have absolutely no remorse.  No concept of remorse.  You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ...
Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
"Checkers" of course, Hiss, Ike's heart attack, Venezuela, the Kitchen Debate, and Kennedy.
Some say you are, Rocky.
I am older.
That man that shot you died in prison.
...Shot down on his own porch there in Hudspeth County. There was seven or eight of 'em come to the house. Wantin' this and wantin' that. Mac went back in and got his shotgun but they was way ahead of him. Shot him down in his own doorway.  Aunt Ella run out and tried to stop the bleedin'. Him tryin to get hold of the shotgun again. They just set there on their horses watchin' him die. Finally one of 'em says somethin' in Injun and they all turned and left out. Well Mac knew the score even if Aunt Ella didn't. Shot through the left lung and that was that. As they say.
Nineteen zero and nine.
...What you got ain't nothin' new. This country is hard on people. Hard and crazy. Got the devil in it yet folks never seem to hold it to account.
Yes.
Hard to believe.
Not word one.
Who's he in trouble with then?
These boys is all swole up. So this was earlier: gettin set to trade. Then, whoa, differences... You know: might not of even been no money.
We goin' in?
You think this boy Moss has got any notion of the sorts of sons of bitches that are huntin' him?
You gonna drive out there?
How's that, Sheriff?
...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
...Be careful.
Don't hurt no one.
I mean, would you care to join me.
...How'd you sleep?
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
No.
Did you buy that gun?
Why all the way to Del Rio?
Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?
...Where's the transponder?
Who is this.
Yes, I do. I think you do too. So this is what I'll offer. You bring me the money and I'll let her go. Otherwise she's accountable. The same as you. That's the best deal you're going to get. I won't tell you you can save yourself because you can't.
How much?
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
Yes.
Just call it.
Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky quarter.
Tent poles.
Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.
It's all right.
...You pick the option with the applicable rate.
No, one forty-two.
It's called a transponder.
Took me about three hours.
...What do you do?
I ask questions. If I get sensible answers then they get to go to America. If I don't get sensible answers they don't. Is there anything about that that you don't understand?
Are you in the service?
Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?
...plenty
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
I questioned Joyce about all this...
Junior year!
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
Who are these idiots?
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
Do you know why I'm here?
...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
...I don't think I know that hospital.
Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
You never gave us a chance...
I just want everything to be perfect between us.
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
Why are you doing this to me?
Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
George...
What was that?
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
What're you doing here, Roy?
So you're into "Reason," too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you?
Let me tell you something. I got groped by these Tunisian guys who thought I was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and I got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. Plus, it ended my marriage --
I left my husband two days ago.
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
You're hurting him!!
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
Guess who I saw today.
Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
You should have a little faith in people.
Your husband?!
Blake, I can handle that transplant!
That won't be necessary. She's staying with a Rosa something... Hernandez, Herrera. I know it's an 'H' sound... in Silverlake.
I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy...  Who's birthday?
You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
We don't know which Buick, do we?
What the hell was that, another statement?
I hope you're right...
Joyce was screwing Del.
I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such poise, too.  Very, very impressive...
Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming?
They said find it. Find her, find it. Finish the job you were paid to do.
That was a really shitty thing to do.
We should go.
"When I grow up I'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral..."  Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you?
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
Wesley...
What in the...  What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking time!
I said 'got it?'
What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
Not her mouth...  I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon.
If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
Really?
Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
Right, uhh... I feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party.  But... I'd be honored if you'd come.
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty...
What did you say?
You lie, motherfucker...
Aren't they precious?  Ma'am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the area?
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
Huh?
I flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. The one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.
Waitaminute -
Whuhh...
Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective!  You ever been with a woman?
Huh. I guess they'll tack on fifty years for me too.
We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett.
We ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we mass communicatin'!
Them straw polls is ugly.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Have him join us, run our campaign 'stead a that pencil-neck's.
...Time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.
I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.
Well, I'm sorry honey -
Well now honey, that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake.
Who was fixing to betray us!
Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.
...No treasure... I had two weeks left on my sentence...
Daddy!
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
Who gave you this idea?
Who's that?
Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!
Good morning, girls.
Joe!
When did this happen?
Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
She may not make it through the program, but she's got more heart and more character than you'll ever have. I've seen your college record. I've never heard of most of those schools. Tell me something, Mayo. Did you buy that degree?
Stop eyeballing me, mister! I've looked through your file and done a little checking, and I know it all. I know about your mother. I know your old man's an alcoholic and a whore chaser.  Life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! Hasn't it, Mayo?
No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.
I want to fly, sir!
No, sir!
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
Hi, son.
You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?
Whatever you say, Mayonnaise.
Something tells me you've been here before.
Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple of things I want to tell you.
Sid, there's no baby.
You serious about having him over?
Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?
Lynette, where's Sid?
You stayed after all.
Paula, I never try to fool anybody about who I am, what I want... so if even in the back of your --
You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.
So, after you graduate you go on to basic flight, right? Is that in Pensacola?
Your real father was an Officer candidate like me?
Call me during the week if you get the chance.
I'm looking for Sid.
Please stop it. None of that's true. Goddamnit, I love you. I loved you ever since I met you.
Two bucks a buckle, Perryman. Look at that shine! Boonies'll cost you five.
You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.
The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.
That Foley looks like he's been through a war or two.
That isn't true, is it?
I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
No problem.
Stop it!  Stop it!
Me.  I am.
You can.  You're full of ideas.  You just need to squeeze one out.
One.  Squeeze.
Fuck!
Forty-five minutes.  That's all you said you need.  That's like nothing.
Got her right where you want her, Junior.
Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
And we're never getting in.
You don't look so good.
Push that button for me, will you?
We're not gonna do anything about him, he's fine.
That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my idea to get the plans, I found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at no point did I say "you" or Raoul," got it?
Suit yourself.
Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?
The phone works.  Hey, I hooked up the phone.
What if they get in here?
Oh, please.
YOU HAVE TO!
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
If it looks like I can't get back, just close the door.
Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?
Alma I told you to...
No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...
Like?
Hey... what the hell you doing?
I ain't gonna shoot you Judge. Look... it's over. Just run away. Get out. Stay away from Oakland. Cause it's gone... it's gone.
Sabu, what the fuck you doing? Ain't nobody gonna push on this street.
Check it out... Great huh? I tell you those guys know what time it is. Man I'm with that...
Have to pass on the revolution today man, I got class... But how about tonight, I was gonna check out "Cloud Nine." Just like old times.
...Glad you came man.
I don't think that will be any problem...
...at least that takes Bobby Seale off the street...
We'll get them. Right now we got to worry about being armed and ready to protect Betty Shabazz. Those phonies sure as hell can't. We need guns.
Alright, I'll stay. Judge, I want to...
You were. infantry right?
Judge... we're doing security for Betty Shabazz's visit next week. I'd like to have someone who knows there way around a pistol there. Someone like you.
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?
What it be Judge. Nobody got hurt, Sister Betty's safe. This was a good day...
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?
Unh... Unh Man... I don't take no money from friends that need help. Fuck no. What do you think I am a bum?
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
Congratulations.
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
He reminds me of you before you got old and ugly.
You don't know him very well, do you?
If you go, I'll care for them as if they were my own.
Excuse me?
We did.
That is a separate issue.
Civility is a secondary virtue.  It is superseded by duty.
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
If this war is about more than Thomas, it's about more than Anne, as well.  Stay the course.
You don't hate him.
An American nation.  Colonel Lee, with your permission?
Mister Robinson, I fought with Captain Marion in the French and Indian War, including the Wilderness Campaign.  We served as scouts under Washington and I have no doubts about Captain Marion's courage or competence on a battlefield. There's not a man in this room, or anywhere, for that matter, to whom I would more willingly trust my life.
... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery...
Wars are not fought only by childless men.  A man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles.
And your principles?
We saw.
Fall, six months at the earliest.
Not held, just slowed down.
And congratulations on the birth of your son.
Thank you.
How many came back?
Colonel, let us help his soul find it's place with the Almighty and...
Father, I saw a post rider at the house.
Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.
Honey, Church will be fine.
Please hurry.
I want to look around, daddy-- may I?
Then why do I have to go to bed?
What were you listening to?
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
Doesn't look like they last long.
I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But...
Can I have another one?
You and this old Indian rag-man--
Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?
Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago?
Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
And Buckaroo Banzai.
The movers--
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
My God!
She's finally asleep.
Thank you, Louis.
That boat is my livelihood!
Enough of that!  Name your terms.
We got that part.  Anything else?
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
That's your offer?  You, sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl, and all I have is a name?
I'll watch my back.
You'd best take a swim, Jack.
You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.
Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?
No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
You're speaking up for him again?
I knew it.
I know the code.
But ... you did it before!  Last time --
You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees, thank the Lord.  We've got some food on the trees, thank the Lord again.  And we've got rum, praise the Lord.  We can stay alive a month, maybe more.  Keep a weather eye open for passing ships, and our chances are fair.
That was before I met one, of course.
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
Dead serious.
Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
What's your name?
The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
Agreed.
Is that so?
Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
Tortuga?
Wait -- what about the pistol?
He may be.
Captain Norrington... I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.
What did you use?
Please, O'Brien, don't do this to me!  I'll give you anything you want!
Like rotting meat.
A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.
Can you feel it, Poppy?  The presence of the moment?  Can you feel the weight of its significance?
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
It'll be better for us if he simply disappears.  The gardener will know what to do.
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
Do you remember about five years ago, that uh... incident at Purnell Labs?
What did security say?
You were never invited to my house.
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
Is that what Argon told you?
I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
Like Crazy Glue?
Susan!
Daniel...
Oh no.  Not by a long shot.  I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same.
We'll see?  What does that mean?
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
Oh no, no, no!  You've got to be able to fix me!  Please, Susan, tell me you can make me normal again!
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
What do these replicators do to people?
What's that supposed to mean?
You have no one to blame but yourself.
Run, Daniel!  Get out of here!
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
Exactly.
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
May I use your telephone?
What do you want?
Ah!  But you don't know who Bobo is. And you don't know who Babykins is.
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
You wear them of course, silly.
Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I—
Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?
That's an excellent idea.
Fine. Have a seat.
This way.
What do you want?
It's all right. You can write your own ticket. A hundred and fifty bucks a week.
Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?
Right - for the first time this year.
Now listen boss, if you're going to kick about that expense account—
Is that so?
Araby?
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
Yes.
That's a lovely dress.
Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?
Do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates?
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
How far have you gotten?
Did who?
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
What other girl—?
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
Come in, Joe. It's all right.
Stop calling me Mother!
He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.
But I—
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
Yes sir.
You sure you want to know this?
Yes ...  It's just that ...
Oh no ... I'm fine.
Thank you.
No she's not.
You can't go out there.
Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue.
What?
To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
It's six-thirty ...
Don't! Just let go.
Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it when it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too.  You might even call it "love."
But it could happen.
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
I'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town.  You know what I mean by "changes"?
Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
Do you know that it's illegal?
I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.
Oh my God.
Does he--you know--like "me"?
It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  If you need anything, I'll be right over there.
You have no right to do this.
What's wrong?
You're reading?
Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
This thing works. We could go home right now.
Besides. You think there's like a chance I'm gonna get into college back there?
Keeps going ...
Mmmmgh.
How?
... Like Prince Charming.
How much does it cost?
Why would I do that?
EXCUSE ME?
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Do you have the lettuce?
Oh hi!
Bud ...
Wow ... That's pretty good ...
It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?
TV repair.
Dream come true, hunh?
So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV tonight?
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
I don't think I'm going to the party.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again?
This is Lena, she's a good friend of mine from work. We were in the neighborhood and she had to pick up her car and we're getting breakfast before we go in, so did you want to go? We're gonna go and eat, let's go.
It's not cool?
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
Why's it here?
-- what are you talking about, come on --
Yes.
Well. I have no way of knowing. So it doesn't matter.
Not very late.
Uh-huh.
I know but I....how much is it?
Come on, I thought we had fun, rich boy --
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
Do you have brothers or sisters?
Who is it?
...really? That's nice...are you lying?
You like her?
You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
Yeah?
Yeah.
That's right you travel so much.
I forgot about that.
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --
Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
You want her to call you Jack?
Now are you threatening me, dick?
I'm a nice and reasonable man. I didn't do anything wrong. Please don't make me hurt you. And I'm telling you: that if you ever hurt me or if you hurt someone that I love.....I will hurt you many, many, many times over.....because it's not right to take people's trust.
You do guaranteed sale? etc.
Yeah.
You ok?
You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?
What happened?
I'm sorry.
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
Seven o'clock.
I know.
I know.
Your expenses are your own.
What's the problem?
Put him through.
It's ok. That's alright.
We should be going --
"To seal the wound, he took a poker from the fire --"
Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
Had I known your taste in novels, I never would've taught you to read.
Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.
It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here...
Go back to your room. Quickly.
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
Take your pen in hand, Marquis. Purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper; maybe they'll govern you less in life.
I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
You've a touch of the poet, too; perhaps you should take up the quill.
If you only mean to dupe me again --
He can't do that to me.
My bed, gone! Am I to freeze to death?
WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?
If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive.
What on earth would that require?
Who's to say I did not?
Surely you'll grant me a final word.
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
On the contrary. Let me take up this matter with the Marquis myself --
It was fiction, of course.
He'll do no such thing.
As for the author... shoot him.
I'll be waiting.
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
Did I frighten you?
They've taken your clothes?
-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!
It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --
Perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them...
If you're truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity --
-- words alone are insufficient.
You've no right to assault me in this fashion; I'll call for my footman. I'll have you removed --
How was I to know, my darling?
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
Doesn't that please you?
Ever met Walter Winchell?
So you ever gonna do a picture?
God, these parties are the worst
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
How bad is it?
I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
I wanna see the picture today
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
This better be good
Fuck you
I remember a man who wrote I He was a brilliant writer who dazzled me time and time again with his wit and insight--
I'll hire you  -- right now-
Why her?
All men love. But men like Hearst -- they don't bother with convention because--
What?
Craig is one syllable
You gonna watch?
What have I done?
You know, all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
He truly doesn't care if he ever works again.
They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints.
Excuse me, I hope this isn't rude, but aren't you Marion Davies?
Very generous
You talked to New York?
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud
A "Z" and a "K" in the title. That would draw the eye. For the poster. I like that THE PRISONER OF ZENDA had a "Z" and a "P" and that worked--
I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!
It's my birthday this week. I'll be 26.
We're from...
What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
What who's been sayin'?
Where you going at this hour?
You're a good sport, lady.
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he think he is? I'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot.
Go 'head.
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
I just weighed myself -- I'm 161. No more deals like this Janiro bullshit. I didn't tell you to do it in the first place.
Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like.
Why not? There's nobody else around who wants to fight me; they're all afraid. I don't see why I shouldn't have a shot at the title right now.
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
You don't talk very much.
You go first. Let me watch how to do this.
Just keep your eye on the ball.
I can't find my ball.
Jake, this is your father's bedroom.
Take off my pants.
Now, touch me...  ...here.
What's the matter with you?
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
Jake, why don't you just try lying down and get some rest.
Why don't you just call him up?
No, not that.
But they don't have a case against you.
I said, let's go.
What do you think, I'm blind? My brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.
It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.
I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
She never left the apartment --
Jeff -- huh?
I can't do that.
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
Yeah? Maybe in the high rent districts they discuss -- but in my neighborhood, they still nag.
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
Right now I'd even welcome trouble.
That's abnormal.
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
Behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause.  What is it? You have a fight?
She's only perfect.
The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.
We've progressed emotionally in --
When I married Myles, we were both maladjusted misfits. We still are. And we've loved every minute of it.
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
Mrs. Thorwald?
You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?
Thank heaven that's over!
No.
Not yet, Jeff.
Goodnight, you idiot.
Anything else bothering you?
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
Big enough?
Yes.
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one.
If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand --
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
Lisa, simmer down -- will you?
Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
Oh, I do that all the time. Whenever I have a few minutes after lunch.
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
So do I.
Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.
They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
I have the whole weekend off.
You said I'd have to live out of one suitcase  I'll bet yours isn't this small?
For a minute, Doyle almost had me convinced I was wrong.
A man is assaulting a woman at one two five west ninth street. Second floor rear. Make it fast.
Where can we meet?
Sure.  It's fine.
I like you, you know?
What time is it?
Tell him why we moved here.
Blood.
Go ahead.
I don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink.
Excuse us a minute?
No!
I don't know.  First I thought it was Jim but--
See?  It stopped.
She keep it to protect herself, sir. She scared without a man in the house.
You scared?
Are you really going to meet them?
Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and everybody!  I think they're going to kill you.
Let's see how long we can stay under.
Isn't he schizoid?
Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
You sure?
You promised to give it back.
I shot at one of them.
They think I'll make friends if we move.  Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
Goodbye!  See you!
I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again.
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
I'm getting that way, too.
What?
Is he your friend?
Do you think your father means that?
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
You need a COAT!
NO!
You sold him out.
No!
We get to the bridge, we're all right!
I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...
I love you, Nick...
They'll have guns.
He wants to see your map.
Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room?
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
You what...
So you could get down her chimney.
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
What'd they call her in high school?
You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.
You got one hour.
A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.
Man, Monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me...
Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access.
So. You're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. You're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front.  You need six.
No.
I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing.
Here ya go, convict. We cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. What you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it.
Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm begging. This is not some card club, 'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an international gaming destination. We're in guidebooks. You can't do this... you can't do this to me...
He won't tell us where it is. The Powwow Safe.
What about the Powwow Safe?
Having romance problems, Romeo?
You knew there were guns in here!
There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
What if she sees you, man, sees what you look like... and it's not there. You just don't do it for her.
Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
Don't look like he missed the sunlight.
Don't move, Rudy!
They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man.
That was my king!
Switch seats with me.
Joe, you're making a terrible mistake I can't let you make.
Daddy, did ya see that?
Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.
We were set up, the cops were waiting for us.
I don't know, but somebody did.
Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...
The Brewers.
I gotta memorize all this shit?
I can do that.
Tell me more about Cabot.
Just hold on buddy boy.
How is he?
Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think...
Wong?
But he's OK. If he wasn't OK, he wouldn't be here. Okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody. But once again, at the risk of being redundant, if I even think I hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their Christian name...  ...you won't want to be you. Okay, quickly.  Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink.
For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my left.
Mr. Pink?  Why?
He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?
He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
What're you talkin' about?
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
Follow you where?
Why?
Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
I'd go over twelve percent for that.
I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away, I've just been dealin' with him.
Okay, let's go through what happened. We're in the place, everything's going fine. Then the alarm gets tripped. I turn around and all these cops are outside. You're right, it was like, bam! I blink my eyes are they're there. Everybody starts going apeshit. Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin' all the -
Look, enough of this "Mr White" shit -
Did ya see what happened to anybody else?
Nope.
No shit?
Assuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him? He's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which is making me nervous about being here. Even if Joe is on the up and up, he's probably not gonna be that happy with us. Joe planned a robbery, but he's got a blood bath on his hands now. Dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians... Jesus Christ! I tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight. If I was him, I'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible.
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
He got it in the belly. He's still alive, but won't be for long.
...Hey, I know what I'm talkin' about, black women ain't the same as white women.
What's the matter with her?
They won't be riding in the wagon.
Where do you keep the can opener?
I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.
But the rest is right.
I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.
You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?
I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.
I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.
Here's a man says he's looking for you girls.
What was he in jail for?
I've got eleven horses.
Where'd they go?
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
Oh... that's the time you went away.
I didn't stop to think, Clay.
All right, I hurt your feelings. But you know better than to go lightin' fires.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
You'll live.
She mustn't -- don't you let her --
What is it?
That sure smells good.
You're sure there's more where this came from?
Even women?
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
Goodbye and thanks.
You think that's all we busted -- You should see...
With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.
Go on. Have another try at him.
Clay Phillips.
I said let's go.
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
Then I know my alphabet.
An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?
That's always tough. How long were you together?
No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.
So, I guess I can go now.
He's right. I should go first.
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
Where the hell are we?
Look, what I'm trying to say --
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
Hey, look out, a bee!
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
So, do you think you made it into the class?
She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.
Professor, what's the history of this house?
Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned personality disorder. She seems guarded, but willing to do this.
That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
Car accident, gun shot, multiple stabbings, a hook through the back... Where did you find these kids?
Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.
I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
Alright... I might need your help.
You're not wearing a belt.
Father.
Yes.
"Ray!"
Bye, Mrs, Sutphin.
Mrs. Sutphin?
Here we go again.
 I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
Because it's the rules!
Oh God, really!  This is the limit!
Bye, Birdie.  Chip, honey... I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand... I'm your mother and I love you.
Tell me the truth, Mom! It's ok with me, really! Are you a serial killer?
We hope so, son. And no matter what your mother is, we'll love her anyway.
Goodnight, honey.
It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
I love that you're my wife.
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
What exactly does this sick individual say to you?
Just a half-a-cup.  Hello, Dottie. I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles...
And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up.  I'll take care of poor Rosemary!
Mrs. Hinkle... do you drink?
You got your wish.
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
Murder, honey.
What was that?
The name may not mean anything to you, young lady, but say the word and I'll have your sister for you in forty-eight hours.
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
When I wanted to.
May I have some water? I'm thirsty.
About forty-five dollars.
It's on Peary Street. Just ask the people who run it. They'll remember her.  People who see Miss Jacqueline never forget her.
Redi's all right.
You can't make it your life's work looking for Jacqueline.  ) You'll have to do other things... live...get some enjoyment out of life. I hope you'll let me help you.
This is about another murder —— a woman at Fifty Second Street
You told me you were pretty good with youngsters. Today I bumped into an old friend of mine, Mrs. Wheeler  She runs a settlement house down in the Village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher.
What brought you down here, Greg?
 What have you done about Irving August?
Don't. We know what happened. Don't go on.
I thought I might close up the apartment -- maybe get a place in Connecticut.
She'll have to know some time.
That's it. And this figure --she traced it. The book I saw at the library had been marked "perfect" by the library inspector in March. Mrs. Redi had it out in April. No one else had read it since.
It's not a searchlight —— it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince —- not stars --
If it is true — there's all the more reason for you to find Jacqueline.
See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.
This is curious, Jason. Half the time you talk as if Shakespeare were not fit to tie your shoe—laces; now this sudden humility.
Wait —- there is that other favor.
I'd hardly describe It that way —- The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
I have no intention whatsoever of hinting. Your sister, Mary, is a murderess. She killed Irving August -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.
Yes —— yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
That makes it all the more difficult ——
I'm worry to bother you. I want to ask you about my sister.
Miss Gibson, I'm tired of resting.
Children, I want you to be very good and very quiet while I see Mrs. Wheeler a moment. She's going to take over this class for a while.
It is a very real danger and one which forces our decision.
I have taken care of Mary. I've spoken to her. She's going back to school.
That was quick.
No, not really.
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?
So what about kids?
Why is that?
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
My therapist said that --
So you don't believe in therapy?
So since I've never had sex with you, by your own advice I shouldn't accept your advice.
Hi!
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
What are these?
It's a personal project I'm working on.
What about sex?
This is just... so...
That's a good question.
Tell me your name.
I don't see what difference it makes, I mean, I can think what I want.  I don't know if I want to do this anymore, I'm afraid... I don't mind answering the questions so much, but if somebody were to see this...
No.
Because that's how Cynthia thinks!! All she does is think about that stuff, and I hate that, I don't want to be like her, I don't want to be like her!!
So you do fantasize?
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
Subtlety?
But if you were?
Like maybe a big part?
Come on!!
I want to know why you are the way you are!
John?
Yes. I just got busy.
Why?
Goddam right.
Well, last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities, and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem.
But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.
What do you mean, like physically?
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
What are you talking about?
A card? For her fiftieth birthday?
Fine.
Because I never got around to it.
Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.
He just asked me questions.
He wouldn't do that.
I feel like I do.
He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
Here it is.
Do you have my work number?
Bye.
Well, why would she want a sun dress? She's got spots on her shoulders and varicose veins.
The extrovert.
I am now recording. Tell me your name.
Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
Hello.
I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
I would.
I have a friend coming in from out of town, I'll probably be spending some time with him the next couple of days.
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
Hello.
When?
Jesus, I don't know if I can get away. I've got a client waiting. I'd have to do some heavy duty juggling.
Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.
I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
Get rid of the car when you get your apartment, then you'll still have one key.
Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes.
Mr. Millaney?
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
C'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your father'll never miss it.
Anything wrong?
Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
Can I call you at the office?
Good shape for an old man, eh?
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
Yes?
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
GOT THE HOT FLUSH SYMPTOMS AND I'M FEELING FREAKY
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
How did you come by this scenario?
In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.
Of course, Mrs. Majors -- Janet -- But I'm puzzled.  If she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract?
McKinley?...McKinley?
President?  Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR COMPASSION
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR IMPROVEMENT
Oh, Harry.  What are we going to do?
They call it a new look at an old favourite I copied it from the 'Window on the World' show.  The Far East meets the Mid-West!
I'm...happy.
Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you.
Brad!
Our field.
HE LEAVES YOU SMOKING...
THAT MINIMAL
CRIMINAL
Bye.
You got it.
Hiya.
That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys.
Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
Don't open that now. It's warm.
Oh, that's tasty.
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
That's your problem, Miles.
You still seeing that shrink?
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
Doesn't mean shit. When Christine was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. Think it worked? Fuck no. How do you think I met her?
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall.
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
Stop it. You are blowing a great opportunity here, Miles. Fucking Maya, man. She's great. She's cool. She's funny. She knows wine. What is this morose come-down bullshit? These girls want to party. And what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come on!
And don't forget all the bad times you had with Victoria. How small she make you feel. That's why you had the affair in the first place.
Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
Does she know about Saturday?
Look who's talking. You've been there.
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
That's a public course.  No Stephanie?
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
What do you think's going on?
Been checking your messages?
I said okay?
You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
Do you like them?
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
Just write another one. You have lots of ideas, right?
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
Well?
That's thoughtful.
You know what I'm thinking?
I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type.
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
Yep. Quite a day.
Come on, let me drive.
What's wrong?
You broke some.
What are you drinking?
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
Hi.
She got anything good?
So what gems do you have in your collection?
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
Well...
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.
Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
Universally rejected. Strike three.
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
It was a surprise, Mom.
A hair.
See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.
I think it's contaminated.
I got the bat at home... On the wall.
Explain, act crazy?
Pharmacy crowded?
Do you think it's a possibility?
Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?
Merrill!
No.
It's still making the noises. It's broken.
They said one of two things could happen. One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later.
What about Isabelle?
Okay.  So he was tall?
Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions.
She's not in an ambulance Father.
Is that him?
If we charge them, they won't have a chance. But we gotta get to the horses.
Emmett! Am I glad to see you!
All I did was kiss a girl.
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
I didn't know you were out.
After the war my family worked a little piece of land near Savannah for a while. But the way it was down there then... well, they made it hard every way they could. Finally my daddy figured the promised land was out this direction. By that time I was so sick of farming, I didn't want to touch another hoe ever. I wouldn't come with 'em. My daddy took it pretty hard. Him, my ma, and my little sister headed out without me. They've got a little place south of Silverado. I guess they've done okay. Good enough anyway so that when my ma wrote me last time, she said they needed my help to work the place. That was almost nine months ago she wrote. Letter took a while to find me, but when it did, it was just the right time.
Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
I want you out of town before the hanging.
South of here, past Chimayo.
You'll have to deal me out on that. I've had some experience with that sort of thing, and I don't want any more.
What are you talking about?
You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
What's all this then?
Who's going to pay for all this, Sheriff?
Why come to me?
What's stopping you?
What makes you think I could?
I got there just short of too late.
Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.
Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job.
Easy, boy. Just an idea.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
Christ --  Elaine, I know how it looks but...  ... it would mean a lot to Viktor if you'd go with him to the Oscars. If you won't do it for him, please do it for me.
No!  You will not give in to that blackmailing bitch!
The picture's dead.
Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
Even the fall from the plane?
Viktor, do you realize you always do that?
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
I'm going to tell you a secret now, Elaine.  Simone is not a real person.  I invented her.
Can I see you later -- go away for the weekend?
I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?
God, it's so like your father.  Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?  I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence.  I can never forgive that.
You had no choice, Elaine.  He's a liability.
Obviously, this can't last.  She's going to dump him.  Viktor won't be able to take that.  He's too sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
Simone?
Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
-- Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky... thank God.  I've been trying to see you, calling -- Your assistant wouldn't put me through.  I told her it was a matter of life and death.  I was afraid I wouldn't get to you in time --
I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.
I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
Good and bad.  They think that's what caused this.  Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen.  It's the size of a grapefruit.  Heavy too.
-- We call them "vactors".
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
Your mother couldn't make it?
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
-- I know, I don't know anything.
Good-night, Daddy.
You know me -- married to my work.
She thinks you're with Simone.
-- I can't accept it.  I don't want a car, Dad.
-- Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.  It's the best deal you're going to get.
-- No!  I can't go along with this horseshit!  Just tell them they can fry me!
She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky.  Are you holding her hostage?  Are you some kind of Svengali?
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
Whatever it is, it's dark.
Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
It's a hotel.
Simone, are you there?
Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.
Goodnight, Malcolm.
You know that's probably not the best idea. I'll just wait to see them in the store.
I draw people with smiles, dogs running, and rainbows.  They don't have meetings about rainbows.
Where should I look then, Cole?
I walk this way to school with Tommy Tammisimo.
Think about what you want from our time together. What our goal should be?
That isn't magic.
I didn't know you were funny.
...No.
Yes?
I'm going to transfer you. I know two psychologists that are exceptional--
Don't cry.
You weren't a paper champion.
You have nice red in your cheeks now.
It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.'  Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?
Just help.
And you know what else?
I'd give anything to have been there.
You can see her?
Stuttering Stanley!
Good for you.
You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?
You have a strong unfufilled desire.
No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
Gene.
Thought your boy and his band were only staying the night.
Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"
Wrong. Fratricide is when you gun down your brother. You're out. My turn.
Damn! These are one hundred dollar Nikes!
Well, there goes our record deal.
I'll be gone again tomorrow.
You got it wrong, boy. I'm not the monster you think.
You'll be back.
Never heard of it.
What the fuck you talking about, man?
Asphyxiation. Choked to death on a ham sandwich. Next.
I almost thought for a second...
Hold it, hold it. Aren't you forgetting something, Rod?
-- Where have you two been?
Where's Mac?
Shit.
Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
Pretty, ain't they?
Maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
Rorschach.
Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town. Come pick us up.
Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?
Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on, baby, it's --
Who's that?
Praise Jesus.
You.
Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig.
You got my barley pop?
Why? You have a bowling date?
Christ, what channel are we on?...
The bus'll pick you up over there.  Uh... you got enough bread for a ticket?
Hey...
Jesus!!!
You know this guy, don't you?
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
I'm proud of you.
Kate...
What are you gonna do when you get home?
What can I say?
He's just exhausted.
I'm working, Bandit. Besides, what's the matter? Won't your new girl friend help you?
What are you doin' now?
He's history.
Let's get the hell outta here.
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff.
I'm Kate. You must be Cledus.
But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
Oh.
Five thou.
Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall- to-wall major felony offenses, murder, extortion, arson, grand larceny --  -- A paternity suit... I just feel like we're playing catch-up with all this and we shouldn't be.
You're sure?
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
You investigating those murders out at the lake?
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
I dunno... Cinnamon roll?
What the hell -- What is this!? People died. Agent Carruthers is dead!
Sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor. The son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice.
You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
The agents of that era are all dead and gone, history had defaulted to fable... until now. You can imagine the shock this sent through the corridors of power in D.C. Heller's op predates the second world war. That's over sixty years of intel. Do you know how valuable that could be? The man's a treasure trove.
...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...
Buzzy... Buzz...?
Alright, now Buzzy -- this is, this is it, here, okay, so listen to me careful and wait till I'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop.
For real?
You got the fifty up? Bitch y'tryin' t'take down a jumbo jet? Blown the moon out the sky? T'fuck you wanna get that grimy?
-- I don't know, I feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
And so I get this straight, we gotta go in, bust on this punk and remove the heart? Is that for real?
You'll end up like me.
I want to hear your version.
No.  There's no behavior modification.
You killed her!
Was her breakfast conversation that bad?
She has materialized from your memory of her.  What was her name?
Probably.
What are you going to report back to Earth?
Can you meet me and Sartorius on B deck in an hour?
If God is beyond our comprehension, and she --  -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?
Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable, how you equivocate!  You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen!  This is happening, Kelvin.  Wake up.
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
They come when you sleep.
Why do you think she hasn't suggested that?  It's the most obvious solution: Escape.  She knows she can't leave here --
She knows everything.  She knows who she is.
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up.  I was a threat.  Now I know why.  She was afraid she'd be seen.  That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right?  I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on.  I guess that's part of the reason why --
He has a point.
Was she right?
That won't happen again.  We're different.
I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.
No.
I think they help.
Where did you go before?
Gibarian was under enormous --
Occasionally.
Right.  That's true.
What did he say?
Hi.  Just checking to see if you're here.
You were reading my Renoir.
Stop being nuts!
Oh yeah.  When is it?  This thing in Queens.
They guys treatin' you all right?
You don't have to, now.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
Don't start... The only reason is that the neighborhood's shi...  ... crummy.  I just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.
She's got to identify him.
Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?
What?
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?
What was that?
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
I'm going to visit my sister for a few days.  I'd like you to get your stuff out.
Ellie...
He doesn't want to sleep here.  Neither do I.  It's not my house anymore.
I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike?
No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up!  He told me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone!  He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away!  Koontz, please!
What "plans?"  You and Mom got "plans?"
She's what?
Tommy!  The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't sing.
Time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
Here you go, Pete.
So, uh... how's college goin'?
Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--
You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
Hello, Liz.
You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
Of course.
I am old enough to--
Absolutely no class.
That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
Kid, you were terrific.  Max Reiss, novelty acts.  Was that judo or something?  Ah, skip it.  Question is, can you do it again?
... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
I asked if you felt like a drink--
Do you... live around here?
Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad.
Up here, Docky Ocky!
They never caught on.
Jawohl.
Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.
We made a deal with Barrack One.
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
Ready?
I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?
I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
How did he get over there?
The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished.
Then we're all in on it?
What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.
You have no idea how boring my life here is. If it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn't know what to do. I want to thank you for keeping me company. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't read. I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to lose you.
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
What do you do for heat in this barrack? No stove?
You were saying --?
Jawohl!
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
Thanks. You're a real pal!  What're we goin' to do with it?
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful! Married an orchestra leader!
Why don't we just look in those footlockers?
Do Grable.
There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?
Let me do it, Hoffy.
Sergeant Hoffman from Barrack 4.
What happened, Cookie? Who did it?
You'll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you.
Right.
Yeah?
So was the radio private property. So was Manfredi and Johnson.
Or how about a game of pinochle? No, you're not a pinochle man. You're a chess player.  I haven't played since I was a kid. Let's see --  -- a pawn moves this way, doesn't it? And a bishop this way? And the queen -- every which way, doesn't it?
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
Schulz, you're off your nut!
We have no radio.
Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Good morning, Sefton.
I'll make it five hundred!
You'd better talk, Schulz, because I'm going to find out with you or without you. Because I won't let go for a second. Because they'll have to kill me to stop me. So talk!
Hey, Schulz -- as long as you're going to move somebody in -- how about a couple of those Russian broads?
My grandmother's ear-muffs.
You must have been some tail gunner!  Go ahead, Cookie.
You heard him.
It's working.
But that wasn't so long ago. It couldn't have been more than...
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
This is its current position.
But at the first sign of trouble, I'm going to deactivate it. Agreed?
I get it. I get it.
What?
These are my children...my children.
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
I'm not going  Scotty, help me with this chute.
Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
That's a pretty big margin of error.
Captain, Im sorry.  I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.
The royal...studs?
Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team. Tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.
I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
Tractor beam, aye!
Nothing on my scanner, sir.
Aye sir, coding now.
It's okay -- I should have known you'd come... Saavik's right: this planet is unstable. It's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours.
My readings indicate great instability.
You mean, we're stranded down here?!
How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
Why?
This planet is aging in surges.
Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
Mr. Scott...
Mr. Scott?
Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --
My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me.
... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
Would you look at that?
May I ask why...?
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
I say again: Grissom, this is Enterprise. Admiral Kirk calling Captain Esteban or Lieutenant Saavik. Come in!
Give me your hand and we both live.
Ambassador, I -- I had no idea you were here...  I think you know my crew...
... Or the one.
We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
You amaze me, Commander.
Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
Well -- what are we going to do about it?!
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --
Shore leave, Admiral.
It never rains but when it pours --
Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm <u>still</u> in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis?
Do you have anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved.
Until now.
... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant --
I still don't under --
How can you let them pull that stuff on you? They're just lazy.
Come on, Mother, that's just the military mentality. Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. If there's one atom of life...
Will you please be quiet! We must have order here.  This has to be some sort of mistake.
Don't tell me you've got something.
It's the Genesis Wave!
We encoded four minutes --
I don't mean to intrude.
It was just words.
What are you looking at?
What are <u>you</u> looking at?
Well?
Genesis, what's that?
Midshipman, you're a tiger.
What's she doing here?
Admiral, they're reducing speed.
Sporadic energy readings port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn.
Very well.
I did not think so.
Khan!
On screen...
Indeterminate life signs.
Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?
Cease fire. Look sharp.
Time from my mark...
Yes, well, why don't you show him around and...
I can't get power, sir!
Mr. Sulu, lock phasers on target and await my command...
We commend the soul of our brother departed. We love we commit his body to the depths of space.
All moorings are clear, Captain.
Certainly...
Humans make illogical decisions...
I know. I feel the same thing. But we're between a rock and a hard place. We can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance.
And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
No!  No... What did you have in mind...?
I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
That's crazy!
An experimental device, doctor.
He's coming 'round, Jim...
Hi... Busy?
Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
You're saying... It is a compliment.
Fundoscopic examination --
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
Can you isolate the wave?
... It gives me a great sense of history.
Go ahead. Stun me.
Can you protect us?
You mean man...
Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!
Ohhh<u>kay</u>. I don't know what this is about, but I want you guys outta here right now or I call the cops.
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
We don't want to be any trouble.
They're gonna hafta take their chances.
You're upset about losing the whales.
Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
Where could you take them?
Here... In the park?
Steady, now. We need your help.
What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
You mean this is -- goodbye?
Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
Spock -- you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man?
Where are you going?!
Spock...?
You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
Admiral, may I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov.
Guidance is functional. Onboard Computer will interface with Federation memory bank...
Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
I have no control, sir!
Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.
Any luck...?
Bearing!
Admiral, I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees.
Scotty, how long is this bay?
They're giving out. De-crystallizing.
You better get up there, sir. We're having some power fall-off...
Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
Right on. You fly?
Father...?
Deceive us?
Don't panic...
Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
But you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time... or bedtimes... or having to eat food you don't like...
Chase me!
No... I want to stay with you...
Very funny...
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
Take us into a high orbit.  Lie down, Admiral. The girls will take twenty years off your face...
What kind of concerns?
In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
You're not finished here?
There are six hundred people down there. We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.  The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings...
I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
Aye, sir. Highly volatile...I recommend we keep our distance...
Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
Commander, I'm showing two Son'a ships on an intercept course.
Who is it?
Deck five.
Prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours.
There's a short letter I left you all, just some... sentimental nonsense... the computer will bring it to your attention at oh- four-hundred... I'd just as soon you delete it...
Would you like something to eat?
Captain...
Come out, come out wherever you are...
Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out...
You need a haircut, Commander.
Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...
We've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the Son'a.
Counselor?
Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
What are we waiting for? Let's go.
There must be some good people... even in this time.
You think they're still up there?
Is it Japanese?
The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones...
I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.
Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.
The vortex is collapsing, sir.
What year is it?
But now... they are all one with the Borg.
Did you know her?
No. Human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should I.
Picard to Enterprise.  Enterprise, please respond.
Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms...
Entering the upper ionospere...
The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.
Jean-Luc Picard.
From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
It can't wait until tomorrow...
Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.
Friends from Cornell...
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
Time travel... they're attempting time travel...  Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command!
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed...
Uh, Jim...
Three months till retirement. What a way to finish.
- <U>Kobayashi Maru</U>...
What kind of creature is this? Last night you two were spooning -
ARE YOU CRAZY?
Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen.  Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
We're explorers not diplomats!
This is fun...
Are you carrying a surgeon?
For 27 years I have been Ship's Surgeon and later Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. In three months I'm due to stand down.
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair, Captain James Tiberius Kirk. I put it to you, Captain, that you were seeking revenge for the death of your son.
You were demoted...
For insubordination.
Just the size of my head -
You're forgetting something.  the data banks say WE fired. If we did, the killers are here; if we didn't, whoever altered the data banks is here. Either way, what we're searching for is here...
You must have cursed yourself, for having programmed our data banks, Lieutenant. Only they revealed something wrong aboard Enterprise.
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Stand down your weapons.
This is incredible -
Aye, sir.
Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?
Just the prototype.
This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.
I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.
According to my information, today.
But we haven't run out of history just yet.  Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - "the undiscovered country"...
Channel open, Captain.
A lie?
In nineteenth century France, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines, flung their wooden shoes - called SABOTS - into the gears to stop them. Hence the word SABOTAGE.
We can send a message to Starfleet Command -
NO WAY!
They don't place the same value on life that we do, Spock - you know that... take my word: she didn't shed one bloody tear...
Twenty-four hours from now we won't have a clue where the Captain is.
They dinna fire on themselves. And there were no other ships present.
They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.
I don't think Starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament.
Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it "Plasma" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.
Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
Brother. I cannot move.
Beverly, come in.
Jean Luc, Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else.
How long does he have?
And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
The choices I made have led me here as well. This is the only home I have ever known. I cannot foresee a reason for leaving.
To new worlds...
The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction, sir.
He is very observant.
Data!
Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing.
Ready, Captain.
"For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror.
It appears to be...  ... an arm.
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
But how can he? He'll kill you.
No.
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.
It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
You have the bridge, Commander. Use all available power to move away from the Scimitar.  Now, Mister La Forge.
Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors.
 Believe me, we don't under- stand it either. You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.

Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear...  Naked.
I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.
To find the head, sir?
What's this?
Captain, you have an Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command.
Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols  -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here, we are.
He wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span.
The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.
But she's not the Enterprise.
Anything.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
It's not quite the face you remember.
For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals.
Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
Intruder alert!
It's accelerating. You have no more time for games.
How long until we reach the Rift?
How many Warbirds will you need?
Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they'll follow you.
But surely...
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
What did I tell you?
Mike, call for back-up.  Benny, you all right?
None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...
Hello George.
We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.
Then you're going to have to do it without me.
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?
Steering wheel.
What?
Minneapolis... good.
Go.
Closed?
Who are you?
Are you from up there? Space?
Horses.
When do you have to be here?
Sun...
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
Yes.
Eh... yes...
Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak English.'
Goodbye.
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
You thought we were a different planet?!
The captain...
It's bad.
I told you goodbye. Why are you here?
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...
They after you?
Wait. Could I have your autograph?
I'm telling you they're probably friendly.
You have no conception of this, do you?
No, sir. Radar.
After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive.
Oh, Jesus.
Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
Yeah, that's right.
Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead.
Jesus.
Look, baby, it's now of never... the guy is a known input junkie, so a little OD won't surprise anybody. It's the only way we can be together.  You know it's true.
You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--'
Cut it out, Tran.
Hi, baby.  I've missed you.
You talked to Iris?  When?
Look, baby, I've watched you create yourself out of nothing.  You're like a goddamn cruise missile, targeted on making it.  And you will.
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
You think Tran killed her?
Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
Clips.
Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
So lay it off to somebody else.
Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all...
I always do.
Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is Armani.  You angry?
That would be no.
Jesus, Lenny.
She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.
You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
No it doesn't.
Those two guys were cops.
Uh unh.  I won't do it.
So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny.
There's a plus side?
Okay, we gotta get over there.  Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--
Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?
Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?
The family has gone through a lot. Their daughter missing, the search, her body found, the funeral -- then this order to exhume the corpse.
A grill pattern.
You... surprised me.
Yeah.
What are you...?
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
How did you know he was a construction worker?
Speck's the killer all right. We got box loads of evidence. Did 'em all the same way: torture, strangulation. Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count.
Nada. Vague description, that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car, the diner: no fingerprints, no trace evidence.
Mackelway, I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you.
You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?
Thanks for the ride.
You work with Koessler?
What about the chat rooms themselves?
Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?
There are Agency regulations about this.
I've been thinking about this.
The tattoo?
You mean --
Did they disconnect Testa's computer?
You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.
I met with Richard Low.  These are names of missing persons he has flagged. I'm double-checking every case, but I don't want to be too obvious about it. I marked the ones I'd like you to work on.
Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.
I'd be real careful if I were you.
You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
Mack must think Zero has a police band.
How did you know Speck was a killer?
Agent Mackelway?
He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
Suspect Zero?
So you went underground?
[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
I want to help you.
Thomas Mackelway.
I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?
This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.
Koessler?
How far is Amarillo?
You've been through worse.
How are you ladies doing this evening?
I'm sorry?
Are you sure? Maybe...
What else?
Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.
Charles! What's up, man?
...not until you book it...
You haven't told then, huh?
Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you.
No... no... The worst was when I went in for this After-School special and I'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. I see they're all signed in for the same role as me...
Let me just check on my boy.
Huh?
Do you have anything smaller?
Do you ever perform out here? I'd love to see you.
Who's your booking agent?
Sorry, it's just that...
You said there are advantages to being single. I want to know what the advantages are.
Can I give you a ride to your car...?
Yeah, hold on.
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
And what if I don't want to give up on her?
But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her.
I don't think I'm gonna take it.
There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
Haven't you noticed I didn't mention Michelle once today?
What? Like, you didn't want to jinx it?
I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
I think I'm gonna move Back East.
Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...
...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Don't call me ever again.
That's right.
That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
I took out three hundred, but I'm only gonna bet with one. I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night. You gotta be cool though.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...
...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...
Baby, you did fine.
...Baby...
Wait...  She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like "Wait a second". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy.
That was different.
I hear she's getting real fat.
...the Copa, in New York...
What are you doing?
You looked right at her, baby.
We got the digits, baby.
Is he cute? Ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail!
Now?
Yes she did.
...and you got big claws and fangs...
You're money.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
But your daughter is still alive.
What do you wish me to do?
The food is on the table.
Eat it, it's on the table.
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun.  I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.
All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work.
Is it necessary?
He's his own boss, and very competent.
This morning.
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
Tom, I never thought you were a bad Consigliere, I thought Santino a bad Don, rest in peace.  He had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune.  Michael has all my confidence, as you do.  For reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen.
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
Godfather, you understand everything.
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
What is it?
We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
Get the car.  I'll be leaving in ten minutes.  Where's Calo?
You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight. 
Beautiful all over, eh?
Mike!  The party starting!
Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him.
Is the hospital covered?
Has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies?
One of Tattaglia's people?
Michael, what are those men doing?
They're talking to themselves.
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
I never know when you're telling me the truth.
Michael.
Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.
I don't think so either.  I better go.
I have to see my father and his people when we get back to the Mall.
We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets.
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me.
I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father.  What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.
Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
Where are you going?
We can't wait.  No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop.  You have to get Sollozzo now.
Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it.  Pretty soon there won't be one place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
Mike, good to see you.  Got everything you want?
Buy me out?...
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
I'll come down.
It'll just be for a little while. He can be... he makes me laugh.
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
He's drowning me!
Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back?
I have to go to Venice.
Do you have any brothers?
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?
He's downstairs.
What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
Esatto. I'm always planning.
Why?
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.
Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.
I guess.
Could you ever conceive of going to Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home?  I'd pay you. I'd pay you 1000 dollars.
Mr Greenleaf.
Pretty good. Sticking with hot water.
You really should go in, it's marvelous.
Are you okay?
Hello Marge.
I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
He hates being confronted.
What?
Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
It's all true.
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
So you found Peter...
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.
Of course. Aunt Joan.
Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him.
My God.
In Rome, about three weeks ago.  I knew that one.
Tell him I have a fiancée, Dickie has a fiancée and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.
What did he say?
I keep wanting to do that -- fling open the door -- let the light in, clean everything out. If I could get a huge eraser and rub everything out... starting with myself... the thing is, Peter, if...
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.
Dickie Greenleaf?
So Signor Miles drove away and you did what?
Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome.
Can we go up? Do you mind?
A few days ago.
Absolutely.
Is that so?  But what do you think of Charles Palantine?
Why?
Really?
Huh?
The DMZ?
What hours do you work?
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
You know what you remind me of?
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead?
What taxi driver?
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
No, why?
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
Well, if there's this many hackies inside, there must be lots of fares outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em.
Where.
Where?
I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs.
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
Why?
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
What should I do? Call the cops?
How?
You don't have to.
Why should it be grounded?
Got your license?
So why do you want to be a taxi driver?
There's porno theatres for that.
You kiddin? Who else would hack through South Bronx or Harlem at night?
Some. Here and there.
No.
Who?
Look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.
Get it.
What's the action around?
What do you expect, Bertrand Russell? I've been a cabbie all my life, what do I know?  I don't even know what you're talking about.
Stick with Carla.
Maybe.  Not really.
Partners?
You knew?  All this time?
St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas.  Front pew.  Right leg. = Hollow.
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
You've got everything?
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
What.
I do?
I'm sorry.
Were we going to get married?
Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things?
Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment.  I wonder if you're familiar with it.
Cecil!  Cecil, there's a young man in there...
Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
We've been closed for a while.
That's Lily.  Your mother, rest her soul.
I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened.  And you'll get one, too.
Yes?
But I...
I'll be home in a little while, Harry.  Don't wait up.
Beautiful, wasn't it?
Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.
Zackly.
Been drinkin' a bit, have we?
Here, one of mine.
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
You smell gas?
You should watch what you say.
Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
The FBI can't arrest you, because you haven't done anything wrong.
Next time, it might be the FBI. The time after that, it might be the President.  But it'll always be someone.  Count on it.
I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.
I can play the piano?
Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?
Miss Daniels? Is that you?
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
Yes, I did.
Miss Daniels?
They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.
Are you coming to my party?
Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The birds.
Why are they trying to kill people?
The little girl's name.
Yes.
Thank you.
I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
In a bird shop.
But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...
Yes?
Mitch...
If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
No.
Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do.  I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man.  But...  You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone.  I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset.  I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.
I couldn't ask you to.
That's the last of it.
Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know.
Oh, yeah, yeah.  How old is she now?
Does this room look silly?
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
I didn't break that window!
What's that?
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
Why... 
But you were coming up anyway, remember?
Yes, but...
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
And you didn't come up here to see her.
But not for me.
I have several jobs.
Last night? What do you mean?
Of birds?
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
What it was, probably...
They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.
Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week.
Have we still got power?
Where are they heading?
What time is it?
You must be exhausted.
Can we turn back?
Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
For what purpose?
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?
We need them.
How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish.
I didn't mean it that way.  I meant only that I am not in a position to ask favors.
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --
Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
Dr. MacFarlane --
You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
It was about last night I wanted to talk to you -- about the operation on the little Marsh girl.
But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
We can't be sure of that.
I don't know that -- neither do you.  This subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --
I suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor.
I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows.  We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.
Why do you want the white horse to bid you "good-day"?
I'll not do it, Gray.
You know something about the human body, Gray.
This is a gift you'll not return.
I would make you rich.
You're welcome to my little nest, Joseph -- is it not? That's right -- you have something to say to  me -- something very private.
I have made you give me money, but you smile. Aren't you angry?
You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
Child seems to take to the lad. What sort of an accident was it, Ma'am?
I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
Nonsense.  You're a fey creature with mad ideas.  But you have a wildness that holds me to you, lass.
Fettes -- where is Fettes?
You're not going to Gray.
It was one thing her dad rejected you. But when she did you lost it.
You think I'm crazy.
Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
The scar. Which of you has it?
And he's right over there by the way.  What did you do to your face?
I know who you are.  That's why you paint your face. To hide.
I've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. But what you're doing now, does. I don't know why.
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
It's ok, it's ok...
Guy dressed for Halloween?
Anything wrong?
Why are there so many?
I want to take this to Lauren. She'd want it.
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
Are you ok?
Stay away from me! Stay away!
They killed her because she found out.
Please. Come inside.
The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have.
You have faith, Professor Barnhardt
In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.
It is not enough to have men of science. We scientists are too easily ignored -- or misunderstood. We must get important men from every field. Educators -- philosophers -- church leaders -- men of vision and imagination -- the finest minds in the world.
One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
Maybe a little demonstration.
Did you have a nice day, dear?
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
Tell me what?
You think they'll ever find him?
Did all these people die in wars?
I've got some money. My mother gave me two dollars.
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.
I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--
Your impatience is quite understandable.
I've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr. Carpenter.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
I don't know how to thank you.
Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
Mr. Carpenter, I--  Goodnight.
Oh -- hello--
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
"Klaatu barada nikto."
No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.
Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
Is it worth anything?
Your name's Carpenter -- that right?  Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
May I suggest that you call the Professor?
I don't like horror comics.
I don't like horror comics.
All together?
Should I run him through?
We are awesome monster-bashers!
We were gonna grab some food.
With him?
This is just our cover.  We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
I wish they were vampires so I could nuke them in their hearts.
He's not glowing.
I thought they'd be in coffins.
Of course not!
Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck.  What's all that wood in there for?
Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
I know it was them, Star.  I'm sure of it.  He was working in the yard -- hammering something.  The yard was big with lots of grass.  There was no boardwalk and no ocean.  She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair.  I was there, too.  And a dog -- but I don't know its name.  I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog.  They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing.  And I was laughing, too.
You didn't tell David?
Michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  Will you stay home with Sam tonight?  I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
Ocean air!
When you ran away from home, hitch- hiked to Berkeley, spent the night in Golden Gate Park and begged for spare change in the morning?
Where's Michael?
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
You've got a generous nature.  I like that in a person.  My name is Max.
I'm really sorry, Max.
He doesn't walk all over me.
Max... what are you talking about?
How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
Now you and David...
Then it's not too late for us...
I know, I've felt it...
What!?  He <u>can</u> and I <u>can't</u>?!  No fair!!
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
Go away.
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
All right... Box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol.
I've changed my mind... I'd... I'd like to come back inside... I don't want to stay out here any more... Funny things... I hear funny things out here.
Somebody broke in.
Childs!!
Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
Torch them!!
MacReady!
We found your clothes -- the ones you tried to burn.
... Ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up...
And if anyone tries to wake me...
I guess you're okay.
How long will it take you to prepare this?
Can there be... some kind of test? To find out who's what?
After all this mess then.
Looks good.
... Hey, somebody!  Open up, it's me, MacReady...  ... Come on, damn it... The towline snapped.  Been crawling around like a seal out here...
It's got into the pub!  It's turned on the stereo!
She didn't want me to be a climber. She wanted me to be a planner like her.
I think we should go on by ourselves.
Please, just listen to me... Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt.  I'll find her.
... Well, you wanted to see it.
So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you?  See all the mysteries exposed?
When was his mother taken?
Machines?
Why did they built it?
This has to end.
Vox --
Nothing to do, I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end, though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?
Now get out of my sight, you hideous primate.
Say I just come back again?
Why?
You took her because she helped me.
May I help you?
Dance with me...
My God...
I was not.
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
Alex, really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you.
I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
I can't do that --
You're up!  You must be feeling better --
How long did you travel?
Is there a lot of illness?
It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.
I'm going to sit with Kalen.  Keep the fire burning if you can.
Mara, I had a strange dream last night.  I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then...
You share dreams?  That's incredible.
And this is your "work"?
It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
... It was a great city.  The greatest city in the world.
Oh very.  Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.
Yes.
You've welcomed me into your home. Into your lives.  Everyone has... For the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much.  I thank you for that.
It was different then.
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
Yes, sir.
Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
We have to go after them, find where -- !
What do you mean?!
We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
Long live the Organization for the Organized!
It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year.
Yes.
Becker, how do you sleep at night?
Who are you?
I don't know how you died. The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer...
My father used to talk about you.
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
You done with your small talk?
You're just gonna walk?
William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
They're not here.
[Beat] You be good to yourself, Jackie.
Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.
Why, what would you do?
Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?
Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?
Why don't you help me?
Why not?
Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true.
Can I get some paper and something to write with.
You know how to get there?
I tried to kill my wife.
MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are crazy?
No.
[Beat] Why'd you stop?
Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that!  Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning.
Hon.
You want anything special for dinner?
'Bye, honey.  I won't wait up.
... only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night.
Darryl.
On what?
Who's the nut?
You're gettin' in deeper every moment you're gone.
I have no problem with that.
What kind of gun was it?
We're going to leave someone here at the house in the event that she calls in.  Someone will be here until we find them.
Now, for one thing, you violated your parole two days out.  And you know Judge Hainey.  He hates this sort of thing.  Once he gets wind of this, he's gonna blow sky high.  And then when he finds out that you're a possible accessory to murder and armed robbery, well, I think we can safely place your ass back in the slammer for at least the remaining eight, don't you?
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
This is J.D.  He's a student.  We're just givin' him a ride to... to here.  Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go. And that's what he's doin'.  He's goin'.  Aren't you, J.D.?
I am the great and powerful Oz...
No, I mean how would you do it?  Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
Tell me.
You're kinda the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.
Are you just doin' this to punish me?
You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please.
Whose place is this again?
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm hungry.
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
We're gonna go to the next town and stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  We're gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you?
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
Will I be?
I'm sorry.  Well, we need the money. Now we have it.
Ugh!!  Why do they have to do that?
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
I mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse.  I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it.
What?
What?!
I'm warning you, Thelma.  You better drop it right now!  I don't want to talk about it!
What do we do?  What do you want to do?!
I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.
And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either.  It's burning a hole in my stomach.
You do?
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  I mean, I just wanna know.
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
No.
Me too.  I feel awake.
Hey.  Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
Isn't it beautiful?!!
We been seein' you all along the way.
You women are crazy!
No harm, no foul?
Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.
His mother?
That's it, I'm making an oath. I'll never procrastinate about anything again. Life is too fucking short.
Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health...  I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment.
My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
Check.
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
Stalker, huh?
Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
Hello...? Sully...?  Sully, that you?
The sawbones?
I'm just saying I don't mind a guy with a bit of a beer belly. It means he's a guy. You can have those pretty boys who hang out in a gym all day staring at their reflections.
Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.
By the way, what's your name?
Lint?
No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.
Are you okay?
No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I say none of us leave this room until our young Mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants. Now Mary, I know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us.
So, Dom tells me you're looking for some lady-friend you knew in high school.
All you want is a phone number?
Don't play games with me, Ted.
Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
Thanks, Healy. Good work.
What are you doing?
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
You bet.
Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid.
You what?
I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else.  My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.
...So then in '94 I went back to Dade Community College for a semester and when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I hooked up with the Pizza Barn.
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
I can live with those reflections.
What's he like?
The point is, love isn't about money or social standing or age, it's about connecting with someone, having things in common kindred spirits.
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
Pat does projects all over the world.
What's up?
What...?
Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.
So who you taking to the prom?
The prom -- you going?
Are you all right?
Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be okay?
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
...and then it was all over.  We haven't spoken since.
Um, Ted, I need a moment with Magda -- would you let the dog out of the bathroom.
That you put a murderer on my trail?
What what are you doing here?
It.
Eh.
How are you doing, Warren?
This was not the President's intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets don't see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just did?  There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral?
Jesus Christ, guys. What the hell's Khruschev thinking?
Goddamn Stevenson. Jesus. Peace at any price. You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two.
We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
He gets it, but he's pissed.
My father --
Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
What did you think of Lippman's column this morning?
That is correct.
Max.
Does this attack on our plane represent a definitive, intentional escalation on the part of the Soviets?
It's Tuesday. You said to call. When do I get my 45 minutes?
I don't like what's happening.
How does a man get to a place where he can say, 'throw those lives away,' so easily?
Dangle a settlement, tie us down in negotiations, we come up short...
Hey.
Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.
Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples.
Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --
Those are two agents who went into a reservation a few years ago to serve a warrant. They were executed at close range. That one there is a police officer killed by the Mohawks up in Canada more recently.
Were you in Nam?
Hey, hey, hey. J. Edgar would've loved you. He'd love anybody who joined the bureau to, what was it? "To enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests"?
Water. Worth killing for out here, I'd think.
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
Ray...
I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.
You're an easy man to track, Ray. Ya walk like a penguin with a hard-on.
What's he smoke in that?
You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
Do they come in dreams, these visions?
You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty.
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
Bullshit. You had a vision. You got sign from the old ones.
What's that?
Ain't no Council Fire, Brother. Clear Moon...
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
Grandpa Reaches says you come from heavy Indian blood. I used to think Grandpa was gettin' senile. Now I know he is.
Your relatives must've taught you something.
X22. Read.
What the fuck, man? What do you people want? I did what you wasi'cu's told me to do.
No way. No fuckin' way.
The men who came to see you at Leavenworth. The one's who made the arrangement... who were they? Maybe I can talk to them.
I beg your pardon.
Two.
You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference?
Lieutenant...
What if he's not?
What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
Doesn't it ever bother you?
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
You don't believe that.
What kind of games?
Want to play the game?
You didn't mean it. You didn't think. You'd do anything to take it back.
Looks like a tie.
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
Lieutenant... Is there... a Russian attack?
Sir?
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
I'm pulling up.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! FLARES!
Is it you?
You're not supposed to...
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
Let me do the talking.
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
Tom Kazansky.
Ahhh...A little high on the left, don't you think?
He's the best you have. He's going Top Gun!
Well, he's going  and he needs someone to fly the plane.
Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party?
GET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE UNSAFE. GET OUT OF THERE.
IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
OKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH.
The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
You won?!!!
Morning, Coogan.
I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
How do you feel?
It's no disgrace, kid. That spin was hell. It would wreck anyone's confidence. You could be a good pilot again someday...
Well, there it is; the Last Resort.  Sure you wanna go in?
Lemme ask you a question.  Ever fuck a mutant?
The guy's a fucking asshole.
I didn't want it to end this way.  I wanted Hauser back.  But nooo.  You had to be Quaid.
He had help.  From our side, sir.
Now let's get down to business.  Kuato wants what's in Quaid's head.  And he might be able to get it, cause they say he's psychic.  Now I have a little plan to keep this from happening.  --Do you think you can play along?
Stop fighting and get out.
Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall.
Good evening...  Doug.  I'm Dr. Lull.
Two-headed monsters?
So, been married long?
What do you want?
Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
Richter!  Call from Cohaagen.
If we don't hand you over, everybody in the sector'll be dead by morning.
I don't know.  Maybe.
Why not?
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
Where?
Shit!
That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
I've got a lock!  There!
Look at this shit.
Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?
Would you please repeat the destination?
Who is she?
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
And you believe him?
I give up.
I'm not interested in that.
They'll be here any minute!  They'll kill you all!
I love you.
I don't remember you.
What can I do?
What reactor?!
Cohaagen knows it makes air.  But the bastard won't turn it on.
...Who are you?
You guys all set?
Knock it off, Burt!
She's got my vote.
I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.
Oh my God.
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year.
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
Probably up a pole starving itself to death.
Son of a bitch!
You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here.
Shut it up!  Shut the little bastard up!
How the hell long it take <u>you</u> to change a tire?
Its tires are flat...
<u>People</u>?  Hell, <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.
Yeah...but no ties.
Come on.  Get away from it!
Hey Val, listen.  Bearing going out, you think?
Hi, I'm Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck. I'm up here for the semester...
Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
Isn't there a ten to fifteen-percent margin of error?
I move that the witness's testimony be stricken. He has clearly been terrorized by the prosecution, he's --
What, "everything"? You shot a corpse. I don't give a shit about that -- !
Haven't heard that one before, Ed.  But I guess I'll be hearing it again.
You can't remember that -- !
Exactly what information led you to arrest my client just two-and-a-half hours after the shooting took place?
Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
Kim got busted at 19 for burglary. At 20 he was convicted in the shooting death of a young Chinese gang lord... The prosecution claimed Kim did it to get into "the Joe Boys"?
When did you start working for the goddam D.A.?
Shoulda told the one about Shu being the bastard child of Mother Theresa.
His name is Chuckie Roeder. But something's very weird.
They're just frightened, fucked-up losers that prison fucked up worse.
So an upstanding member of the Aryan Warriors wouldn't paint them on. They take those teardrops seriously -- they're badges of courage, of honor. Only their most vicious killer elite get to wear them...!
Goddam it... the little punk bests me again, I get thrown down and lectured at and where the hell were you?
So what're we gonna do?
They could've been brothers. It's why the eyewitnesses picked Shu.
"The killer wasn't Chinese"... Cecil Stipe was right. .!
Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
Start looking into the Joe Boys -- who assigned the hits in 1980, what rank generally did the hits...  Your extensive law enforcement contacts should be of some use.
I haven't thanked you for your work, Kitty. You're doing good work.
My mother find you?
But why?
-- About what?
What went down?
...I'm dying out there.
Quite a bit you didn't tell me.
You won't remember this, but in '72 I was one of several prosecutors assigned to the Black Panther-Police Shootout.  We had a whole team, and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt.  So what've you been up to since then?
I see: He'd walk out next month.
You're pissing me off again, Ed.
Isn't it a standard trick to pack a line-up with men who resemble each other but look different than the suspect, so the suspect will stand out for the eyewitnesses?
You don't speak any Chinese dialects? Then you get your intelligence from snitches?
Isn't it true that without Esparza, you had no investigation?
You getting this?
Mr. Ortega, you've known the defendant at Ossining Correctional for how long?
Five years.
Mr. Ortega, what is Shu Kai Kim's rank within La Compania?
Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
I'm nearly out.
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
Don't get funny with me again.
That's not the way to Cliff's trailer. I told you.
Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks was killed. I'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.
Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.
I cracked the Whiteman case with this.
And no one found the ring?
Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
He's with me.  Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?
Lil was wearing a sour face.
A blue rose.
What did Gordon's tie mean?
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
Solved the Whiteman Case with this.
Crushed skull. Probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object. Subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age.
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
One thing that has been troubling me. That lamp at the diner. Do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
Noooo...
Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
Oh god, Laura.
Maybe I better start our homework.
I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
Goodbye, Muffin.
Where are the Cookies?
If I had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, I'd be dead.
What are you doing?
I won't wear your stuff.  I promise.
You're not mad at me?
How did the car get back here?
Why do you do it, Laura?
What'll it be?
Even this heavy work beats being at home with the old ball and chain.
The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.
That's right. She called me. She even asked me what your fathers looked like...
No.
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
Laura, now I can't find that blue sweater. Did you take it again?
I hate asparagus.
Laura. What's wrong this morning?
Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner.
Come back as soon as you can.
What did he find?
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
Four cases in three years...
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
This is going to drive the ante up.
They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
You would not...?
Neurology?
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
Objection! This is ri... expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.  It's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
Say it.
Thank you. When Debby...
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear. Isn't that what you did?
Please sit down. I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here. I've got a case coming in two days in the Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are?  Who do you think you are...?
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
...apartment.  No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
I... in that small context I would have... I would have to say 'no.'
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
She getting good care over there?
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.' General textbook on the subject. Is that correct?
Yes.
Do you know who her doctors were?
The most respected...
Hi.
Who told you that?
I used to be a nurse.
I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
I need an extension for my case.
I had a witness disappear on me.
Listen to me, fella...
Galvin, look, many years ago...
I object, your Honor...
I'm a lawyer.
Really. How wonderful for you.
A brick house says you divorced him. I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner. And I'll take your word for it. Now you tell me the truth. Because you cannot lie to me. What's your name?
I've got to work...
Not if you don't grow up...
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
Yes, we know that you do. I have it in my files. That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
...we, we love her, Dick and me...
I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will...
Are we going to win?  We have, you know, other tactics, though...
I want to buy you a drink.
Well, well, well. Huh?
...hey, I don't need your charity...
Come on. Let's get a drink.
Mick. Mick. Mick...
...he's a good man...
Been a long time, huh...?
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
What the hell are you doing here?
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.  The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.  She wanted to move to Boston.  How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.  Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
Hey, you!  Better get outa here!
Aw, he isn't that good...!
The troops are certainly moving in here!
I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
Is that... machine...?
Where are we?
I almost forget when I ate last.  It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.
Nothing there now.
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
What is that gizmo?!
A forlorn hope - but there is a chance.
I got a message for you.  You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?
Better'n a lion farm or a snake pit. We won't have to feed it!
What'll we say to 'em?
The nightmares.
Might as well be, Dylan.  State of the art animatronics enhanced with bio- organic grafting.  Bull tendons, nerve bundles from a Doberman, even half the brain of a homicidal primate was...
Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
No, you don't.
Any history of epilepsy in your family?
You going away?
Okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep tight.
Dylan, you go back to sleep now.
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
Everything went great, I thought.  We really got you, didn't we?
Darker.  More...evil?
You didn't jump in.
I've never mentioned it to him.
Heather, what is it?
No, I don't think that at all.  How is he?
Then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?
You saying Freddy's this ancient thing?
Yes?
He would have loved this.
Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars?
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg, Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart: scrape and paint.  Corry and Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson, you're the Galley slave.  March you're on chain gang with Barnes. Johnston, solo on bilge detail.
It didn't go over 'til I turned her starboard!
Make us proud.
Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
She isn't that old.
I've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life.  It's what they expect. After all this, I still haven't figured it out.
Why then.
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
You only hurt yourself you know?
Can we talk?
But that's not the point...
Do you have your ticket?
Goodbye Mom.  I'll be okay.
Jesus.
No way!
My parents don't do it anymore.
Where are you from any way?
My brother.  He fell out of the old beech tree.  Broke his neck.  I was on a camp out.  They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down...  They didn't find him 'till the next morning.  They didn't even know why he was up there.
I can't go in there.
Northeast sir!
Remember something, sooner or later... we all have to face it.
Of a fight he can't win out here.
I mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is.  What right did then have to show up here?
Albatross?  Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
Spying?!
Oh, really?
Hell, they even kicked me outa vo- tech 'cause I couldn't read a slide rule.
Me, too.
I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.
What?  Come on...
Why, man?
What's wrong Mr. Lawford.
What do you think?
No way Phil.  Not like this.
You're a day late.  We keep a schedule aboard ship.  Lives depend on it.  Hello, Philip.
Suicidal...
No, sir.
I'm not gonna kill it.
Swing up, son.
What are you blubbering about?
The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.
Everybody knows why she went over Tod.  You jibed the boat.
Can't all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo prob'ly wouldn'ta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadn't kicked his ass out.
I'd just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one, if it's same to you.
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.
Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
I don't particularly care for that kind of talk, Bobby.
Ain't never had no girl pull a blade on me.
Gas?
Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.
You hitched yet?
I thought you two were in Austin, Texas. Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts.
That is my permiso.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's authorized to carry a .45.
If your neighbors didn't mind, how'd you get put out of business?
The Good Witch...
The same to you. If you are in Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and visit us. The Hondurans are great friends of the American people. But I have a joke for you before I go. If a liberal, a socialist, and a communist all jumped off the roof of the Empire State Building at the same time, which one of them would hit the ground first?
Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local shrimp boat captains is in jail now. These people are friends of mine, so I must return and find out what happened.
Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland?
Gotta admit, you guys are -  two in four dozen.
I forgot to show you this. The gentlemen that gave this to me said you'd recognize it. Said he wanted it'd be 'bout the last thing you ever saw in this life.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
I got some news, Marietta. Lula and Sailor been here. They checked out of the Hotel Brazil on Frechman Street yesterday.
I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.
I did, honey, but that was last night... Let's just find those two kids before it's too late.
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
What you want to watch this trash for? Ain't one of those people have a real thought in their brain.
I'm sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments where all you been the last two years.
I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.
That don't smell like a More.
You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.
How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.
I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads. They don't hardly never get washed, and I don't like the idea of lyin' on other people's dirt.
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.
How much we got left, honey?
What's that, peanut?
God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.
I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...
Sailor, what are we gonna do?
Not bad for eleven dollars a day.
Really, Sailor, it ain't nothin' against you. I love you.
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
I mean tomorrow.
You must be my son.
LULA!!!!
Mama???
If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.
Mama, I'm hangin' up this phone now.
Lula? I love you, baby. I just want you to be all right.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
I know... I remember.
I ain't heard of nothin'.
What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.
That's just how my brain works, I guess.
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
Mm.
He said something about being between things.
He has a book.
What's this guy's problem?
Shit.
You stay there.
Good God. Let's go rescue him.
So modest.
Is he awake?
Shut up, James.
The hood jumper?
Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
You peeked, didn't you?
How are you -- is it Joe?
You driving this car?
No. There's no one here.
Sure.
Hello?
...reconcile with Emily.
It's just... for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet...
So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
Well...
James.  Don't leave just yet. There's something I think you ought to see.
Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle.  Have one.
Oh.
He didn't give his name.
Afraid so.
Washed up?
Professor Tripp?
I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me.
Humboldt County?
Carvel.
When we fall, we fall hard.
I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions.
The one that left you?
Maybe she didn't come here.
It feels really... good... here.
Let me spell it out for you, James. Books don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not anymore.
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
What would you call them then?
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
Does she mean -- does she know about... her dog?
But where? I need the street.
I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.
Professor Tripp.
I got the message you called.
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
Emily left me this morning.
Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.
You had another one, didn't you? You have to see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday morning. All right?
Well...
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
I'm kidding. Hello?
I believe you. I believe you want to be with me. But this is not just about me anymore.
Oh?
I'm so glad to see you, Sara.
He's writing his name in water.
Who's this ?
Say, Professor Tripp, is all that stuff true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last longer?
Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub all kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb.
Who's that guy?
Where you stand?
I -- just wanted to see her, I guess -- Emily. And to see you too -- you and Irene. And to let everyone know that, even though it may be difficult to comprehend now, this -- everything that's happening -- it's not forever. It doesn't mean "Goodbye."
We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.
No, the dog.
Are you riding with me, James?
Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth, 1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an accident, but, you know...  He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took pills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more pills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget when. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot himself. Jean Seberg, pills of course, 1979. Everett Sioane -- he was good -- pills. Margaret Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills. Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in 1978. There are more but I don't know if you would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia?
But maybe it's not so healthy being so close, you know, to a school.
Annette? She's good... tense.
I remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor Annette married." Except her brother. You treated me with respect.  Look, you paid your dues. Your slate is clean now.
What are you doing?
It's my own design. You won't find another table like it in the world.
Fucking Mariners.
The important thing is that you and Annette need to talk. She needs to see you, and you need to see her.
You always carry these?
It's just a city park.
My daddy likes me home before dark.
Hiya, Walter.
The one with the ax?
You knew her?
I didn't say what time the assault occurred.
That's a nasty scratch on your neck.
What?
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
But will he... ?
Walter?
Do I take "okay" to mean you feel good about working there?
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.
Then why are you talking about this?
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
Is that what you are angry about?
Will I ever be normal?
How do you define it?
Then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
I'd like you to close your eyes.
I'm only asking questions.
What else?
When the two of you held each other. When you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine. When your parents were out and the two of you were alone... completely alone in that big house.
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
What?
I'm talking about you.
You never spoke to me before.
Are you?
My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking.
So, you're not a dyke.
No you're not.
How about in the morning.
Hey, there.
So, what did you do?
You know, this is crazy.
Being here, with me.
I got poked around... here and there.
Are you serious?
It's a bad idea.
I say we call it quits.
I didn't sleep well.
I heard they were filthy birds.
Where are we?
God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
I think it likes you.
He's jammed the mechanism.
It's flooding like a son of the bitch.
Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools?
Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan...
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
Look, it's three AM.  These guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep.  You better start cutting them some slack.
That's Perry.
Come on, man.  What else could it be?
Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. You got all that?
'Fish'?
Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.
You better not say you missed that.
Y'all could be more specific.
Lady, we better fish or cut bait.
Cab One, radiation readings?
Copy that, continuing forward.  You just want me to get shots of everything, right?
12000 feet.  Jesus, I don't believe he's doing this.
Uh, oh...
Stand by on the ROV.
Would we see the flash?
But your friend is waiting downstairs.
I'd like to find a place where I can get some peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere. I'd like to try...
A little more so this time.
I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
You know, I could just as well go without seeing him today.
Claudia, aren't you coming?
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.
Have you decided?
I think you're very sweet, Corrado.
I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
As far as I'm concerned, I think she's alive... Why, even this morning... that business about the shark... it wasn't at all true.
Where are you going?... To Montaldo's?
For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?
But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me?
Promise that you won't try to look for me... you shouldn't try to look for me any more...
Sandro, I'm not coming down.
Now what do I have to do to be left in peace?
How did you spend the night?... In that hut?... And what did you have to eat?
Claudia, I know how you feel, but there are already two of us staying...
Up until now those smugglers were operating only around the Palermo area. This will be a nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo... Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate.
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
I work there but I'm really a stranger.
Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here.
But where did you come from?
Now, tell the truth, aren't you a bit disappointed?... But I already told you...
You've made some mistake there with the bushes... that's why you can't finish it.
I would like to ask you something.
Yes, but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? Even if I sent it, the editors wouldn't print it.
I'm a blimp.
Because...
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
No... I mean... I mean look at these. I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp.
But she watches... she listens.
I don't know.
Let's talk about something else.
Well, who in particular?
I got sicker.
From their heads...
Do you have any children?
Do you know a Marie?
Sister Paul was in her eighties?  Did she climb up here often?
Like what?
Who?
Agnes...
What the child?
How?
Agnes, you're stupid.
And why am I here?
Of telling you.
How did you have a baby?
Did you want it to come out?
What is it?
A crucifix.
No.
Why isn't anyone coming?
Are you frightened?
It's bleeding... I'm bleeding... my God it won't stop, I can't get it to stop.  Let go of me, I wish you were dead.
What did you do?
Look into the convent records.
Larry...
I don't know.
Thanks. 
I'll have a decision by next week.
Marie's dead Mama.
The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens.
Yes.
Do you still go to church?
Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.
Was there a priest?
Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.
I believe Agnes is different.
Who?
That's absurd!
Not simple, no.
Nuns... you hate nuns.
I'm only interested...
All right, what do you need.
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
Oh, Dear God...
The sheets...
Like keeping her home from school?
Listening to angels?
Do you know what she did to her?
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
I'm out of prac...  ... practice. 
Even Christ would partake socially.
Mary Magdelen?
Right.  What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
I've just met with the bishop. We're taking you off the case.
Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?
The usual ten per cent?
Nine.
Shurrup!
Sure.
Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.
That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?
Would you like to be a little more precise, sir?
I see you go to the night court.
You never know, you might be lucky this time.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
She's a trend setter. It's her profession!
You see, he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher.
Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
Did you look in here?
Oh, Paul, you can't have your own way!!!
Oh!
Oh, it's the way you talk.
Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
And what do you do about it?
At least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!
Do you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
And we're looking after him, are we?
That'll keep you busy.
All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
Anything to spare?
Aye, he looks a right lurker.
Give 'em a pull.
I hope he fell off.
Behave...
Eh, have you got Paul's grandfather?
Oh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.
Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray.
Is it?
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
You're a window rattler, son.
That's mine.
Do I have to raise me voice?
Yeah, down the ... er ...
Oh they've probably gone to the canteen, cup of tea, like.
What?
Put it this way, he's mislaid him.
Oh, a little savage, is he?
Oh... God... am I cold...
Do you remember the pyramid?
Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.
I'm sending.  Do you hear me?
I'll go first.
What's up?
What is it?
I was scanning the horizon to see what I could pick up.  Look there, on that screen.
Yes!
Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.
How long to fix?
Hello, Faust!
You know what they make this stuff out of?
Hurt!  How?
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
Hey, guess what?
There's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge.  I'll go get it.
We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose.
Hey now, what is this?
You know, it's fantastic -- the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form, and now we run into a veritable zoo.
We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there. 
You can't say that; I think it's a good plan.
It will be.
Well... now we have to herd that thing up here.
Why, you chickenshit bastard --
Look at that.
This is horrible.
We can't kill it on board.  It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.
What about all the minerals and elements in the cargo hold?  That's the only reason we came out here. We'd have to abandon them all.  We'd be broke.
I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.
Too primitive.  It's a pre- technological construction.  That slab was engineered by an Iron-Age culture at best.
We came out there, we'll go back.  A long time by the clock, but a short time to us.
It appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort... it blocks the X-rays...
We do know that.
All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.
Where are we?
Oh my God.
Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.
10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.
Find anything we missed?
Hey, can you guys hear me?
Would somebody fill me in?
This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing.
Now what?
How did it get so <u>big</u>?
Can you make out any pattern in all that?
That next thing there -- six legs, tentacles -- that's the thing we saw in the food locker.
Which presumably means...
I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.
<u>Hey watch it</u>!
All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.
No... don't...
Headache?  Dehydration?
Me either.  I tell you, I used to be with a mining outfit on Callisto, and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it.
I can't reach her.  Too much signal break-up.
Picking up velocity.
Oh, man...
Careful of that edging there...
Still got him?
Is it still moving?
That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here?
Is this the suit?
They've changed their heading again.
I'm serious.  That's why I switched from orbiting to planetary installations.
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
Do you believe him?
So, what do you think?
Hello, there. Who are you?
How do you know my name?
And what is your name?
Phoebe?
I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly...
It needn't be.
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...
Some plain soda.  Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven...
We're?
Addison, just a few minutes ago. When I told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything I wanted-
I see. And when was this unholy alliance joined?
What do you take me for?
I still don't know what you're getting at. Right now I want to take my nap. It's important that I-
Champion to champion.
I can't believe my ears...
Belong - to you? That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...
You're too short for that gesture. Besides, it went out with Mrs. Fiske.
That's not true!
Then say so.
I won't play tonight.  I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on...
I'm giving her a very high-class party. It ain't like a rehearsal, she don't have to be late.
Margo? Lunching in public?
Miss Caswell got lucky too late. The audition is over.
In time she'll be what you are.
Only in some ways. You're prettier...
She's quite a girl, that what's-her name...
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
What a thoughtful, ever-lovin' thing to do-
Outside of a beehive, Margo, your behavior would hardly be considered either queenly or motherly!
Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
- shows up for an audition when everyone knew I'd be here... and gives a performance! Out of nowhere - gives a performance!
Paranoiac!
I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...
Bill...  ... where are you going? To find Eve?
The so-called art of acting is not one for which I have a particularly high regard...
But you may quote me as follows. Quote. Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play, the like of which I have never seen before and expect rarely to see again. Unquote.
Every day.
Ah...
- and for you.
There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's-
Adorable. We now got everything a dressing room needs except a basketball hoop.
Who are you?
I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
That's all.
You're going to Hollywood - aren't you?  From the trunks you're packing, you must be going to stay a long time.
Now who's show up at this hour? It's time people went home - hold that coat up...  ... whose is it?
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
Yes, you will. You Theater people always do. Nothing is forever in the Theater. Love or hate, success or failure - whatever it is, it's here, it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone.
I think I know...
After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
She knows enough not to be here.
No, thank you.  Yes. I've seen every performance.
How'd hear about it?
Well... it started with the play before this one...
Stick around. Please. Tell you what - we'll put Stanislavsky on his plane, you and I, then go somewhere and talk.
The curtains. I made them myself.
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
Don't get up. And please stop acting as if I were the queen mother.
Hi.  Hello, darling-
Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
Dear Birdie. Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?
Not to you. Not to Bill.
I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
About Eve. I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her, too.
Margo.  Margo, I want you to know how sorry I am about this...
"... my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington. I am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops." ... I thought that one went out with Woollcott...  Down here... here, listen to this- "... Miss Harrington had much to tell - and these columns shall report her faithfully - about the lamentable practice in our Theater of permitting, shall we say - mature - actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory-"
It get better! "- About the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched First Ladies of the Stage to encourage, shall we say - younger - actresses; about Miss Harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity-"
- 'at's my loyal little woman.
Lloyd, be careful...
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
I'm glad Bill's back.
Darling, I didn't promise Eve anything. Just said I thought she'd be fine for the part, but there were some practical difficulties...
Honey chili had a point. You know, I can remember plays about women - even from the South - where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers...
Don't be evasive.
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago-
I placed...?
"Liebestraum."
Well, if she can act, she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation...
You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way... and you need her, Max.
I said I'm a dying man!
Carl?
All right, what do we know?
--I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.
What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?
That was fun.  What now?
Anything you've got.
Goddamnit--
--for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories?
Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in.
--because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed.
You think we're being set up?--Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names.
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
What's the matter?
I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.
You overslept?
You want Barker's phone stuff or his money stuff?
Hi, it's me. I'm still here.
During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.
Can't help you.
FBI too?
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure?
--if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--
--I saw him. He verifies.
Go on.
In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.
And Justice and FBI know all this?
And the underground garage one.  Would I know him?
But it's possible.
You've never told anyone who he is?  But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.  Tell me.
Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  "...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."
--has any of them got an ax?--
--no--
--and he says Chapin hired Segretti--
Does "they" mean the White House?
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
A boy or a girl?
--and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson or the President.
I'll do it.
You're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee?
Of course, Finch.  What?
What are we gonna hear?
You know, Jim...you could go back there...and...
Oh sure.  I know what people think. It's like, Oz, he's just this kickass lacrosse player -- I also play football, by the way -- But that's like...not <u>all</u> that I am.
Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
You're missing the game for us?!
I can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy.
Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.
Thanks.  It was my idea.
Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good.
And you said...
Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old.
What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
Hey, where's Finch?
Hey, minuteman.
What the heck is this?
Yes dad.
Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I know what you're talking about.
Dad.
Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm angry?
So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.
You can do that?
Yes.
Oh, Kev.
And I want to try to make it up to you.
We've come a long way since Homecoming.
Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it.
Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
Hey.  I got another question for you.
Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that.
Contact, dude.
The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?
NOVA!!
God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.
Really?
Look, the more you think about it, the harder it is.
Okay... dead or undead... what do you want from me?
Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
Wait a second, are you like the Steven King of France or something...
Andy! Holy shit!
What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour?  My treat?  Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you!
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
This looks familiar...
You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.
I hope they fucking fry us all.
Andy?... What? What is it?  Andy... are you okay?
Didn't even have to ask.
No wonder he let her go.
Whoa...
Oh God. Shit...
GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
Nothing's happening!
We know you were with her.
I don't believe we've been introduced.
All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power!
The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
Yeah. I guess so.  Did he say anything? Before the coma?
I'm afraid she's not so lucky. She's undead. And so am I.
Alright. Let me write a letter.
You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.
What were you showing her?
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
Anya! What if <u>we</u> can't find anyone who loves us?!
We're just going to refresh your memory...
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
Forged papers! Now, what?!
You must enjoy causing me pain!
Every Russian family has one..
What a beautiful ship!
I'm sorry.
Don't let me go!
Anastasia! It was just a bat! It's gone, dear...
Don't you, child?
Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
Bartok ... have you ever been to Paris?
She doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . .
Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.
What do we do now?
See? The Princess is under there ...
Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down!
What's your name?
Hey!
Excuse... excuse me, when do I go on?
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
Yeah, Earl Warren?
I-i-i-i-it's all right, fellas.  Jesus, what'd you do, come by way of the Panama Canal?
I-you know, I don't wanna.
Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator. I can't get it out. This thing's heavy. Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what I mean?
Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.
Huh?
You're the worst driver I've ever seen in my life... that's including any place... the worst... Europe, United... any place... Asia.
Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic, by the college-girl mentality.
Fifteen years, huh?
what I mean?
Yeah.
No, I'm gonna quit!
Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
Yeah?
No.  You're a wreck.
You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.
...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
And blind people, crippled...
Look at these guys.
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
Yes, it is.
No, don't be silly. What-what do we need other people for?  You know, we should-we should just turn out the lights, you know, and play hide and seek or something.
What are you doing?
Uh-uh-why?
Yeah.
That is the worst kind of paranoia.
M'hm.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
What is this? What are you, since when do you read the "National Review"? What are you turning in to?
Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I came over to --
Very big spider.
Okay, let me have this.
Hey, what is this? You got black soap?
Okay, okay. Okay.
-me, my God, it's a great day!
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
This "Denial of Death". You remember this?
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
So whatta you... You're not gonna come back to New York?
Okay.  Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
I tell you this because, as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving... on the road at night... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion.  The sound of shattering glass. The... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.
What'd I do?
Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility.
Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it-it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-
Tsch, a few.
Are you?
I mean that as a compliment.
You know, it must need to have had its leading from one thought to another. You know what I'm talking about?
Oh.
Charlie Chaplin.
Sixteen years ago.
Officer, I know what you're gonna say. I'm-I'm not a great driver, you know, I-I have some problems with- with-with-
Don't give me your life story  just pick up the license.
I distinctly heard it. He muttered under his breath, "Jew."
I have some very good memories there.
How about a ginger ale?
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
Oh, that Randolph Hunt. You remember Randy Hunt, Annie. He was in the choir with you.
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
We just need about six weeks, in about six weeks we could cut a whole album.
Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.
How long have you worked for the Therrians?
Was it a contractor?
So who won?
Had a little help?
Isn't Skye amazing?
Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's a woman's director.  And nothing's happening.  Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed.  He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place.
I have a small window of time.
You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
She already has.
So they tell me.  Not soon enough, of course.  How are you, Sal?  You look fantastic. It changes your life, you know.  A baby. It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it.  Doesn't it, Mac?  You can't be the center of your own world, anymore.
You don't have any clothes on.
It sounds hysterical, but Otis just rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like to change into something of yours.  You know it could be disaster.  He's so allergic.  It's terrifying.
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
You know Sophia.  She's so damned judgemental.  And she's so damned... perfect.  And so fucking... serene.  Just fucking don't tell her.  Because you know Mac thinks she's God.  And I can feel him comparing.
Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy.
That for us?
Can I open it?
The suspense is killing me.
But she's alright.
Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.
Oh.  You're them.
Time.  Hey!  Time.  Judy!  Time you guys. Hey!!
There's a test, you know.
Are you my big hard hero?
Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
I suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift. I'm not sure it's in your best interest.
Not millions.
The Roses?  And of course they said yes.
Take your time, Jer.
What was it?  What the fuck was it?
I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.
Kiss the back of my knees.
No.  Did you?
I mean, you're really back.
And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.
Otis!  No barking!
Yes.
Two minutes.
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
What are you saying?
Anyone else?
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
We have a gift?
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
Yes I did.
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
Well, you know...good days, bad days.
Sally did all this herself?
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
Oh, yes.  You know Ryan's been sober eight years.  And it's difficult if I... you know.  It's better if I don't.
A little out of my element.
I need to leave you now.
I'm a little in the puke zone.
Ryan's really angry with me.
That's very nice.
Stop being such a bitch, Sal.
What?
How's he doing?
Ryan.
And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality.
Is there space here?
Otis!!  Shostakovich identified with the Jew.  He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.
Would you, like, marry him?
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
We're just feeling our way back.
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
So how are you really doing, Panes?
You're a shit.
How's the movie going?  Your movie.  You are making a movie, aren't you?
Oh my God, sorry.  I'm interrupting.
Enough about me.
Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Break's over.
Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
I don't know what came over me, talking back like that.  I must be going crazy...
You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!
Well, because he's more than a worker...he's a...what did he call it, Azteca...
General -- we have to talk sometime!
So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
Are you sure this is a real dance?
Really?
No, General.  I'm dancing with the war hero.
Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.
I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
I -- <u>hate</u> -- you.
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
We're going to die!
This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
Look.  How many other Princesses are there?
And only you can become a Queen?
So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...
You new, kid?
You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.
Actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule.  We have thirty-six seconds available right now.
Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!
ARREST HIM!
'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've got abandonment issues.  My father flew away when I was just a larva. My mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention.  I feel physically inadequate -- I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight.  Sometimes I think I'm just not cut out to be a worker.  But I don't have any other options.  I was assigned to trade school when I was just a <u>grub</u>.  The whole system just...makes me feel...<u>insignificant</u>.
We declared war again?  Are you scared?
Time to cut a rug, Z!
Wear this.
Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now <u>dig</u>!
I didn't really do anything -- honest -- I mean, you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're serious -- marriage-wise.
Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
Twenty-seven.
Good night.
No.
Well, it was just an idea -- I hate to see a ticket go to waste --
One more?
Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
That's right.  I told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --
It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
Here. How about some breakfast?
Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first.  Just what are you going to tell her?
And where are you now?
Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
She doesn't seem to like you very much.
You want me to move the television set in here?  You play gin rummy?
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
Thank you.
Tennis racquet? Oh, I remember -- I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.  I used it to strain the spaghetti. FRAN  Why not?
Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
Where are you going? BUD Who knows? Another neighborhood -- another town -- another job -- I'm on my own.
Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss -- I happen to know he was out on a case.
Baxter?
You do?
Oh.
I'm not through with you yet.
Morning, gentlemen.  Everything satisfactory? You like your office?
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
Put me down for Thursday again.
Hello? -- yes -- what's on your mind, Baxter?
You left your wife?
You like?  It's all yours.
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
Now you're being bright?
Now hold on, Baxter --
You're on your way up, Buddy-boy. And you're practically out of liquor.
That Kubelik -- boy!  Would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China.
Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
Oh, Buddy-boy. I was just about to call you.  I'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall. You see, my little friend, she kept insisting Picasso was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but I'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil.
I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --
I sympathize with your problem -- and believe me, I'm very sorry --
Dear Mr. MacIntosh --  Vanderhof, Public Relations. Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.  All right, Miss Finch -- type up what we got so far.  Now what is it, Baxter?
Okay, you made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week I can get away.
Hello, Miss Kubelik.
She'll sleep on and off for the next twenty-four hours. Of course, she'll have a dandy hangover when she wakes up --
Where are you moving to?
No, thanks -- I don't feel like it. Look, Doc -- in case I don't see you again -- how much do I owe you for taking care of that girl?
What about him?
Where do we go -- my place or yours?
Still stuck on her, huh.
Not so rough, honey.
Dreyfuss.
Do you know who this is?  Look at him.
Please -- just let me sleep.
Hi. How's the branch manager from Kansas City?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I missed you, Fran.
It's been hell.
I never said goodbye, Fran.
I mean -- about my getting a divorce.
If you'll just listen to me for a minute --
What do you think?
Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
I know it's a drag -- but you can't find a hotel room in town -- not on New Year's Eve.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
Where do you live?
Stay with it, Buddy-boy!  Come on, Sylvia.
Did you have a nice Christmas?
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell --
I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --
We've been attacked.
Who the hell are you?
North ?
How long were you up there ?
Holy shit.
Chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff?
Chef -- since you're such a fan of Miss December's I think you should be detailed with Lance and Clean to take the first drum up there.
Who's he?
Elevate Lance, in the tree. No, I saw another.
What about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down?
Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --
Whoever put'em there didn't do it to kill people -- They put 'em up as signs --
I only met Kurtz once.
Hey, buddy, that boat still runs, eh?
It's to everyone I really knew -- the first girl I screwed -- my brother -- best friend -- I wanted to tell 'em how much I enjoyed knowing 'em -- it's been a great twenty years. I gotta let 'em know.
You got a chance in that boat -- by morning you could be five miles down the river.
What -- happened here.
Who is he?
How did they know?
Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir.
He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.
We will never 'evacuate', Captain -- this is our home. Indochina is ours; it has been so for a hundred and twenty-one years, there is something to say for that.
Upriver? Why upriver? There is nothing there, only jungle.
It's an honor to meet you Lance. I've admired your nose-riding for years -- I like your cutback, too. I think you have the best cutback there is.
They far enough?
Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !
Change.
What'd you do for supplies?
Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter Kurtz commanded a Green Beret detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
We'll come in low out of the rising sun -- We'll put on the music about a mile out.
Why did you come to ... my province.
Do you?
Going back  - to the jungle to die.
What's that?
No -- no, Captain.
Captain -- that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff?
What's this tiger shit?
What?
Simple. They don't want him to go.
Sounds like he's gone crazy.
Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?
That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.
You came right to it, son of a bitch --
What?
See the blood?  Pack of wolves took down a moose.  Greedy, gut-ripping sons of bitches.  I'd kill the last wolf on earth, right in front of the President of the U.S.  Stinking, cowardly predator, the wolf.
First you save my ass, now you want to kill me.  Make up your goddamn mind.
212  CONTINUED:
Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
Thanks.
I call it 'the Turtle,' as in carrying your home on your back.
I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.
That's not what I meant.
Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.
Had no choice...  ...Given the situation.
You got two counts against you -- trapping out of season and poaching on restricted land.
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
Surviving is what I know --
Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
Don't judge me.  You're a joke, coming here from a fucked-up culture, telling us what to do!
I already have.
Can you walk?
Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
I'll get loose before that plane comes.
Goddammit, I don't need this aggravation.  I'll shoot you, Ben.  Bank on it.
-- Here's a hundred dollars.  And if you or anyone else will back me up on this --
If Corbett's men find out --
Alleged killer.
...You give us a ride in the Cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in Fairbanks in a few hours.
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
Dead.  Trappers killed him.
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
Look, we pull Ben's ass out of the fire, I'll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars.
It's Sam Wilder!
There's what they're waiting on!
You're not still writing that thank-you note?
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
I'm sorry.
Do you love me?
My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher.  She says I have to take great care of this guy because you're urgently needed back at work. What work do you do?
Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?
You're not worried that someone might take him?
You know he's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in.
Oh, please...
I'm hungry.  You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten.
The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
You waiting for me to say something?  What sort of thing do you want? Look, I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.
So. Anything else?
My son.
I'm sure, Simon, they did something real off for you to feel this way... But when it comes to your partners -- or your kid -- things will always be off for you unless you set it straight. Maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance.
No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?
That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
Sex with Simon?
What do you want, Melvin?
It feels a little confined here. Let's take a walk.
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
I've got to sketch you.
I love you...  Let him take you home.
What the heck are those for?
You changed the room around...
Simon, you've got to get dressed.
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.
She's nice.
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
Shall I get her for you?
Terrify me?
Absolutely.
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
Because...  ... you love her?
Picking on me won't help.
What's wrong?
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...  in here.
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a waiter.
Why?  What happened?
That was Peterson back there.  That goes to the expressway for the airport.
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
You don't have to tell me that. It's just, I know my bid was low, but was it too low?  I mean, did I seem like an amateur, like I didn't know what I was doing?
Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus fucking Christ!
What are you doing?
How'd you know?  Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
They money will be standard bank transfer.  We believe we will know where and when.
What?
Who?
Who is the mark?
I know what happened.
Is this how it went, Nick?
Um, five.
Twenty large?  That's all?
And you want to use me to get him?
I don't need the money.
Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --
How?
No.
Had?
He was... taken.
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
They recruited me when I was in high school.
The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
This is fiction!  Don't you see that?  This is another reality.  And the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  They're here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  Do you understand what I am saying?  No one is innocent -- including you!
Hey, where are you?
No.
But you've never figured out a way to win.
What do you think he's doing?
Breakfast.
Where did you learn it?
You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.
He can't.  The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines.
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
I don't believe that.
Nobody ever sees me.
She is married, but not to him. Another man, much older.  She has four kids.  The young guy works for her.  And I think she likes kinky sex.
No?
Who was she?
What happened to her?
Uh-huh.
That doesn't sound normal.
I prefer it like this.
Do you think about their wives or their families?
Is that all you want?
I think I've heard of you.
Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.
Some.
Yeah.
How would you like the funds?
Excellent, senor.  If you could follow me?
Of course, senor.
That's true Doug, writers are supposed to write.
Cheers Katka!
So how's your work?
But we are underground?
Sorry Katka, but I'm with Doug on this.
What about that squat bar you showed me, is that open on a Sunday?
Hmm..Smells good. Cheers!
I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
Okay, it's in here somewhere. Let's keep it quiet.
No, I got nothing till Tuesday.
I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much.
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
It must be on the other side of this.
Nope.
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
Why don't we just take the whole damn building, brick by brick Doug.
I see, you've got your hands too far up your collective arse to pull it out long enough except to drink my bloody wine.
What happened to Katka?
It's...42 56 76 .
I made a deal with Josh.
You mean, Josh's father had nothing to do with it?
You're sure?
Well, he should be on his way back to his apartment by now.
Yeah, pretty well.
It's that one isn't it.
Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
Before you go, did you get those bruises here?
We should be done by the weekend.
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
So why don't you get up and speak something, then we will see who is crazy.
Well, get me and Chris a drink then.
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
I don't want to get in trouble.
It's not fair, you hardly talked to me tonight.
Let's walk over the bridge, we haven't done that for a while.
I hope you're going to invite me in?
But we could go to London and live in England.
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
They'll do it.
You mean you don't know, Henry! We got a bunch of anarchists, controlling a six-level block of luxury apartments down on Janovska street here in the Old Town, and you don't know about it?
Will this thing take long?
Is it dry?
What would you like, beer?
Who you saving the dishes for?
Better than you.
Weren't you going to get some glasses?
We'll have to see what more we can do for you, while you are still our guest.
What is it you want?
Central station, locker number 139 - combination JFK.
All I'm saying Honey is run the thing past me for Christ's sake before you get up and broadcast the crap.
I think we should be going honey.
Honey what a pleasant surprise, sorry to keep you waiting.
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
You are responsible...What has happened?
So, who is in the building?
She's coming over here...
That's one girl who can't take a hint.
Your father dropped off an extra check.
After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. He didn't show, not once.
You look nice. I should have dressed.
What are you doing here?
Everything's being done but it's not enough. I have to find something -- more.
Hypotheticals --
The address?!
Deranged.
Landon!
He goes to my father's church. He could've died --
'I hope your dreams come true.'
I know you don't want help.
Fire is like a living thing. Wild. Unpredictable.
You think so.
You're not in a very good mood.
People can see.
Maybe you inspire me.
All of it.
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
Your turn.
Excuse me?
We can measure wind.
I might do it wrong.
Assholes. This happen to you?
One of your secrets.
You're worried about your college applications.
What are you going to -- ?
Why didn't you tell me?
Slim Jim? Apple? Yogurt? You like yogurt.
Can I -- go out?
I'm supposed to always be alone?
I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God!  I don't even know where to put all my anger.
I'd like to take Jamie to dinner on New Year's Eve.
I care for her.
How about your family?
Her doctors have. Jamie and I. We're still praying for a miracle.
Landon. We've lived with this for over a year now and --
I've almost finished the rocker. Did she order mirrors?
You've been well?
Now I can do what I want.
No way. No thanks. I can't do it --
Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good.
Well, well, he smirked when Marty opened the door. If it isn't the neighborhood bootlegger, Al Capone McFly?
Morning Dick.
You mean you're going to stay up all night?
You remember me...?
What time does school start around here?
Oh yeah.
I don't want to hit you in the stomach!
You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
You have a name?
Okay, Martin. You have a good evening now.
Eight thirty.
Pro, the sun's out!
Shemp is right here in this room...two minutes from now, and at exactly 9:02PM, we'll catch up to him.
The plutonium! That's what I came over here for! Professor, where did you get that stuff?
Pardon me?
4200 rads...  That certainly can't be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age.
Then I would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history! Don't you understand? The fabric of history is very delicate. Anything you do could have serious consequences!
Say, where did this guitar come from?
Your 'mother' wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon, and that if you were interested in going to the dance Saturday, she's available.
There's no way of knowing.
You see, I never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. I decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky. Anyway, experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of Cuba caught Dr. Felstien fooling around in the Bermuda Triangle -- that was back in '64.
But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?
Obviously!  
What happened to Dick Wilson?
What'd they look like?
You ever had to open it up like that before?
Hi.
You still in school?
Quit my job.
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
You're a redhead.
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
Are you sure?
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
Everybody loves trout.
Well, maybe the slope here is throwing it off some. We ought to find a more flat place.
Have you got a better idea?
You didn't walk out here.
Who are you?
You tossed my hat out the window.
Smells fermented.  Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.
We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces!
Buckaroo!  What the Sam Hill!
Planet 10?
That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?
Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!
...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded...
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
He offered you money?
Was she pretty?
You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go with you.  Please...
Stay here, I'll be back.
...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.
But John Whorfin said kill her.
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
What's his problem?
The name's Reno.  This here's Perfect Tommy.
So where's Buckaroo?
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this – believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I – I'm sorry - listen, how are you – I'm sorry. You doing okay?
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
...This'll sometimes help.
Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time-
Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent – don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?
Wuddya got for me – what the hell happened to your face?
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
I didn't say anything-
Yes, generally, to see pap. However, point number two: A brief tenure in Hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays.
Barton? What time is it? Are you all right?
... You got a glass? It's the least I can do.
...Is the egg showing or what?!
Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
...I don't guess this means much to you.
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had one of those days?
...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if my problems amounted to a hill of beans. How goes the life of the mind?
You're leaving?
...I guess it seems pathetic to a guy like you.
...Can I come in?
Jesus... They can tell that...
Sure, Charlie.
It's more than I've got.
But Charlie – why me? Why –
...Where did we put him?
Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
Yeah... rye whiskey?
...I was commissioned yesterday in the Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau arranged it. He's a dear friend.
F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be you, huh?
L.A.P.D.
...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
Charlie... Charlie's back...
Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
Also known as Madman Mundt.
...Maybe we should do a treatment.
Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch!  Get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet!
You're on leave, man.  You're on psycho leave.  I'm talking to a possible whacko here.
The boat blew.  There was a leak in the gas line.  There were two previous repairs.  There was a five-mil policy on both of 'em.  A real heavy investigation.  Zilch. Goose-egg.  It was an accident.
Hey, that's Dr. Gardner, isn't it?
Who?
She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.
What is this interest you've got in her?
I had him in two classes.
Put your fucking hands up!  Don't move.
Don't!  I know about your husband.  You still like girls, Beth?
Were you with him last night?
You like playing games, don't you?
Sure.
How do you know all this stuff about me?
It was an accident.  They got in the line of fire.
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?
Say -- "What do you want from me, Catherine?"
Yes.
You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you?
I'm leaving the house around midnight.  In case you're going to follow me.  I'm going down to Johnny's club.
Are you kidding?  You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
I thought you didn't do adolescent secrets.
No.
You won't believe me.
About three months before I met you.
I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
You like to hang out with murderers or what?  Did you know Roxy --
You still think I kill people, don't you?
No.
I'm John Corrigan.  I'm an assistant district attorney, Ms.  Tramell. Can we get you anything?  Would you like some coffee?
Did you ever tie him up?
What kind of talk?
Talcott doesn't usually show up at the office 'till after his 18 holes. What are they nervous about?
Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?
You know that stuff they say about how you can judge people by their friends?
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
How did they die?  Was there an investigation?
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
Why do you think he's dead?
Anderson.  Jack W. Donald M.  I'm sorry.  No Lisa.
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
It's in New York.
Yeah... Like – stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket.
Jean Michel, this is Mary Boone. She's got the great new gallery.
I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.
Cool.
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
Is Jean Michel here?
I'm interested in showing Jean's work.
No.
It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.
Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.
Do you think I could borrow your limousine? I'll get it back to you in an hour.
I hear your show was sold out already. There's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works.
Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.
Yes, I understand – but where do you take them from?
Would you like to see the wine list?
You want me to put it here?
It's Maria Portos. What should we do?
Willie Mays!!! Willie Mays!!!
No, don't tell me – you just got fired by your crazy boss.
You do! You definitely do.
I thought you hated this place?
You're back.
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
I'm your family.
I'll take the whole tin.
Hi.
How can I ever thank you?
Uh huhh... Band practice?  It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...?
Hey, Rene.
OK! Goodbye!
YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.
Sorry, Alfred, I have to get to the Plaza.  You heard Penguin, he was practically begging me to show.
Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.
Once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good.
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
What happened?
Ingenious costume.  Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody?
I don't know what you want, but I know I can get it for you with a minimum of fuss.  Money, jewels, a very big ball of string...
He napalmed my arm.  He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation.
Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
Actually this is all just a bad dream.  You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.
Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
You certainly will not.
I'm sorry, Uncle, I came to tuck you in.  And...
Uncle Alfred?
Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-
Advanced botany.  DNA splicing. Recombinant animal plant patterns. Pheromone extractions.
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand.
Alpha.  Got it.  What the hell is attack plan Alpha?
Pow!  What!  Kazow!
You were a great scientist once. Don't squander your genius on evil.
Nice suit.  And today you are?
... A giant drilling truck burrowing under the city ...
Watch the first step.
Pull back.  You can't make the jump.
No beauty...
We gotta get those locks changed.
They're overly protective.  You're Not going to hurt me are you, Ms...
What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
I wouldn't bet on that.
He needs extreme cold to survive. His cryo-suit uses diamond enhanced lasers to keep him at zero degrees.
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
I love that belt.  What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?
Their bones will turn to ice.  Their blood will freeze in my hands.
I have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals.  Once you have frozen mankind, my mutants will overrun the globe.  The Earth will become a brave new world of only plants. And we shall rule them.  For we will be the only two people left in the world.
Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter has come at last.
What say we turn up the heat?
Give it up.  If you threw yourself-
What do we have here?  A lovely new supply of Venom.  I'll just take this to my laboratory for further study.
How's the sonar coming, Alfred?
Scholarly research?
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
...A bat.
All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.
Death.  Death. Without taste, sound and all around us.  Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap.
Wait. I have a riddle for you.
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
La'chiem.
A lot of what happened is jagged. Pieces missing. I can't really remember. I just get flashes. Usually in my dreams. I'd kind of gotten used to them. At least accepted them....
If I didn't know better, I'd say you were sulking.
There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I...
Your memories are repressed. They're trying to break through. Relax. Try to remember-.
Where will you go? The circus is halfway to Metropolis by now.
Where are you sending Batboy this time?
Go ahead. You can say it.
How high up would you say that is?
Excuse me, sir.  Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave - -very unexpectedly.  He asked me to convey his regrets.
Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.
Can't we --
...Not even a 'thank you'?
Please.
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost.  Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
We got 'em!
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!
I'm on top of it.  If there's a problem --
Let's beat it, man.  I don't like it up here.
My brother's a priest, man.
Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in?
It's me.  "Sugar Bumps."
Joker here. Can we talk?
... Thank you.
I'll see you burn.  I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
Burned out.  I need a vacation.
Peanuts?
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.
There aren't hotels?
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
Jesus.
0 my god.
Two dollars please.
He doesn't like to say much does he?
Excuse me.  Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you upstairs.
Big day today, huh? 78
It wasn't a dream, was it.  I have to go in to work and tell them Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito.
Look at all this - publicity expenditure ... catering ... all completely fictional ... back as far as June 93 ...
Say that again, son.
Honey, calm down now... it's okay...
You arrange those flowers yourself?
He was incredible.  This guy is fearless.  He has no fear.
Doctor Jacobson?
We need you urgently in C Theatre.
Interesting suit.
You know the thing I hate most about children?
Whoa! I think I just figured something out Beavis.
Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Wait, I wanted her to do it.
Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
Ow! These chips suck.
Ow, let go, Butt-Head!
Me first.
Check it out Butt-Head, TV!
That's not that much.
Well where is she?!
Turd-burglar...
Oh yeah. Can you just take us to Washington? We're gonna meet her there and, you know, heh heh hmmm...
Really? I poop too much.
Uh, we didn't score yet.
Do her? Huh huh.
She's holed up in a hotel room in Las Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the airport.
She sure does.
Ah'm gonna blow you both to hell!
Cool. Huh huh huh.
Shut up, dumb-ass! You didn't score. I scored with both of them...
Get <u>away</u> you little monster.
I don't think we survived the crash.
Barbara, honey!  Don't go out there.  You don't know --
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
That guy is in our cemetery.  Oh, Adam.
Well, I don't know... We don't get many visitors.
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
What time is it?
What?
You don't have an appointment, do you?
He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker.  He's pushy.  He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
We can't.  We haven't left the house since the funeral.
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?
I am <u>not</u>!  Beetle... Juice?
You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
So... You're ready for me now?
W... What is it?
Otho, you've got to help me get Maxie Dean up here.  I have a deal that could make all of us very comfortable.
He's your cousin.
Otho?
I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan?
What do you think, honey?
All right, you dead people!  Come on out, or we'll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with!
Blue-green!  Hydrated chromic oxide!  Remember I'm schooled in chemistry.  I was a hair analyst! Briefly.  Interior design is a <u>science</u>, Delia!  Think of me as Doctor Otho.  And this patient is truly <u>sick</u>!
'I' will tell you what is boring.  Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable.  What's on the third floor?
It does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in <u>sheets</u>!
Are they still here, Otho?
Otho, that's terrible.
All presences have a home space. A place where they live, so to speak.  Where do they hide out?
Their wedding clothes.
You were wrong, it did hurt.
Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
Will you be leaving now, Robert?
I know exactly what you mean. Today the businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they want to do is regulate our natural growth! It's happening across the country!
I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.
Would you care for a drink?
Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.
... Chauncey... Last night you mentioned an old man, that died.
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
... You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you?
... Good night, Chauncey.
Hello, Mr. Gardiner. This is Sid Courtney, Washington Post.
Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.
Do you like it?
Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you?
Yes, when I was younger I had thoughts about public office... But I found, Chauncey - that I was able to contribute more as a private citizen... of course, my wealth provided me with considerable influence, but I've tried, believe me, not to misuse that power... It's extremely important, Chauncey, when one is in a position of eminence, that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country... The temptations are strong, and I've been labeled a 'kingmaker' by many, but I have tried to stay open to voices of the people... I have tried to remain honest to myself...
I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.
... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
Well, if that's what you want, then I want it too.  We can go this way.
It's starting to swell, is it painful?
... Hmmm... Elevator.
... I see.
Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate.
... How long have you been living here?
You look much taller on television, Mr. President.
... Gardiner is laconic, matter-of fact. The scuttlebutt is that he's a strong candidate for one of the vacant seats on the board of First American. But before we can do any sort of a piece on the man, we're going to need facts on his background...  ... Kinney, what did you come up with?
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
Sid, it's useless!
Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
You heard?
I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack?
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
Yes? What have you found?
I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.
... Well?
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
Thank you.
I never played a jewel thief.
I don't know.
Is the trial date set?
I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
I want to try.
I'll meet you on the turnpike.
I have to go back.
What are you doing?
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
And he was with her.
We?
You fell in love with her first.
Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
A better friend.
Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually.
You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.
So how was it?
Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
Mr. Juarez?
Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.
No.
No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.
Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually.  In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
Yeah.
Why not?
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
You're glowing again.
The Great Mantini?
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Forget it.
It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
I blew it, Dr. Lester.
No! Don't harm the vessel!
Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad.  Hi, are you Craig's wife?
Yeah, I saw them
How do we do that?
Never heard of it.
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
Stay in him forever?
No one would ever have to know its not him.
Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
Bad dream, darling?
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
Good-bye, Maxine.
You got to go sometime. You got to go out there by yourself sometime.
You punishing Him, ain't you?
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
They treating you right over at the Bodwins?
That girl...You know, Beloved...
Yes?
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH.
Mama let me help you.
Nobody..no sir..that's right..nobody's going be doing that..nobody going be writing my daughter's characteristics on the animal side..no sir..I don't care..ain't laying that down..no sir. I refuse..that's right..that's right...
Where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside.
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
Till she showed herself.
What run him off? Tell me that!
You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew.
You pick any house, any house where colored live. Pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But you welcome anywhere you want to be. My house. John and Ella. Miss Lady Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for each and every night.
You planning to do anything about it?
I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.
I said I had two things to say to you. I only told you one. I have to tell you the other.
You don't know what I think.
What the hell you thinking, girl? Strolling in here this late?
I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works over by the slaughterhouse. Said she lived on Plank Road.
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
Hiya Allan.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie Treehorn wants to see you.
I know my rights.
Excuse me?
Don't need it.  We're scattering the ashes.
They range up to three thousand.
Fuckin' A.
Sheesh.
What--
Burkhalter.
Kill that poor woman.
Those are good burgers, Walter.
--So he says, "My son can't hold a job, my daughter's married to a fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown. But you know me.  I can't complain."
Jesus, man, can you change the station?
No, they--
...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But it's nice when they offer.
Ahh, not so good, man.
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?
Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I gotta get back.
This is quite a pad you got here, man.  Completely unspoiled.
Of course you do.  I can see you're anxious for me to get to the point. Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?
Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
A hundred.
Oh that's okay, I hardly even--
Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money.  Father doesn't have any.
He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance.  He has no money of his own.  I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.
Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain.
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, Dude.
I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless.  I mean she probably kidnapped herself.
What the hell is this?
Oh shit.  Walter.
There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
Huh?  The problem is--what do you mean what's the--there's no--we didn't-- they're gonna kill that poor woman--
No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
Yeah, and in the meantime what do I tell Lebowski?
That's it.  I'm out of here.
"Our" car, Walter?
That wasn't her toe.
Who the fuck is that?
Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
Uh.
Fuck me, man!  That kid's already spent all the money!
Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard of Vietnam?
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
Huh?
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
Call the medics, Dude.
Well can we--
We're scattering the fucking ashes!
Shit Dude, I'm sorry--
Dude here.
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my--
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man.  I mean, if your wife owes--
What was that?
how long since he was bitten?
Each day is a little life.
Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.
It means "bloodbrother."
Where were you, Whistler?
I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.
So you're going to do this?
What's going on?
So that's down and dirty.  Got anything to say for yourself?
Hey, hey!  The fuck you doing?!
What the fuck you doing?
Yes?
Tell me something, Skid --
What about you?  You're not coming?
Yeah, your little cootchie knew.
It's not very effective in direct sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, of course, is to be like you, "the Day-walker".
Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
The pause that refreshes --  Care for some? Smells good, doesn't it? Pungent, with just an irrepressible hint of iron.
You're not going anywhere.
Guess you're not quite as invulnerable as you thought.
That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner --  This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now --
What are you doing?!
You can't do this, he's human, it's murder.
You let him go --  An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less, this one didn't even talk.
Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them.  See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman.
You're hurt --
What am I injecting you with?
Any progress?
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
How long have we been driving?
Get out of here --
No --
I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?
How's it going, Kam?
I wish you could see the world as I do. Deacon opened my eyes. There's no turning back from that.
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?
What happened to the power?
Not that I can see.
Where they found the backpacks and all the film a year later.
Oak?
--<u>myth</u>--
What?
Then I'm going--
I know you're in there, you piece of shit!
You want a hand?
--last thing I remember were those four clowns shooting the movie--
I don't think it was them.
Hey, <u>chill</u>, man--
Does it hurt?
So lemme see it.
The witch?
I take it back--she <u>wasn't</u> an actor. She's a nutjob.
Never would've guessed.
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
Where's Domini?
--f'chrissake, Heather, it's not like the two of us are gonna doze off he leaves for two seconds--
This is her equally on-the-rag boy- friend, Nick Leavitt--
Either way, maybe there's a book in it, and they both make a ton of money.
Just one lock in this neighbor- hood?
What--
You wanna keep it down, she's trying to sleep.
--it's less than four feet, just--
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
She got <u>paid</u>.
At least go drink it somewhere spilling it won't drive him to suicide.
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.
--I know!
No. We <u>all</u> go.
....Ma'am?
You're gonna keep an eye on Marty and Ray, make sure nothing happens.
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
I could've sworn I heard something.
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
What happened?--Was Meurice there?
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
So how long have you know Meurice?
...He gave me a little pearl-handled .38 for out first anniversary.
...What're you gonna do in Houston?
Well now you do.
...What was that back there?
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
What "what"?
...You get a refund though, if you tell me who else she's been sluicing.
...Well, if the pay's right and it's legal I'll do it.
Well what?
Something I got to ask you, Marty. I've been very very careful. Have you been very very careful?
...Count it if you want.
Don't throw that out.
Howdy stranger.
...Why?
What day is it today, Angie?
Jeffrey. you're not going down by Lincoln, are you?
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Suave. goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
I was the same way when I was you age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Who knows you have these?
Frank?
Frank. he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. come on. He didn't mean it.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
Shit. You better tell me something.
THEN WHAT?
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Yes.
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
Hi. can I come in?
No. But you're in very big trouble.
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. if you need to. come to where I live. O.K.?
What do you want to do?
I want you to hurt me.
Do you love me?
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Yeah, it's me.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
On a ride.
Heineken.
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Now. we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window .alright?
So. what's next?
I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
. I wish you wouldn't do this.  It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
Okay. thanks.
Wow. Should you tell my father?
Yeah?
You didn't tell him about me?
What was that all about?
It's good to see you.
... Sandy?.
Look Jeffrey.
Hi Dad.
Good to see you, son.
How ya doin' Dad?
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Well.
The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.
Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.
No honey, I'm alright.
Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you.  I don't think there will be a problem.
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.
What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not a chance.  So, what's the verdict?
Two years.  George, I can't wait that long.
You can't sell this to your friends.
Excuse me?
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
What the fuck is that?
I don't know...
What did I tell you?
I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
George?  What do you know about cocaine?
That's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo.
How are we doing?
You need to come down here, everybody meets everybody.  Ho ho ho.  Ha ha ha. We do one for good faith and then we talk about airplanes.
Good to see you, Diego.
Touche.
Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is alright.  There's no problem.  Okay? This never happened.  No one has to know anything about this.  Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is.  Do it now.
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
I did not.
Surprised to see me?
Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell him he's not welcome here.
I just can't get over the size of that ring.  I just love it.  Fred, look at it.  Tell me you don't love that ring.
Yeah.  Nice.
So, business is going good.  I've got this import/export thing going on in Miami that's been very profitable.  With my investments...
George.
Jesus Christ.
Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.
Alright.
What?
What do you want?
Mirtha, what's going on?  Everything okay with Kristina?
Yeah.
Mirtha, how are you doing?
California?  You can go anywhere in the world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia. Paris.  And you choose California?
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
California, huh?
I didn't mean to...
I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know.
Yeah?
So?
How much are they paying you?
Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to support the revolution, and then the French help you to escape ...
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
But it's not even midnight yet!
All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
You seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ...
I would have missed it -- but the phone rang and I let it play while I talked.  It looks like blank tape -- but it isn't.  It's been erased without any input signal coming in.
Take some time off.
You did a good job, Charlie.
I don't think that this is the time, or the place.
So she knew about his heart?
What induced it?
Then how did it get into his body?
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
Did they argue the day before he died?
Why would she want that?
Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness.
Objection.  The question calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness.
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
Tell the court about that, please.
She was here?
She told me that tonight we were going to open new doors.  I asked her to stop -- to take off the handcuffs, but she wouldn't listen.
Then you have no way of knowing what Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the reasons for his visits?
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
What did you prescribe for her?
Did he make your life miserable?
What did he say?
What happened?
If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?
I suppose.
Yes.
And you resented that he cared for her in a way he once cared for you?
--And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?
Dristan nasal spray.
P.M.
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me.  That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
He'll file.  He's an ambitious man. Ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others.
Have you ever seen animals make love, Mr. Dulaney?  They have such passion -- such savage emotion.  They struggle, and snarl, and claw, but neither hurts the other.  Not really.
Something like that.
I think we're getting a little off the subject here.
Nothing.
Hello?
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
What's that for?
He was only doing what he thought was right.
You can think whatever you want, Frank -- but I didn't kill Andrew, and I'm not going to prison for something I didn't do.
Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man. A trial like this is going to put Cardenas in the spot-light.
I know -- but she wants you to represent her if Cardenas files.
I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
But Your Honor--
Objection.  The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.
Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you that you are still under oath.
Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?... Well, I was sort of planning on... Alright... Okay, goodbye.  That was Sattler.  He thinks the D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca Lawson.  He wants me in the office tomorrow morning.
Humped
I was thinking that when the trial is over we'd all go skiing for a weekend.
I don't know.
Don't use language like that at the dinner table.
I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.
Boy. It sure has been a long time.
Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white!  Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."
It's a beautiful picture of her.
Eeeww!
Explain to me again why we didn't do this in Des Moines in an air conditioned office?
What?!
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
Don't say that!
Well, I'd like to read them.
Madge?
I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down.
Pretty country.
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
So, how long you've been living here?
This time of year.
Looking for something in particular? There's not much of a selection.
You've got it all right here, you know. It's just as beautiful as any other place I've seen. God, it knocks me out.
Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced?
You must get lonely at times.
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
But no one in particular.
Francesca?
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
Where was she?
What are you doing?
No. Don't do this.
You feeling better Franny?
It clearly states in the will --
Don't feed that dog.
Hey, kid.
Are you nuts?
You think that's really him?
Where's the others?
Yeah, we can.  Least till after this weekend.  He ain't going nowhere.  We'll deal with it then.
You sure got a way with women, bro.  What happened up there?
Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
I said, no thanks.
One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...
Sorry, my brother.
Wait, Jimmy.  Think about it.  You woulda done the same thing if you was me.
Aren't you going to join us?
I'm sorry, Momma.  Maybe next time.
...I've seen things.  In there.  Last night.  You did too.  Don't tell me you didn't.  You were crying like a baby.
I lied.
You got his hands.  Beautiful hands.  I didn't even know.  That night.  When they - we - killed him, that you were already alive inside me.  Life's like that. Grows right out of death.
Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
Guess it's not Rossmore Park.  Thanks for the help.
Careful.  That's bad luck.
Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S.  And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.
The dead get out?
He probably thinks he's saving you from something.  I'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
I'm here.
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
Fair enough for the shit.  But I think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition.
Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
Yeah right, and which ever of us is still alive at the end of the week inherits all Vincent Price's cash.
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
Shit!  Damn dog.  We gonna have to do something about you.
That's right, I know.  I fucking know.
Open the case!
Where is it?
Oh, shit ...
Caesar, I'm leaving.
Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too much.  I have to get out of here.
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
It's impossible!
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
Got to think this through ...
He didn't see you, did he?
It would have been so easy to let him in as you went out.
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in Lake Michigan ...  I need plastic bags ...  tape and rope ...
Where is the money?
Violet!
Shut up, Violet.
Saved me?  You don't even know me. You used me, Caesar, just like I used you.  All part of the business.
You planned this whole thing, didn't you?
You're helping Rajeev?
How many'd you do?
Good.  I hate to worry.  I got ulcers.
Yeah?
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
Cease, can I ask you something?
Hi.  My name is Violet.  We sort of met in the elevator --
Who?
I guessed you were straight black.
Are they really?
Truck.
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
Do you know him?
Caesar is your husband?
Curious, maybe.
Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to seduce you.
The redistribution of wealth.
Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for?
What you heard wasn't sex.
I want out.  I want a new life.  I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky.
Then what?  Exactly.
And where is it now?
Why?
Gino Marzzone.
Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment.  It's a big deal, isn't it?  That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before?
You can't know for certain that he won't see you.
Why?
Jesus, that's beautiful.
It's me.
Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
Oh, thank God.
You know what the difference is between us, Violet?
Johnnie, what did I say?
Mickey?  What are you doing here?
I know you will.
Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It looks like rain and I don't have a thing to wear.
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  He's loose.  He's out of control.  It's very clear what needs to happen.  I have work to do.
I'm going to Paris.
Paris.  I live in Paris...
Treadstone.
What do they want me to do?
I don't know.
I don't think so.
You have your passport?
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
Let me get you a new copy of the proposal.
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
No.  No, I mean, I really don't know who I am.  I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I'm serious.
What are you talking about?
Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
xxxxxx.
xxxxxx
What was I thinking, right?
You have ID?
Where did this body go?
Shit, we didn't sign in.
-- we have rules here, this is a very serious place -- I'm the one who decides who gets in here, okay? --
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
-- let's check that Interpol window again --
-- and they're sure it's him? --
You're American.  I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work --
You're on a boat.  A fishing boat. Italian flag.  We're out of Vietri.  It's the cold that saved you.  The water.  The wounds are clean.  I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay.  It's clean.
You drink rum?
...ergency procedures.
...your ducts?
... And then some.
You telephone, sir.
...ixed itself.
Mumble ... mumble ... mumble ... Tuttle
I know he would have wanted me to help you ... And I promised your mother I'd take you onto the team at information Retrieval. But I gather that ...
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
Sam!
Hello, Jack!
{winking at Sam) She doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really.
OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting.  My tailor,... well worth the investment.
You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
OK. OK. Let's not fence around ... This is the situation. Some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, B58/732 and T47/215.
Christ! You do know it all!
Yes we have, Jack!
I bet you'd like to touch them?
No, really.
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
We? Don't blame me!
What?
I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special.
Sod it, it's broken!
Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.
But I could be anybody.
Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office?
A steak, please. Rare.  Mother, I need to ...
what? ... Oh ... 
But we can get one.
Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At your service.
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
The pace?
Can you fix it?
What am I going to to do with this guy?  Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.
I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons.  Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row.
You're late, Pierce. I know, but I can't fire you. I've got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls.
In that time, you ever have sex?
Frank, take it easy. what happened?
She wanted something to help her sleep.
I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place.
I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
Okay, what happened?
See, I can't do it. I came out of the desert.
Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
That's how it's done. You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
It's been bad lately, but it's always bad.
I think I'd remember that.
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
Don't seem so bad to me.
I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, I can be out quick. if anything happens, I'll be in apartment 16M.
Promise you won't go inside.
I heard CY Coates was brought in. He looked pretty bad.
OK, last night I was weak. it won't happen again. And all that shit I said--it was just because I was stoned. Forget it.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
She only works when I'm on. I make her wait and it drives her crazy.
He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought.
Look at that. A fat junkie. That's a first.
Don't give me that look.
I'll drink to that.
Last show of the night.
He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.
It's not worth it, Tom. He's surrendering.
The brakes are shot.
Get this, Frank--we got two patients. Number one, the scarecrow outside. Number two misses the railing but breaks both legs on the balcony, then throws himself through a glass window, heads to the bedroom, where he's now passed out.
I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight!
I don't know--let's break some windows.
No we can't. He's got a pulse.
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk.
They'll just keep calling.
Faster! God!
I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night.
Okay if I watch you tape that interview downstairs?
One source referred to it as a five billion dollar metal sculpture to ugly to look at and too big to bury.
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
This is uncomfortable for me -- because, well, I don't mean it as a knock, but we approach this differently.
I don't like being handled.
No.  Don't worry about it.
What did they do with you?
You packing up tonight?
London.
Okay.
It's nice to see you.
It's Mr. Buddy Felton?
That's your full name?
I might as well ask you the questions on tape.  Is that all right?
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
Hi.  Turn on your TV... <u>Good Morning America</u>, the <u>Morning News</u> and <u>Today</u> are all about to talk to Arnold Schwarzenegger and I think he's live on at least two of them.
Where's where I asked him about being scared?  You should work on your speech.
He must have been great-looking, right?
They didn't hire Peter Stiller from the <u>Times</u> and he had a great audition tape.
Sounds like you may be on to something.
I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...
Yes.
I saw the smile -- good piece.
That's it.  I resign as of now.
I don't know if we have any younger man more respected in our operation than you.
We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased.  All right?
Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
Do it then.
It's what he did.  I'm proud of him.
The cost-efficient reporter.
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
I was a little nervous there for a minute.
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
Good.  He's on the world's longest ego trip, let him take it alone.
What?
Bye, sweetie.
You don't have to finish tonight.
I got my report card.  Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
Hi.
Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.
I've got another story.
You okay?
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
Yes.
Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like to go.
What?
I forgot all about Aaron.  I promised to stop by and see how he did.
What happened?
He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?
I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.
What?
Why?
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?
What a great surprise.  I didn't think we had a chance.  I heard you wanted to stay in Washington.
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
I converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up.  Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.
What did he do?
How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?
It's true, isn't it?
I like you very much, Walter.
Well that was for your sculpture of the girl.  Your nude in the chair.
But you gotta love me!  Why do you think I made that statue of Alice?!
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
Walter...stay away from me!
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
Well then admit it, it's a work of genius.
Look at that, man.  Big deal.
Man look at that get up !
Man if you want to be a legit artist you have to do nudes, nudes, nudes...
That's alright, we got a pressing engagement!
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
Alright, I'll tell you what.  I'll put it in the corner of the alcove. If it sells, we'll split it fifty- fifty.  How's that?
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
I thought I'm not supposed to sit with the customers...
Whatsamatter Leonard?
I want that cat.  I'll pay you one thousand dollars - cash.
Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -
Did you see my cat?
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
I'm not looking to pinch you!  I don't care about you, or the girl.  But you want to save your ass, you better start telling me what I want to hear.  Now!
Who do think you're dealing with, huh?  I'm willing to cut you a break, chief!
Wait a minute!  What'd I do?
After that we go no more!
It's like...you've turned on.
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
What's all the noise in here!
Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
I look horrible.
... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?
Nice to feel needed.
Nice game.
You're the guys from the movie!
Hey!  She wasted my dog!
When you get your car together, man, let's bail.
Wheels?
Do you know what time it is?
Buffy, honey?
No, you didn't.  When?
You left me a message?
You're even weaker than the others.
Is that your car?
They were vampires, weren't they?
Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a hand?
Who?
I'm going to the dance.
He did what he was supposed to.
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
Bugs.
Totally stale.  And the ushers are like, the acne patrol.  We're thinking Pavilion.  Sitch?
Let's meet tonight, okay?
You were supposed to be here at three.
Time to do what?
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
None of your business.  God.
Here?
What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?
Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject.
All right.
-- like she's gonna kill me.
Well, I guess you got what you came for.
I find it restorative, sleeping in the life-blood of so many.  To feel their souls coursing about me.
No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful.
I can't!
But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers.  Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called.
You think so?
Okay, let's go.
They'll kill us!
The homelesses?
Oh, yeah!
If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.
What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch.
God I'm tired.  What a trip I was lousy.  I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom.  I--
The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
That's my leg.
Fundamentals?
I knew it--you're seducing me!
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
You didn't get "lured".  Women never get lured.  They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
These are the ground rules.  I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training...  And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.  So...  I thought we should get to know each other.
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
Damn.
He' s confused--
You're gorgeous, God damn it! From the moment I first saw you I knew I had to have you.  I had to have you!
And he's right!  A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often.  You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are!  And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.
I doubt that.
God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me?  This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!
I got released.
Ebby's told me a lot about you.
Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?
Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!
Fun?  What's he know about fun?  Why's he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat.
"Naw"?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
Of course.  That's the point.  "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
I'm going to the Show.
I'm trying to thank you.
Nuke...tell me something.  Did you hit me with your right or your left?
No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
I'm too old for this shit.  Why the hell am I back in "A" ball?
I gotta go now, Dad.
No.  If I screw up, I wanta do it alone.  I'll call.
No.
He walked eighteen?!
Struck out eighteen...
You guys lollygag the ball around the infield, ya lollygag you're- way to first, ya lollygag in an' outta the dugout.  You know what that makes ya  Lollygaggers.  What's our record, Larry?
It's a miracle.
Nuke's overthrowing tonight, he don't look loose.  Anything bothering him?
What the hell's going on out there?
So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.
...was gonna stop what came up next at the casino.
That's right.
Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer - answer that at this time.
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
You were wandering around.
...stupid things.
No, you're not calm.
But one thing I could never understand, was that she could have everything under control, except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond.
M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?
Hello.
She's not here, Sam.
I'll call you right back.
Now this is just a signature card.
Yeah, we made a great pair. I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected. The old men loved us. And why not? They all made money with us.
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas.
All right, Ace?
Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years, he always made money with them.
- no matter where he was or what he was doing, he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky- Boy.
...very difficult to get in.
Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you?  All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time.
Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way.
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
Listen, I would -
No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
Back -
Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you -
Ginger called me.
Hello.
...uh, you know, I just wanted to talk to you a minute.
This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine.
You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis.
Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?
...trying to offer you the respect that your...
But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
Why not make them happy?
I-I'll do it.
...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.
The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.
Why're you crying?
You're so wonderful. The jewelry's not so bad, either.
How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
How serious?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
I want you out of here! I want you out of here!
The arrangement is over!
And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street.
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
Hi. You didn't answer your beeper.
I had a... salad.
She had the same.
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
Get - Get up! Get up!
After all the threats and all the bullshit, it turned out Ginger didn't tell 'em anything. But by then, the Feds didn't need her, anyway.
Yeah, thanks for not callin' me a liar. You son-of-a-bitch. You son-of- a
...Well, I've got a large family.
It won't happen again, Sam.
Four reels, sevens across, three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do you have any idea what the odds are?
Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!
You might regret this, Mr Rothstein.
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
Look what they did to my hand, man!
A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did.
Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
Go back inside! This is none of your business!  I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore.
I'm just trying to get in my house!
No, you can, you can.  You've been so nice to me.
Fuck you! Fuck you!
You called my friend a faggot? You tell him to go fuck himself?
Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.
You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.
...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
He's not here?
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an eye on Nicky. Do it for me.
Hi, how are you?
Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
Thank you.
He hates my fuckin' guts.
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole!
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!
Yes!
I'm sorry.
So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it?
- with stupid braces on your teeth.
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -
- back to  Nigeria.  Yeah.
...they're in Penthouse K.
There's more!
There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.
...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come here. Come here. Get him up. Come here.
Sometimes I used to go along on a heist just for the fun of it. But I didn't like the people I was rippin' off lookin' at me, so I used to turn their fuckin' pictures around.
Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs.
And this is Stacy.
This is Nick.
He's here.
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'
Don't know.
Calm down, calm down. Shh!
Take it easy!
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!
You're a little confused?
Since when do you talk like that?
That's enough.
...done right, you gotta do it yourself.
Hi.
Works for me.
Ah, Cats. Now and Forever.

He likes you. Kincaid and I have always had similar tastes...
No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
Strange--you seemed so close. I wonder what's happened since yesterday..
What's the matter...
I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?
I despise these kind of winds. Sorry, I guess I'm a little on edge. Seems this Catwoman has everyone, men and women, on edge. Don't you feel Catwoman says something about the duality of all men and women...
Selina, did you make it home, all right?  I tried calling, but your mother said that there was "no extension in the Hut." Whatever that means..
Car wash, Captain?
I'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three?  You people were once heroes. You had ideals.  You fought for things.  Spooky told me so...
Hello, Spooky.
Can't you understand--I got tired of being a woman. I wanted the respect that only a cape, boots, chestplate, and a mechanical spear can bring..
You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe...
I don't know what came over me.
Sorry, I get carried away. Once I become interested in someone, I can't stop trying to figure them out...Amnesia victims are challenging..
You turned around!
Did you try to kill...
Nothing. How's your hand?
Like you don't know...
You are...
You know, now that I hear myself tell it, I'm thinking maybe both of you are messing with me. What, you get the Helmet Monday through Thursday, then Brock takes it for the weekend...
I'm sorry, ma'am, there are no pets allowed in the library...
I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag...
They're going to attack Frank's Fun Palace!
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for?  Dance with me?
What are you doing on Theo's line?
What was that for?
Yeah, I suppose getting whacked has got to be one of your best ways to die.  Particularly if you're not expecting it.  You don't know what hit you.
Which is why we had a lot more to worry about than the law.  These are people who don't worry about reading you your rights.
And stop with the directions.
Let's hope so.  Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.
I thought you said you could handle him.
Don't fuck around.  Pop a cap in him.
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
Sure.  And they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
Where'd they take you to?
The cops could trace this call back to you.
Fine, no tunnel.  Are you still with me?  Hello?
26th off Wilshire.
Hello?  It's just me and you again.
What do you do for a living?
There are cables overhead.  Hang on.  It'll clear up.
Does she wear glasses?
You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box?
What bank?
What did you do?
They won't allow that.  It's one at a time.  And you have to be first.
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
So far they're keeping their part of it.
The guy with the transplant.
And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
Not all.  They already have a third.  The question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back?
Granted, the cops are not an alternative.  Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
You, I would've noticed.
Now you're starting to sound like a victim again.
I'm still okay.
Did you hear that?
Do you think they'll walk away?
Any idea where you're going?
I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.
I'm handling it.
Some nice fantasy you all cooked up for me.
Five ... six.
Who are you working for?
Where do we meet?
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
I'm here.  Where are you?
It's in the process.
Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
Have your cab wait at the foot of Cisco -- we'll ride up together.
Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
The 405 is coming up.
So can we consider you a regular, sir?
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
See that, Col?
Just cut his hair, you know.
Fuck it, is what I say.
Fuck off, Dave.
Fuck off back to Essex!
Don't chuck my clothes out!
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
Do you mean that?
No, of course not, she's a lady.
If I was her I'd consider that an insult.
How much did that frame cost, Mr. Franknum?
You American?
How'd you guess?
I think you do.
Shouldn't you be in mourning?
Sorry, darling.
See, I was always best looking after someone. Must be something in the genes.
Details, baby, details.
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
Shouldn't be, Dil
She own you, Jimmy?
Do you like me even a little bit?
You said anything, Dil
And you wouldn't leave me?
You promise?
Are you supposed to take that many?
Your soldier.
Yes.
You like me now, Jimmy?
You do?
What was that she called you, Jimmy?
Dil!!!
Fergus. Fergus my love, light of my life - -
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
Fergus!
See does he want some.
Tough work, that.
So you did fuck up.
You were made for this.
You sure?
So it was you all the time.
He's at home.
And what's she like between the sheets?
Thank you, handsome.
I'm not a gambling man.
What do you know about my nature?
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
You make a nice couple.
So what were you fucking around for, then?
Well, in Antigua cricket's the black man's game. The kids play it from the age of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five. Then we moved to Tottenham and it was something different.
Fergus?
Do you?
And you know what?
You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
That fucker's dead --
Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my mama didn't raise no stupid children. I know who's got the money 'n I ain't disappearing till I got my share -- 'n' my share's growin' a whole lot bigger ev'ry day.
I could eat a horse.
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
When you come on, you really come on.
If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
I think we were wrong about Tex having the money.
Lord, you're stubborn.
It still doesn't make sense, but it isn't worth any quarter of a million either. Have we forgotten anything?
Heroin -- peppermint-flavored heroin.
as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 --  no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- Élysées! Adam -- that was it! The garden!
Tex? You mean he's here, too?
Reggie -- listen to me!
I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are?
Only we call them agents.
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
I believe you.
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
Why not?
Dyle, or whatever his name is.
No, what?
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.
Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam?
No.
What's your first name today?
Oh.
You'd lie about anything.
You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
Back where?
I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.
That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
It's the only name I've got. How about you?
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened?
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
Whitefoot, of course.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
Who told you to do that?
What day is it?
Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
What's so illogical about that?
I'd love some, thanks.
Yes, I know.
I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?
The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.
The man's the same, even if the name isn't.
The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.
You sure nuthin's missin'?
There sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million.
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
He was American?
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
Did you?
Up there! It is up there!
But he is gone.
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
Good for you.
Mr. Joshua.  Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
Doing what?
We'll find you a hotel.
What was all that?
You mean you and me?
I wasn't --
We're here.
Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
No, they won't -- I won't let them.
I'm so hungry I could faint.  I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet.
Who is it?
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
Yeah? What's that?
Hi Jody.
She's my daughter, Tom.
I'm not.
It was a she.
You found her?
Hello?
She's not here.
No, you couldn't.
Really?
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
We're all manipulated. From the moment we're born. The event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before I was even born.
Mark Shale.
The seat behind him is open. Come on, I can eavesdrop too.
What am I supposed to say? 'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
Hi Jody. What can I DO for you?
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?
They're not picking me up until six.
I don't know. Where did you hear that name.
Wait.
Two men left town right after it happened.
You ok?
You can't bring it.
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
Rod!

...moron.
Uh, huh?
...and fair...
Aw!  Oh, Jesus.
Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
I got, uh....
Go on.
Billings?  No, no, no, no, no.  We need to go to McGruder.
I ain't goin' through Missoula!
I'm about to get in your ass like last year's underwear, man.
Shut up.
...work!  It's not even load-...
Okay!  All right!
Holy shit...
...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!
Fuck! 
You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!

Come on, old Pete.
Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
Ho, ho...
...ho!
Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!
 Aw, shit  
All right, let's go.
You're not dangerous!  You're crazy!  I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!
I don't want you to come anyway. 
Okay.
I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
And  things sort of just went downhill from there.
 ...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...

They're movin'.
Arlo, shut up.
 All right.  Okay.
...-natic.
Oh, shit.
And Brynner's right on...
Whoo!

Come on.  Come on.



 Well.
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
Patriotism is its own reward.
Thank you very much.
Your move.  Okay, Vaughn, you drive.
Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?


...Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now, where's my goddamn truck?
...here.   Mason... 
What?  Say again...
We do have to take into consideration that, through your courage...
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...
Doc-...
And I changed the schedule.
...the United States into the kind of country we're supposed to be fighting against.
You look fit...healthy...
...years of thinking the matter over, I began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem.
Knowing you, Brynner, you've got buyers waiting to buy! You're not gonna use that...
Get 'em on line, then stall.  Long can't have gotten far.
This is it.
Hit him.
Dennis!
I wanna patch in from...
What about these two?
Having witnessed the effects myself, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts.
Mind if you tell me what's goin' on?
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.
...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
Is this your establishment?

I want you to look at one another...
Because if you don't give me that cylinder, your lives will end...

Oh, caught a few, lost a few.
Ah.
Geneva just pulled the plug.
Forty-nine?
Major, we've gotta seal that tunnel!  Major!
...-five.
Call an ambulance.
And only then does our noble friend realize...
...you, Mason?
Where are you now...
So you don't remember...
...beer.
...to talk, son.
Get in 



Oh.
Look, pal. I make an honest living. People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help 'em out of a bad situation. I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank.
You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.
Lou Escobar – he's a Lieutenant.
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
Why is that funny?
...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?
What about her?
Is she all right?
What does this mean?
You've got her? Where?
Of course I do. Where are you?
Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
I'll throw that in too.
Then what'll you do?
I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.
You're behind the times, Jake. They've got steam irons now.  And I'm out of Chinatown.
Or her name?
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
What are you talking about?
It's too late.
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
No. I went riding rather early.
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.
Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check.
You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
Never forgave him for what?
Know him?
We got it. We got it, baby.
Boy oh boy, you're a mess.
Hold still. Why?
What's wrong?
Where?
The Albacore Club.
It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
I took your husband's Buick...  I'll return it tomorrow.
Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.
I'll take care of it.
On his day off. Get the exact address.
How do you know?
Let me handle that.
Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
The obituary column?
Yeah, Sophie.
There's just one question.
Just to be certain, I wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?
He never even kids about it.
Have we ever met?
Never?
When it comes.
Jake, what're you doin' here?
That's a long fall.
Yeah.
It's bone dry, Morty.
No problem with me on the Job.
It's personal. Has he been out long?
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
How did they get it away from him?
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
Jesus Christ, Walsh. That's what you spent your day doing?
Neither do I.
Course, she settled down nicely.
You must not come here! How many times do I have to tell you?  If the film catches fire, runt that you are, you'd go up in a burst of flame...whoosh! And turn into a piece of...
'Cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so...well, actually...they stay here.  Besides, there are more kisses than you can count.
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 
How's school?
Eh! Love...what a mystery!  I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants... 
I told you, the blue-eyed ones are the most difficult.
Thanks for all you've done for me.
What is it, Alfredo? Right now, of all times!
Father, I have sinned...
Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see. And you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now.
Don Ciccio, I've got an idea...You remember that old abandoned movie house where they're supposed to build those low-rent houses?
Mr. Kane -
"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur -  - last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of - of -"  I can't pronounce that name, Mr. Kane.
Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low...  Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -
My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -
You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.
So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh?  Especially the new papers -
It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful.
Yes.  I thought it was a good idea. We've covered it from the news end, of course.
Sure, sure.
Do you, Mr. Leland?
What's the matter?
Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him?  He wanted you to.  He said to me just yesterday -
If you thought I'd answer different from what Mr. Kane tells you - well, I wouldn't.
I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through.
I thought it would be a nice gesture - the new publisher -
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
Maybe you can do it and maybe you can't, Mr. Kane.
You don't have to show me anything, Mr. Rogers.  I believe you.
Emily, you -
I know it is, Brad -
Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me -
Get out, both of you!
Hey, you should be more careful. That's my ma and pa.
Oh!
That's a ripe old age -  What do you do?
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Would you sing for me?
Yes, I would.  That's why I asked.
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.  I just couldn't -  I couldn't go threw with singing again. You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you.  That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you.  Even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know... They don't want you.  They just 0
I mean in New York.
Hurray for the bulldog!  Half past eleven!  The shows have just let out.  People are going to night clubs and restaurants.  Of course, we're different.  We live in a palace - at the end of the world.
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
Anything you say, Mr. Kane.  Only we're talking now about what you are.  That's what the note is about, Mrs. Kane.  Now I'm going to lay all my cards on the table.  I'm fighting for my life.  Not just my political life.  My life.  If your husband is elected governor -
It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people.  You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical?
I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.
Impossible!  Impossible!
"Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast."  You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast.
Mr. Thatcher, isn't everything I've been saying in the Enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true?
Get Dr. Corey.
Is Mrs. Kane - 
Close the door, Raymond.
That's the second sentence you've started with "I" -
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
Say, Brad.  I've got an idea.
I mean I've got a job for you.
You start tomorrow night.  Richard Carl in "The Spring Chicken."  I'll get us some girls.  You get tickets.  A drama critic gets them free, you know.  Rector's at seven?
Yes?
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks -  Nobody can blame me because -
First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "Enquirer."
There's no reason why this - this savage personal note -
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth. 
Oh, yes, the bonus.
It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?
Sorry, Mr. Thatcher!  What the kid needs is a good thrashing!
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
Or Rosebud?  How about it, Jerry?
Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...
I'll get to it right away, Mr. Rawlston.
That's the whole works, right up to date.
How did you meet him?
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?
It's not the same.
Jesus!
Excuse me, but...
Fifty-five.
Like I'm responsible for all the smokers!
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
He was?
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang.
This is the last time I come to this place.
Are you open?
My point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job. You can't just do anything you want while you're working.
I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!
Awww, he's so cute. What's his name?
I saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week. Then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a Koala-fish mutant bird. Crazy shit.
Cute cat. What's his name.
You open?
What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
You only brought one ball?!
That's what I said.
Seven months.
I'm talking to myself here.
...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
It would stand to reason, yes.
And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.
What's he looking for?
Why doesn't he just mix and match?
What's a jizz-mopper?
Oh, it's great. You step into this little booth and there's this window between you and this naked woman, and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks.
Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss.
Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call.
Vermont?
He's blunt, but he's got a point.
Are you gonna lock the store?
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
Jesus.
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
You hardly knew her!
You were saying?
Broke his neck.
Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
His dick was in his mouth?
I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in.
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
You know what? I don't think I care for your rationale.
What?
All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks.
There's no lights back there.
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
Thirty-seven.
It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you?
Am I right or what?
How's your eye?
No thanks. I'll take care of it. We've got a lot of shit to talk about.
Are you open?
I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class.
I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
Oh for God's sake!
And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey?
What?
What's that mean?
Be careful.
And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...?
Oh... Can I help you?
I said go ahead.
Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
What were you doing up so late?
What were you doing?
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
You were making a generalization about "broads!"
But... but you said you only had sex with three guys! You never mentioned him!
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
No, but you sucked enough dick!
He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class?
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
Thanks. I thought I was gonna have to go to the hospital.
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
Like hell you are!
Willam!
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
Hal's signalling he's OK.
Jessie, Hal, come in...please report.  Over.
Looks like the Tower.  It's a bad climb.
Go on, fetch.
Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
Take the gun.
There you go.
Please -- oh, no -- please!
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
Where?
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!
It was great.
Nice view, huh?
Gabe!  Are you alright?
Gabe are you alright?
They'll kill him!  He has no idea!
These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300.  I'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold.
My heart can't take much more of this.  Look, if we climb down from here, it'll take two hours to get back to the station.
What do you think?  Maybe I could reach the ledge without falling. No, forget it.
Your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.
For Christ's sake, they're kids.
You son of a bitch!  You said you wouldn't kill him!
He never hurt anybody.
What's your names?
What the hell are you doing--
Get off my back, Qualen!
I don't trust him.
Jessie?  Looks like your friend found company.
This is insane.  The hell with the money.  You radio in for that chopper, understand!
Been punished, yeah?
My wife... Alex freezes.
You see, madam, I am part of an international student's contest to see who can get the most points for selling magazines.
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
Ah, Alex boy, awake at last, yes? I met your mother on the way to work, yes? She gave me the key. She said something about a pain somewhere... hence not at school , yes?
No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him.
I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.
It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
Who said that?
Well, who can blame them, sir?
Certainly, sir. What do they call you at home?
As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.
That's right, Dad they did a great job on my gulliver, I'm completely reformed.
Well, still the same old place then, eh?
Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell.
Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think I'm awfully stupid. He slaps Alex in the face.
Yes, sir.
Blue eyes?
Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
Have you ever had any mental illness?
No, sir.
Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.
Something like that.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Just part of hospital routine.
Now then, each of these slides needs a reply from one of the people in the picture. You'll tell me what you think the person would say. Alright?
I hope so. Is that the end then?
I was quite enjoying that.
Very soon now the drug will cause the subject to experience a death- like paralysis together with deep feelings of terror and helplessness. One of our earlier test subjects described it as being like death, a sense of stifling and drowning, and it is during this period we have found the subject will make his most rewarding associations between his catastrophic experience and environment and the violence he sees. Alex retching violently and struggling against his strait jacket.
Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
Father, I have tried, have I not?
No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.
I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.
One jacket - blue pinstripe.
Sir, 655321, sir.
Moloko-plus.
Yes, I heard. D'you know what time he got in last night?
Hullo, son, how are you?
Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block.
Like what?
Not quite.  He did defense.  I'm a prosecutor...
Soon.  But I take little ones all the time.  Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.
Thanks for everything, Max.  Wow...
Annie...it's Max.
...he's two floors below you.
...I was just a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables in this very place.  Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point.  Being around the music, that was the thing.  And I was.  Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in?  Mr. Louis Armstrong.
You know Dmitri?
Lay it on me.
I picked up a tail.
Vincent.  Do not cross me.
Lemme tell you something.  Vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts.  Nobody even know what he looked like until now...
It's nothing.
You're gonna cheer up.
Yeah?
Hello?
How long you think this'll take?
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
Bullshit.  You probably know the light schedules, too.  Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing.  Five stops, one night.  I gotta catch a six a.m. flight.  I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures.  Why don't you hang with me?
You - you killed him?
Try some deep breathing.
Listen.  I'm not trying to piss you off, see?  Okay?  I can't drive you around so you can murder folks.
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
Lenny?  You're an asshole.
Collateral damage.
Yeah?  Like what?  Limos?
What, no insurance?
I'll just hold onto it for you.  In case they check.
In case he asks.
You get benefits?
Damn, Max.  I'm impressed.  Really.  I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there.
Head towards Union Station.
Get with it.  Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us.  Lost in space.  The universe doesn't care.  The cop, you, me?  Who notices?
They said send you downstairs.
She must be some girl.
Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
What's the charge?
Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
Cold War's over, Jerry.
What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore?  If I was normal.
You're wrong.  Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
You look great.
We're going to Queens?
After you.  It's okay.  I'm the one who left it here.
How do you really know there's gold in Fort Knox?  Just because they say so?  We should go to Tennessee and demand to see it.
Jerry.  Please.  You don't understand.  I have to know.  It's all I think about.  Do you have any idea what it's like not to know?
Back where?
Blue moon...
How did you know?
You've been my best friend for years and I didn't even know you were out there.
They changed Franklin's portrait.
I love you, too.
Do I know you?
I'm a very patient man.
Liza Sutton is dead.
You made your decision yet?
I'll do it.  On one condition.  I want to make sure she's okay.
<u>Why you</u>?
M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
I'm still listening.
Belief is immaterial.  What's important is the truth... It's been my job to find Jerry.  I'm very much responsible for him.
Go ahead, Miss Sutton.
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
Go to the northeast corner.  Call a cab.  Bring the pizza.  Then there's a poem.  Roses are red, violets are blue, if the Pope goes to Washington, I would, too.
When I'm ready to compare notes, I'll let you know.
Can I talk to you a second?
I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile.
He's why I watch Jerry.  Jerry's the bait for Jonas.
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
We have benzel activation, repeat, we have benzel activation.  Control to Arroway, you okay in there?  Repeat, Control to Arroway, come back.
... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  As your father?
What in the hell...?
-- Or 'you're our kind of people --'
Now I remember why I went into theoretical work.  Kent.
Last week, about 3 A.M., Fish -- Dr. Fisher -- was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry.
And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
I disagree.
Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
It's not like you've given me much choice.
Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator.  We think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention.
... Arrangements also have to be made for the V.I.P.s coming in, mostly religious leaders...
You mean --
They knew our level of development. If, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications.
Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair...
Here, right around Centaurus A.
I'll come right to the point, Doctor.  Your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of National Security.
Colonel Jarrod, I'd like a twenty mile radio-silent perimeter put around this installation immediately.
... I don't understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.
Could we hear God?
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
So who...?
So.  What happens now?
You've... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?
Not if you think like a Vegan.
A machine.  But a machine that does what?
Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't make deals... But.  If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment.
If we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it.  This time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology.  The moment when contact becomes possible.  We've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now.
But what about your research -- ?
And you think I don't want those things?  You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday?  Let's get married.
You sonofabitch.
That you, Valerian?
Champagne please.
... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years.  You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  It must have taken tremendous faith.
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
If you came back.  If you survived at all.  Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't.
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
So.  The final countdown.
During the crusades -- pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they'd actually been there.  I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land, so...
You're trembling.
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
You have a question, Dr. Arroway?
You kill me, you really do.  The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it.
Boss, I made an arrangement with that man to take his broom.
Buck is a deal.
Well, Arletta, I got to stand down here.
You never thought that's a heavy load?
We saw the broads.
Captain says to wait 'til the Patrol gits here.
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
You gonna get used to wearing them chains aftera while, Luke. But don't you never stop listenin' to them clinkin'. That's gonna remind you of what I been sayin'.
You gotta mind your manners, you actin' like a hillbilly tramp.
Uh-huh. And he ain't got nothing showing. Raise his head off.
He ain't eating beans fer lunch.
Lemme see it!
Oh lookit that brunette.
Well, whatta we got here?
Oh we got our sources... Tearing the heads off... what was it... gumball machines? What kind of thing is that for a grown man?
Man, this here Newmeat parking meter bandit thing what calls itself Luke don't know nuthin' 'bout nuthin'.
Hey, buddy. Take it easy. You're making me look bad.
Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.
What you mean, Luke?
Not a liar. You just have a common -- and likable -- tendency toward exaggeration.
Koko, write down their names, don't just make marks.
All right now: get mad at them eggs. Eat it there boy! Bite it! Gnaw on it!
What's the writing say?
Man, you play like a kokonut. You got to call him at least.
Picture's a phoney... Cost me a week's pay.
I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it.
You parked right behind him.  The one I noticed earlier.  I didn't say anything, I thought he'd leave. Just take a look.
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
Where have you <u>been</u>?  What happened to your wallet?
The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
I thought he was lying.
What book?
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.
We'll keep talking.  Until they get here.  Then... 
Oh, please.  I know what's coming, now.  "Let me help you..."
Who?
Is it an ongoing case?
The bodies have been carefully arranged... different positions, but somehow the same.  The positions are brutal... yet quite... artful.  It's like... a signature.  He's proud of his accomplishments.  There are early Picassos and late Picassos, but you always recognize the hand.  He wants us to recognize <u>his</u> hand. I've seen this hand before... what are you hiding?
That's amazing.  A whole new book, thought up in a minute.  Very good.  All I know how t do is get up, take a shower, and go to work. Hope, if he does another I'll nail the son of bitch, and they'll spell my name right in the newspaper. Where is Andy going?
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
Helen -- the killer directly contacted you.  His interest in you is <u>intense</u>.  I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you.  I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him.  So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate.
You're afraid of him.
Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44.  It's Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?
Let's speed up the game plan... call all the living serials to ask if they've had contact with a Peter Kurten.  We could use some help on the phones...
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
Why can't I drive home?  I will. You.  Look at you.  <u>You</u> need a ride home.  And you don't even know it.
You were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank? Oh God, I <u>am</u>!  Make them some coffee.  Halloran, is it?  Investigator Goetz?  I had a crank call myself-- he said...  I thought it might be Daryll Lee Cullum.  I thought he might be out of prison.
The lock...
It's a woman shot in a car?
They all have one...
I was.
Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later.
Well, you outranked <u>me</u>, Nikko.
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
Absolutely.
I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll be in the jail when you wind this up...
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
Teach both of them a lesson in cooperation and self-discipline.
Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him?
That was Bundy.  He killed forty of them, identical, long hair, parted in the middle, alike as Barbie dolls.  ...this is hopeless.  Let's try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and TV hookups and broadcast a warning?
... third Bay Area woman has been strangled, but the police continue to deny that this is the work of one killer.  Lt. Thomas Quinn declares that the murders will be treated as unrelated crimes, unless new evidence...
Detective Niccoletti?
Inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the Boston Strangler?  This is the fourth, is that correct?
He's not treating her right...
Not a lot of action here.
That's going well, then.
Where's the car?
Renata tells me you're going to rent a car.
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
They're questioning Vaughan about an accident near the airport. Some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally.
You'd better drive him. He's a bit shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where is yours?
The airport? Why? Are you leaving?
Do you want a cigarette? I started to smoke at the hospital. It's rather stupid of me.
I've found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. "Anywhere", I said.
Are we allowed to park here?
Can you drive?
What kind of place is this?
What?
It was just a little going-away gesture.
Maybe.
What do you think of this one?
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
What's all the dreck?
Will you get time off to do that?
I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul.
Yes.
Which flowers did you order?
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
Honestly, Letty.
Letty, you should be in bed.
You've been so great. I just feel a lot clearer about things.
A while, I guess.
You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner.
John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk.
Guess which hand.
Nervous? Scared? Worried you're not fit for a caper of epic proportions?
You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, "It's a good thing I love you."
I do.
I love the pillows.
Who ever said sanity was fun?
Four interviews. Four no-gos.
Silly?   Silly am I?
Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you upset my Mom.
I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to blame you.
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
What are you doing?    You're going to be late.
But what about that math project?
No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.
I don't think so.
I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time...
Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.
It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.
No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
Zero.   That's all I know.
Too many people know about my involvement in this.
Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.
Oui.
You've already robbed the safe?
Good. I'm doing good. How you doin', Frankie?
Okay. I understand you're interested in one of our properties?
You told me that on the phone. What the hell are you doing here? Showing off your communication skills? Go back to your people and tell them when they're serious to put a number on the table.
Frankie, come in. Good to see you.      You want something?
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
And for my help I would get what?
I just want you there in case there's trouble.
Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.
Do they come with batteries?
Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us.
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.
You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine.
We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.
It's not?
It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
All right, knock it off.
Hadley --
Anybody hungry?
Did you have to use that much explosive?
Don't bullshit me.
Hey you guys are becoming famous.      I was just watching the news and--
Okay, we're square now, right?
Maybe you should call the police.
-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
No, I didn't.
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
They don't serve wine here.
A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther.
-- I want to be Elvis.
You guys used to work together?
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
Anybody know about that car outside?
Yeah.
He speaks about himself in the third person?
I think we went the wrong way.
J&amp;B?
It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.
I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?
Okay.    Okay.
I don't care about your sword.
Yes.
Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?
And if I use them to kill you?
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  You, too, are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.
I'll socialize with whomever I please.
But I have had much practice.  As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.  They'd let me play with their weapons.  The scabbard is so beautiful.
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
Please.
You, sister...
Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's sword.
You can't die!  Tell us what poison you used!  You can't die!  Tell us the antidote!  You can't let Li Mu Bai die!
Lo?
You shouldn't have come.
No more hitting on the head!  All this trouble for a comb?
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
Good.  And how are you?
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
She needs direction... and training.
For her, they might make an exception.  If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues.
They're gone.
I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?
This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
What in the hell... do you call that?
You buying?
Just don't tell me you "owe me one."  What file?
You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --
Don't interfere.
Hey, Darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --?
Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man.  I nearly had a fucking heart attack.
Does she have a name?
You gotta go now, I bet.
You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.
I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star.
Holy shit... you're dead, man...
A year ago.  A very nice lady circulated a petition.  She died. Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no.
Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.
Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury.  And it turned out to be you. At last.  I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them.
And how many lives have you destroyed?
Neither.
No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- !
Miss her?
Did you see an animal of any kind? Did you see a bird?
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
Why not?
I read your teen beat manifesto.
Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
You've read The Fountainhead?
You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
You don't even know me.
That's none of your business.
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
No, not at all.
I'm... I'm alright.
Lighten up.
My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino.
Because I'm in love with you.
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
Good for you.
How am I a hypocrite?
Why aren't you understanding?
Ben Schwarz.
Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -
The football stud?
Ronald is one of the few high school students attending Juliard. He's composing his first opera.
I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum.
What are you scared of?
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.
Why didn't you do something?
My father just took me on a trip to Australia.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry that was out of line.
Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.
But -
Want to join me?
Want a blow job?
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.
Jesus Christ, is she for real?
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
I'm at your service.
Moving along quite well.
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
Morning!
So? How'd it go last night?
If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no.
I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
Bad time?
You didn't?
No, tell me.
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
Some other time.
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
Ronald?
I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.
First of all, maam, I never touched your daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines.
She's out.
Did you hit her?
That the old actress -- Julia Farren?
Does she go up to the Farren's often?
It's perfectly normal for a child to dream. I can see how a sensitive little girl, finding this portrait, would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend. That image dwells only in her imagination, and that image can go as quickly as it was born.
You get your wish!
Did your wishes ever come true?
The Farren house
She was very pretty.
Irena.
I know that.
It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
I thought you were with Amy.
Amy, make a wish.  Wish real hard, and then blow out the candles, and your wish will come true.
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
I shall wear it in my hair!
You?
Look at my ring.
the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
There was a deer on the other side of the fence.
But I only came to give back the ring.
I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
And does he kill people?
Hide me? Why?
Hurry!
You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.
But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
Amy looks happy — seems almost as if she were playing with another child; like somebody else were running with her and playing.
I know it may seem stupid of me--but it isn't the slap I'm worried about -- it's the reason.
No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend.
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
I'm lucky Jen's not like that.
Waiter! She needs more water.
Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?
How's the rest of your health?
And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
How have you been feeling?
You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.
My shrink says he's not so bad.
Maybe they have to pee.
And then?
He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up.
I wonder if he's married.
So where's this infamous arm now?
Hello?
Holy shit, I don't know.
There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
You expecting someone?
Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
"The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
What choice do we have?
I tried to kill myself -- earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I'm depressed I clean.
Hello?
I do development for TV movies.
You're kidding, really?
So there I was, hanging from the edge of a bridge, when my mom said, "Son, you got into Harvard!" It took three of them to pull me back! Frida keeps eating.
It's a matter of life and death.
The Nielson's?
Script coverage?
No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
We lived in northern Minnesota. She went for a walk one night and they never found her body -- just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them. Then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area.
A lot of people don't wear underwear.
What are they for?
What's wrong?
I mean we can still... whatever... Maybe I should get a towel?
Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.
Your breasts feel larger.
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
I'm going to take a shower.
No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.
So I asked the bartender what "coyote ugly" meant. It's like the "bagger" system. You know, a two- bagger -- someone so ugly that you need two bags -- one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off. Or a three-bagger...
He was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time.
I was thinking about becoming a cop myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up?
See he was cheating from the get go.
I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird.
Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?
Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead.
You think mafia hit?
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
What are you talking about?
What is this place?
Good evening, sir.
Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
Why do you want to speak to him?
Why give yourself up?
You see it?
A book of delusions.  Anything else?
No.  I, ah...
Water?
Your name is John White.
Known me for long?
What are you doing?
Why?
I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
Don't say a .
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
Mr. President...
That shelter was in this bill.
What do you think you're doing?!
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
It's a homeless shelter.
You're kidding.
What's with the cameras?
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
In fact, we think you did such a good job, we'd like to extend things a little bit.
Oh my God...
Will he be alright?
You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...
At a press conference.
I thought you said I wasn't going to see her.
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
Fine.
We've got to fix this.
Now he's making stuff up about me.
No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
Oh... Hi.
One day my wife says to me 'Why don't you try running for office.  You talk about it all the time, why don't you just do it?'  So I tell my boss I have a dentist appointment and I go down to the registrar of voters on my lunch break.  Next thing I know, I'm a councilman.
You're not?
You mean with you and everything?
But Bill was your king, not Bob.
That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
Where's home?
Are you hungry?
That's a secret.
Yes.
You know, secretaries and stiff.
Yeah.  Is that funny?
What's wrong?
I missed...
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
Please....shoot me.
After hanging up there a few days you will be mad for food...crazed! You will lust for it! YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM!
Help me get him to the boat.
Are you alright, Doc? You look... you look real bad.
Now I think Captain's punishment is fair, considerin'. In fact I think you ain't got shit ta complain about.
The man I was with...until today... believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth.
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys.
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!
I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the hospital...
But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them!
Prayers have no power to save. The knife can save. It can cut the disease away. The bullet. It can shatter the brain where the evil takes seed. These are saviours...our new saviours...our only saviours.
Dios mia.
TONY....TONY....
Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse.
You gave them a fresh taste of blood!
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
I can work here. Maybe my work can help...help everyone. I can do more good with access to this equipment than I can off in some wasteland.
No time for that. I'll take care of them.
Tricks...Jesus...
Well, I'd better find Patsy.  Say hello to Mutt for me.
How was dinner?
It will?  How do you figure?
Yeah.
What do you mean you don't know?
Well...
I hereby declare this the Charles Dalton Cave for Passionate Experimentation.  In the future, anyone wishing entry must have permission from me.
But what if they see it, Nuwanda?
Anything else you'd care to rifle through, Mr. Dalton?
You know what really excites me about you?
Yes sir.  We were just talking about that.
Todd's brother is Jeffrey Anderson.
Why don't you talk to Mr. Keating about it?
This is stupid.
Don't stop.
If Chet sees you, he'll kill you, don't you know that?
If they catch you here, we'll both be in big trouble.
Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-
Very good, Mr._?
And don't limit poetry to the word. Poetry can be found in a work of art, music, a photograph, in the way a meal is prepared--anything with the stuff of revelation in it.  It can exist in the most everyday things but it must never, never be ordinary  By all means, write about the sky or a girl's smile but when you do, let your poetry conjure up salvation day, doomsday, any day, I don't care, as long as it enlightens us, thrills us and--if it's inspired--makes us feel a bit immortal.
A yawp?
Use your imagination!  First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
Come on boys, don't be shy.
Why do you do it?  I mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something?
Mr. Keating, my father is making me quit the play at Henley Hall.  When I think about carpe diem and all that, I feel like I'm in prison!  I mean, I can see his point.  We're not a rich family like Charlie's.  But he's planned the rest of my life for me and he's never even asked me what I want!
Too bad.
All right!  What'd she say?
Wait a minute.  I don't let my parents walk on me.
You know what the dead poets would say: Gather ye rosebuds while ye may...
Any group pictures in the annual?
His grades are hurting, Charlie.
When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please.  Until then, you will listen to me.
I hear we're going to be roommates. Neil Perry.
From you?
You should come to rehearsals.  I know they need people to work the lights and stuff.
No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
Right here...middle of nowhere...
Right here...middle of nowhere...and the answer to your question is yes.
Where are my men?
Maybe we lost them.
Now look what you did!
What other bunch?
What are those things?
Seen a lot of islands?
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
Yeah you did...
Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal.
Let's just keep going.
Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
Joey... Which way's aft?
I mean...where is everbody?
What the hell does that mean?
Hey! What are you trying to pull!
Don't shoot, man, don't shoot!
She fucked you?
I'll get the boots.
Sweet! Oh, that is sweet!
And we want you to know, Sal, that any help you might need--
They did too!
It's gotta be the next one. I mean it's gotta be! Right, Albert?
What the --!
Did you ever think life would turn out like this?
I have to go.
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
You mean...?
You like to call me Linda now?
Hey, guys...
Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em!
Nick! Hey, Nick!  Boy! Boy oh boy! Are you okay? You're okay, huh?
Why?... What do you mean?... Why???
Please! Please mister, please! This is vital I go to Saigon. This is very important. Most important.
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --
What?
What kind of beer would you like?
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
You can do it, Sal.
Merle?
Sal!  Sal... Goddamn it, Sal, don't you know anything?
Pow?
It's ahead, by the tree.
Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
More bullets in the gun... The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other.
I did. I... This is stolen. I came back.
I like it, Nick.
No.
No.
What's that noise?
Where?
It's Merle, Sal.
Yeah.
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
What the hell's that for?
What the hell was that!  What did you think? Did you think it was loaded!
I think he wants more than your cookies.
You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
You can't kill me.  I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow.
You were planning to send me back to the ice house.  You set me up.
You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.
See those guys?
What's this place?
Yeah.
She's pretty.
No.  Talk English.  Then I'll understand.
Part of Doucet's cerebellum, a portion called the vermis is under- developed.  This area rates response to outside stimuli.  Com- pare it to that of a normal law- abiding citizen.  It could be why he kills.
You're not pregnant, are you?
Get us some fuck'n back-up now!
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
But he was such a good cop.
Let's dance together -- Belle.
Who are these people?
You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
Daniel! Don't ever let me catch you doing that again!
What's that, sir?
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
Lan's to goodness, what happened to that hen? Did you use that beanshooter again?
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
Say ... about the interest ...
Never mind. What's your name?
Mornin', Jabez ...
Do you deny that you called me? I've known people in other States who went back on their word. But I didn't expect it in New Hampshire.
Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you.
Where did it come from?
No, no! Give it to me!
Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
But -- I was just lucky.
Yes.
How much?
Down, Shep! Down!
I think his leg is broken.
You'll never change -- will you?
Mary --
You must go now, Mary -- you must!
You found it in the barn, hey?
Well -- that's comforting!  Supper.
Well, son, I'm glad to see a Stone come up in the world again.
I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all.
I want you to fix these fish!
Ma -- Ma -- it's all right, Ma!
I'll try hard -- I just can't take it all in.
What's that?
What are you looking for, Colonel?  What's your name?
Of course. And you tell your father for me -- we may be on opposite sides of the fence, but I'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions. As long as people do that -- the country's all right. Do you understand, Martin?
Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely --  Do you mind if I indulge?
Oh -- Mr. Webster -- I'm so glad you came!
I wanted to give it all to the church.
No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...
Argyle.  Don't you take this stuff?
What's happening?
John?  Christ, he could fuck this whole thing up...what does he think he's doing?
Where are you going?
Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
Hope I'm not interrupting...?
-- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance --
'Asian Dawn Movement?'
Better than being caught with your pants down, right?  John McClane.
How do you know?
Safe and sound, thanks to you. What the fuck was that?
Two.  And I'd sure like to see them swinging on the jungle gym with Al junior.
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --
Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --
Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
If you're right I'm gonna back you a hundred percent, you know that.
Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!
They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you.  I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you.
What guns?
Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up.
I don't know what I'm doing.
That's it.
I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped!
Denmark?  Sweden?
Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
I gotta listen to it if they think...
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
No!  They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
Yeah... I knew it.  But, what choice do I have?  I'm in the hospital; they drag me out of the hospital... bring me down here...
Well, you got to get hold of yourself.  You got to talk to him, tell him to give himself up.
Sonny-boy, one word?
I want a helicopter to get outa here!  And a jet to take us to...  ... wherever we want to go.  Outa the country, so no little jets.  A big one with a bar and a piano lounge.
He's totally unstable.  He'll make a mistake.
Hey... let him out!
Don't ask me questions.  I got connections.  You find out who I am, you're cold meat.
Where's the air conditioning?
I'll never see them again, Mister Mulvaney.
Thanks again, Sam.
It's up to you ladies.
Hey, girls -- I was on television...
When was the last time you saw Sal?
Did you always call him Junior.
Because I don't want cancer.
No!  I'm not kidding.  Don't you understand?  You're pure!
He's gone?
Where's the money?
It's the cops.  Shit!
You mean that?
We won't have to.
To show that we're negotiating.
I never been up in a plane before.
What?
Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
Fuck!  We did it!
Oh my God, mother!
For God's sake don't start in on Heidi again ...
Not now, Mom, please.
Did Pop come down?
What about, ah, non-union occupations?
Of course not ...
This is Bishop.
Alright. Time to ditch this thing. Did you take a look at the bathroom window?
Anything to get the fuck out of dodge.
Promise me... you won't ever tell Domino.
I'm so sorry to be bothering you in the middle of the night like this... but it's a bit of an emergency.
Your son... and your nephew have been kidnapped by these crazy game show hosts from the Fox network. <b> INT. CIGLIUTI COMPOUND -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Cigliuti sits up in bed.
Okay.
My armored car business. We just signed a new insurance policy in Nevada. There's a loophole.
Where are you? <b> INT. CHEVY SUBURBAN -- NEXT </b> Claremont is behind the Wheel of a BLACK CHEVY SUBURBAN. He pulls into the Texaco parking lot.
We need hostages. Celebrity hostages. Just in case this gets ugly. <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- LATER ON </b> The Cast Winnebago drives through the desert.
<i>The driver's name was Locus Fender. We know that he was in on the heist.</i> <b> INT. ARMORED CAR -- NEXT </b> LOCUS FENDER  is behind the wheel of the armored car. His unshaven, disheveled appearance looks totally out of place in his security uniform. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT </b> Taryn is now scrawling notes on a pad.
What was your business with Lateesha that day?
Is that you, Domino?
LOCUS! BABY... I'M HERE!
Everything. It is a ghastly existence.
You want to be a bounty hunter. Why does a pretty little thing like you want to be a bounty hunter?
Make us a pot of coffee, Edna.  It's gonna be a long night. <b> EXT. FENDER COMPOUND -- MOMENTS LATER </b> Edna stands next to her MAIMED SON near the burning barrels as they watch the Winnebago drive off into the desert. Locus is sobbing... latching onto his mother's sweater.
Three tours? Isn't that... <i>twelve years?</i>
This could break new ground in terms of traditional host models. It's self-reflexive reality television.
Fast and or furious.
I'll fuck you up quick two times.
I'm gonna leave now.
What did he do this time?
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
No, you the man.
It's so nice to see a family hanging out together.
What can you say?
The evil eye doesn't work on me.
I didn't know you had such beautiful hair.
Mookie.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
I think no such a thing.  Sal pays you, you should work.
I'll see you out.
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
Over Sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you.
C'mon, don't be shy.  Mmm, smells good.  This is ya Love Daddy talkin' to ya, starvin' like Marvin. Say something, Mookie.
You're raggedy as a roach.  You eat the holes out of donuts.
It's a fucking shame.
It's Miller time.  Let me go give these Koreans s'more business.
ML?
Hey!  What did I say?
You're right, a kid is dead, but Mook, this isn't the time.
Do we now?
Keep it.
Tina, what do you want me to do?
Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over there sometime today.
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
I've been working hard, getting paid.
Feels good.
Just coolin'.
You talk to 'em.
Smack him back.
Dago, wop, garlic-breath, guinea, pizza-slinging, spaghetti-bending, Vic Damone, Perry Como, Luciano Pavarotti, Sole Mio, nonsinging motherfucker.
Pino, I work hard like everybody in here.
Me and you are gonna have a talk.
Some are OK.
Hey!  Watch it.
Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?
You're gonna be in the street with the rest of your homeboys.
The both of youse, shaddup.
No, I'm not it.
I don't get it. Why'd you make him a pirate?
CHING CHONG, What happened to your beautiful Asian accent?
Hi.
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
HARRY!
Excuse me?
Would you like something to drink?
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
Just down the hall.
My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
Home school? What's that?
No no no no no.
...oh also, we even have a slogan. 'S' and 'P' stands for 'Special People', which is the kind of kids we are. 'A' and 'Z' is for 'Aren't Zeros' because that is less then one, and when you put it all together it spells...
Got any crazy eights?
No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand...
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
Whoa. What was that?
Your mom made a move on me.
What's with horse-boy, now he's a bright shiny sun?
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
You're it.
I don't know. Owwww.
Sure I do. On one condition.
Hey, where did you come from?
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones.
HARRY! I found the treasure!
George Washington!
Wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon. And now the reward.
You certainly did.
I... found that rock.
I have no idea - it's full of files and documents and tapes.
What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
Oh, good. There's Jessica.
Ya know Harry, I think this whole experience has soured me on women.
What?
TURK, what are you doing here?
Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain.
So, when can we do it?
Well, something stinks.
Well I need to get a job and you're telling me that if I join up - I can really come and go whenever I want?
Sure.
Yeah, deal. Give me the two dollars.
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
How was that?
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
Sorry, Ms. Heller. I think they're used to me teaching.
Let's go Margie. The museum ain't going to teach itself.
That's great, now make a left, then straight!
No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class.
Guess what"s under these coconuts.
You got the Extender?
What happens now?
Yes, my Lord.
You must share with us. -- EMPEROR The Atreides house is building a secret army!... using a technique unknown to us... a technique involving sound. The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice... thus replacing their enemies the Harkonnens.... House Atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides... I have promised the Baron five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops.
Don't you trust your own eyes.
Sayyadina.  Our Reverend Mother tells me she is too old... She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest.  She asks that you pass within.
He knows.
Are you a Fremen?
Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
We call that one Muad'dib.
The Voice again.
 I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
I sense your teachings in him. Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice.
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.
Eddie, where are we?  We passed that carwash twenty minutes ago.
Of course!  Well, we got a big day planned for you... First, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there.  Then, once you're up to speed and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment --
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
What's in the needle?
Bela, don't worry.  You're better than all this crap.
What is this place?
It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.
Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
Do you know I turned down "Frankenstein"?
Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
Eddie, this is quite a scene.
Last night was quite a romp.
You really think so?
No!  He's very alive.  Well... sort of.  He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi!  And he's really nice.
Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
I'm no good.
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
That's right...
I'm tired of living on the fringe.
Pleased to meet you.  I'm Loretta King.
Eddie, which dress do you like better?
Really?!  Well good for you.
Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.
Yeah...?
Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.
"Graverobbers From Outer Space"! It's <u>money in the bank</u>.
Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
Could we moovf to table?
Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.
So anyway, I've got this new script, "Bride Of The Atom," and there's a part you're ideal for: "Lobo."  He's tough.  A brute.  But he has a heart -- and at the end he saves the girl.
I can't believe it.  These sound like <u>my</u> problems!
Well, Mr. Weiss, I've never told anyone what I'm about to tell you... but I really want this job.  I like to dress in women's clothing.
Nah, I'm all man.  I even fought in WW2.  'Course, I <u>was</u> wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.
Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
Georgie, what's with the stag footage??  You said you were cutting in <u>establishing shots</u>!
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw.  Your friend's.
Kathy, I'm about to tell you something I've never told any girl on a first date.  But I think it's important that you know.  I like to wear women's clothes.
Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?
What was that?
No, BIGGER!  What's the biggest energy??
The set doesn't look right!  It looks too... empty.  Clutter it up.  Put a skeleton in the corner.  And what's that thing over there?
Wow, this lab looks great.  Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?
I thought this was a group effort.
Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
Vampira!  Hi, this is Ed Wood.
No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?
No. The bathroom is off limits -and when I go to sleep they go to other programming. Unless I get up. Then they go back on the air. Unless I get up to go to the bathroom, I guess, then -
What do you love her or something?
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
Now look. Don't freeze up on me. I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You're not going to lose that, are you?
Yeah.
Take him off the air.
According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
Are the TV people with you?
Hey, he cheated on her.
I don't want to -- do you know where he is?
Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
I mean, that worked out.
What happened?
Who?
To you? In front of him?  With the...
Right, yeah --
Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?
What are you doing?
Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
Um, yeah, I was gonna ...
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
Really?
Oh God, this is so weird.
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
You know, the big machine that cleans the ice.
I have no privacy. Even now! I'm crying and I can't stop and they won't go away. And now it's going to be another month!
Everybody hates me!
I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
I'm sorry.
I feel like a criminal or, like we're cheating on someone.
She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. No. Not in my house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - "How do they find me" she says. Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... Oh, man... Are you all right?
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
This is going right up your ass.
You weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any  man, I admit -- and my problem is, if I think I'm losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told you, I'm the love coroner.
Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
Why do you do that?
I mean my question is what was she doing in a bar in the first place?
Hi.
Hello... Shari, hi... Oh no! ... Oh God!
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
Oh, man, I've been trying to call you.
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
Ray, where do you keep the glasses?
Yeah? That's good. Sorry is good. You know I finished that model.
That girl's an idiot.
Oh!!
Mm.
I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?  I know what --
One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.
what?
Around that time Diane and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time.
What d'you got?
You know what they say about the early bird.
Here they are.
Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
You know, Mr. M., when I win the presidency, that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year.  And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you?
A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.
I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.
I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy. You have many admirable qualities.  But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that.  And in the end, you're only cheating yourself.
What do you mean?
Handles pretty good, don't you think?
Why are you doing this?
I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel ready for college.
I hope so
Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house.
Hey Yeah?
Paul, I know you've been pretty down since your accident.
253... 254... 255. I get the same as you Jim. Looks like Paul's our president.
Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy.
Where 're you going?
But other people can see them too.
We can't both run, can we?  We're brother and sister.  Can we?
Who put you up to this?
Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.
I just thought, well, last time you got suspended you fell so behind and -
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
Can I get you a drink?
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
How'd she meet Patchett?
We talked.
He helped me out once.  That's all.
You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell.  You're not your old, cruel self anymore.  I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp.
Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
Maybe.  I don't know.
What's through here?
Was it... a rat?
Yeah, that's Stens.
A naked guy with a gun?  You expect anyone to believe that?
I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other.  Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The night I met Lynn.  Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them.
Dudley's guys.
She's fine.
Are you Pierce Patchett?
Richard Stensland.
Thanks, but no thanks.
No.
Should I?
What do you want to know?
Ed, your observations have been astute.  What's your assessment of this situation?
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships.
And?
Why?
Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  Through his whore girl friend.  I sent him to make the buy.  The rest is history.
Yeah, Exley.  What's the payoff?
You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
Even I'm not that crazy.
It's a simple question.
Is there more to that, or do I have to guess?
I'm trying to figure what angle you're playing <u>this</u> time, but I sure as hell can't see one.
Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
She is Lana Turner.
What are you talking about?
For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
Why do men and women usually see each other?
Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?  He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results.  But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down.
How was I?
I'll take your word for it.
Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier?
No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
Where will you go?
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
Jack!  It's Christmas!
Sid, why would a guy like Pierce Patchett get involved with running dope and hookers?
What'd he give to you?
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
I just gave him my card.
Um...who's that?
209 to anyone! I need some help here!
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
Zavitz, what? You want your old job back?
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
Okay.
I don't know what that means.
How many years have <u>you</u> been hiding from them? How many years have you been running?  What'd they do to you?
I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.
What'd I tell you?
They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.
Well, actually, <u>you</u> have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.
Them.
In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
Drive.
We're gonna lead Albert by the nose to one conclusion. And then when he's pissed as hell, we're gonna drop the tape in his lap. How fast can you teach me what I need to know?
Pretty fast.
What are you dialing?
Who's calling?
The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but--
Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker.
Do you see anything you like?
You'd like to buy your wife some lingerie as a Christmas gift.
How 'bout Christian Dior?
What size?
For that matter, I think you will too.
I know, but--
No, sir, I'm not involved with that. I'm doing a quick follow-up on a bus accident took place a few nights ago. Your name keeps coming up.
Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before he died. I thought you might know something.
Than why can't you tell me.
So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?
You're a lawyer. Don't you care what's going on around you?
Sorry.
I don't understand why Jerry couldn't clear this up.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
I'm sorry about Rachel.
Who?
That ain't me.
You don't know who the fuck--
"Soon". Or at least sooner than never.
Thank you.
I went through this with an investigator this morning. If I could--
He didn't.
You're wrong.
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
They claim you helped create a shell company for Sam Vollotti in Zurich and that through your continuing relationship, the Gambino family's been able to exert influence and provide false witnesses to discredit our case.
Because they've been paid off by Bellmoth.
You're learning a cruel lesson.
In your dreams.
Who won the fight?
It's okay to use the phone.
Why don't you give 'em a call.
What?
The Congressman's very happy to have your support, but he's heard that there's an investigation.
You gotta--
Bobby? Piece of advice?
I sit on top of the greatest intelligence gathering organization in human history. Why can't I bring in a man whose name <i>is in the</i> <i><u>fucking</i></u> <i><u>phonebook</i></u>?!
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
How'd you get in the building?
Yes?
I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this.  I apologize if I appear abrupt.  I am rusty at social graces.  How do you find Cairo?  Did you visit the Pyramids?
After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
Actually, you sing.
What's this?
You should come into the shelter.
- there is the Harmattan, a red wind. Which Mariners called the sea of darkness.  Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood. Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.
Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
Arabic?
Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!
Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.
Why did you hate me?
Don't leave me!
Why do they care about our maps?
Had a letter from my wife.  The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to.  She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever.  Wrong coast I should have thought, still…
Hey!  Hey!  Stop this jeep!  Let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!
What do you want?
Buon' giorno.
Hello.
Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression.
What did you say?
You get to the morning and the poison leaks away, doesn't it? Black nights, fucking black nights, when you want to howl like a dog. I thought I would kill you.  You killed my friends, you ruined my hands.  But the girl was always here, like some Guardian Angel.
Right.
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
Marvelous plane.  Did you look?
Could I have a cigarette?
There's meant to be lace in the next village - the boys are taking me.
Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door.
When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
It's not safe here.  The whole country's crawling with Bandits and Germans and God knows what.  It's madness.  I can't allow it. You're not, this is natural - it's shock. For all of us.  Hana -
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
I'll come with you.
They're excited!  They're happy about destroying a whole city. Would they do that to a White Man's City?  Never!
What about your rank or serial number?
You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
Gin? Where the hell are you?
Are you...okay?
Like I would have art in my suitcase.
Are you under the impression that now I'm in some way obligated to you?
But Roki said--
You want me to pick up a painting?
It's a test.
I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake.
We're going to die, aren't we...
What about your bags?
And--
Nice spot.
I know it well.
Only a week?
I go in alone.
I'll need that.
On what? Another job?
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
You bought this for me?
Thank you.
Won't take any time.
Ready?
Can you see the other PIRs?
The big job.
No, really, it's your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent--
You've got everything planned.
The Mask. Where is it?
What about the rules?
Peoples China Bank.
The oscilloscope's already programmed.
How do I look?
Pulse detectors.
Don't panic, now, there's no rush...
Hang on.
Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.
They've been on to you all along. Knew you had a big job going.
I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.
I said a masked ball, not a costume party.
You better not be taking on a new partner.
She's calling the shots now.
You better be keeping your mind on business. It's not just me you got to worry about. I've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
Thirty-five next generation microchips. Copper, not silicon. Value: one million each.
Call it an expression of trust.
The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality.
Where've you been?
His dry cleaners.  You want him?
Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.
Whoa.  Remind me.
I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor.  Jesus.  Look at me. What do I have this afternoon?
There's more than one?
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
Cause of the chromium.
What's chromium?
Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick.
Sure wish I had longer to get used to the idea.  You think if you got no uterus, and no breasts, you're still technically a woman?
You wouldn't happen to have a little time right now, would you, Donna?
I don't even know how much money that is.
And get someone to help around the house.
You're a girl.
So what's the story on this thing?  This cancer stuff?
I didn't see any medical records in there.
Okay.  A 5% raise, and --
And this shit is bad news, Mr. Masry.  Not only does it attack every organ of the body, it fucks with your DNA, too.  That means these people's genes, and the genes of their kids, and the genes of their grandkids --
They used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive.  Then they dumped it here, in these six ponds.
Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here.  This is some damn good work.
Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.
Hey.  A new plaintiff called, wants to meet you.  I told him we'd be out there Thursday.
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
I was just asking.  Are you all right?
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
Counts?
Why good?
If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your fucking head off --
You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --
Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --
I was wrong.
Nope.  And I didn't ask.
And you were told to destroy those?
You know what, Erin?  I got nothing but time here.  Why don't you let me do that for you, and you can get your kids some dinner.
Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.
Mommy, can I get a flower?
Look, I know you're mad.  But the way this job is, things come up at the last minute, real important things, and I gotta deal with them.  Now I don't like me missing dinner any more than you do, but we're all gonna have to get used to it, cause the fact is, it's gonna happen sometimes.
PG& -- Are you sure?
Randy's mom said yes right away.
Well, hello to you, darlin'.
Just introducing myself to the neighbors.
You want my number?
Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
What're you doing?
You're not nothing, Erin.
If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.
I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road.  Keep me awake, willya?
No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me about your day.  What went on back there?
I'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?
You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick.
What?
There's something else, too.
I know.  It's an awful lot.
It'll be fine, yeah.
Dr. Paulsen?
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
Oh.  Oh.
Uh-huh.  Spent the last few days knocking on doors.  And you know what?  They're not.  I mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff.  And their pets are fine.  So I don't know -- I just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water.
Soon, Lord Vader.
He'll learn.
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
... Luke, you must not go.
Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
Well, it's been awhile.
Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.
Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
Whatever it is, it isn't friendly. I'm going to have a look.  Come on, Chewie.
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
Yes, Your Highness?
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ....
You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.
That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
You don't look angry.
Are you crazy!
Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.
You could have warned him before you shut him off.
That depends.  Where are we?
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?
We've got to find Luke.
No argument, just do it.  That's a command!
Where are you going?
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there?  How's Luke?
Ready are you?  What know you of ready?  I have trained Jedi for 800 years.  My own counsel I'll keep on who is to be trained.
Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.
Four this time!  The Force you feel.
The fear does not reach you.  You have learned more than I anticipated.
Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.
So am I.  And I mean you no harm.
We shall want a full autopsy ...
Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how.
L.A. is in a constant state of warfare. Gangs fighting for the right to rule.
Who's that?
Give it.
It's so good to see you again.
He's... near.
Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?
I was called away on urgent business, Snake.
Shut up, Plissken.
Third World wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want. The Cubans and Brazilians are ready to invade Miami. If the Africans and Colombians make a run at the border, we got a full scale attack on the United States.
Where do I put ashore?
Getting ready to invade.
The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President.  Shall I begin evacuation?
Aw, come on, Snake.
Is that what I think it is?
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.
What are they?
How do we get out of here?
I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going.
All of us?
When you threw it in, what did you see?
Merlin, will I live...?  ...I was dreaming...
It is whispered in the forest that...  ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens.
I should have left you to fend for yourself.
The very spear that pierced the side of Christ as he died on the cross.
I cannot offer you the land, only my love...
I will muster a great force of knights, and I will return to fight for what is mine.
I left it in the tent, sir.
Why?
There are things about love--
What honey?
Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
Oh Burke! Poor Burke!
May I ask...?
I lied. It's for me. The spelling is on the back, Kinderman. You know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that six times.
Yeah or maybe rats now will you just get those traps.
Bastard! I will kill you.
Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?
Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day.
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
Well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter-
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
Are you sure?
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
Where?
To begin with it could make things worse.
No, you don't understand. Your daughter-
I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
No, is Regan aware of it?
Where?
You really don't want me to play huh?
Captain Howdy, Do you think my mom's pretty? Captain Howdy? Captain Howdy that isn't very nice.
I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?
Well your thinking's not so good.
There haven't been more than a hundred authenticated cases of so- called split personality, Mrs. MacNeil. Now I know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry, but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first.
Think you can sleep?
Goodnight Dims.
Another one. Had your lunch?
You'd like that?
Do it again.
Quod nomen mihi est?
What's that?
I'm all right.
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
No.
And also with you.
Can you give her something?
Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?
Really?
Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards.
It's possible. Possible however…
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.
No, I mentioned it only in passing.
I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...!
...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell!
Frankie.
Yeah, come on in.
Maybe next time.
Start him out on cottage cheese. If you've got him on kibble, just soak it a few minutes.  Go down like pudding through a hot pipe.
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
Twenty years, Ma ...
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
What's wrong with it?
That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack?
Cindy.
What d'ya got?,
Your older brother.
Yeah?
No?
Sure, why not.
It's more like 40-60, wouldn't you say?
What's that?
Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.
Jack.
Make it collect.
Hey, Frank.
You want to come out to the house tomorrow? The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided to really lay it on.  Turkey, stuffing, the whole bit.  Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move.  We could use another appetite.
He's drunk.
I figure that way we won't get confused.
We might as well do the towels the same way.
You leaving that on?
All night?
Accommodate?  I don't think I know what you mean.
What's the matter with you?
How dare you say you love me.
How's it coming?
How long you been at it?
He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
God, the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he?
What?
Be reasonable, Jack.
What's it for?
What disease?
What channels it on?
Stay off it.
Jack!
Yeah, fine.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
A seven.
Nine.
What do you think?
They're tight.
We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors?  Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ...
We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
You two could play checkers.
You play all these places?
Great?
Peggy Lee?
I can't sing it anymore.
Tom here tells me there's a problem with the pianos.  We were assured they were in tune.
Funny hours.
Right.  Bring him back.
Where's egghead?
He takes after our mother.
He do that every year?
What'd I say?
All I said was you were good.
Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.
Soap convention.
By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?
Let me get the light.
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
Guess they're up.
Ivory.
From Hurley's?
John.  It's good to see you.
How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
Where am I?
And this thing can grow it?
Why would he need more?
Hey, bro ...
What do you mean?
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
Is someone there?
Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --
Christ, Jon!  How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us?  Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
This is it, Jon.  For the next 72 hours -- you're on your own.
You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
What's it to you?  I declare it.  Here I am, back in the States for less than a month --
-- Castor?
I don't know.  How long before it kills us?
You better be nice, Castor. You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone.
Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.
We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out.
Get a higher arc on the ball, Jamie.  And for Chrissake, square your shoulders to the basket.
What are you -- stupid?
Commander, what are you doing here?
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
You merciless bastard!
-- I'll be one of the most powerful men in the country. Didn't matter how much cash I made pulling wet jobs -- I was still too low on the food chain -- always with somebody like Jon Archer after me.  The best part is -- I'm the GOOD guy.
All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.
I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
As much as ever.  Nothing.
The hospital.
Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
You always say that -- then you leave.
-- Yes.
I'll deal with her later.
I'm going to the powder room.
Remember this from our junior prom?  Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna.
You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?
Mr. Mintz.
You have kids, Jack?
Take you, for instance...
We’re almost done here...
Very nice. What is it?
What are you doing?
We’re friends, aren’t we?
Where’s your follow through?  Where’s your stance?
She is relentless.
DO YOU WANNA DIE?!
Yes you do...
Yeah?  What do you need?
Figure it out.  You got plenty of time.
As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
I’ve got kids, I’m going home...
What're you talkin' about?
Mushroom puffs aren’t the only thing I do well...
Evelyn, right?
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.
I don’t care who you are.  It’s Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
That’s the kind of thing you can really build on...
Here we are, mag wheels...  Hey Jack, are you sure you’re okay?
Sorry, pal.  Entrance is for residents and guests only...
Go. I’m sorry, you should just go...
Where were you?
What are you doing?
Jack...
She’s your dog, Jack.
How can you do that?
I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if I’m lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere?  I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...I’m sick of it.
Well...Annie for one.
I think it worked out okay, don’t you?
How was the game, honey?
C’mon.
You want the cake!?
I found it at an outlet store.  I know it’s a knock-off, but I think it’ll look great on you...
Here’s the thing.  I really hadn’t planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.  You know, anniversary’s good all day...
I never used to be like this, Kate.  I had it all figured out.  No doubts, no regrets.
I think it’s good to be a little unsure about who you are.  It’s very human.
Good things...
I can’t believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didn’t want to raise the kids here?
I can do that.  I want to do that.  For all of us. I need to do that as a man...  Think about it.  No more lousy restaurants, no more clipping coupons, no more shoveling snow...
You look great.
Please. Let’s just go have a cup of coffee. That’s all I’m asking for. I’m sure there’s another flight to Paris tonight.
Don’t do this, Jack... But he continues...
...we’re really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.
I’ll go for a cup of coffee!
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
How'd you know it was me?
Ben --
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative...
Back it down, Johnny!
You need to control yourself and <u>think</u> before you --
You're on fire!
Apparently I can disappear.
I'm driving.
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
Leonard, how's the feed?
We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  We need to abort.
Well, uh, based on our history...you can handle the biogenetics, and I'll focus on the molecular physics.  Or, uhm, maybe I should take the biotech, you work the microscopes, since you have some background in electropho--
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules.  I've been working on a formula for this.
Feeling better?
For science.
It has to be the cloud.  It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field.  That's what you projected on the Bridge.
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
Reed.  I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
Reed.  How close are we to a cure?
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
I found a broken gasket, from space --
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
What are you doing?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
Victor, your scar --
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Where do we stand?
Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.
What is it?
What're you getting at?
But why take the chance, when there must be other doctors?
Yes, we'd like to get moving.
Yes, Alan.
Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
A long time, with one man.
If you had a transistor about this size and power output, and a thin enough wire --  -- could you piece it together?
What can we do?
The Soul? The finite mind cannot comprehend Infinity. And the Soul which comes from God is Infinite.
The Medieval Philosophers were right... <Man> is the center of the Universe... We stand in the middle of Infinity, between Outer and Inner Space. And there's no limit to either.
I'd hate to get lost on that Freeway...
We'll never get there in time, at this rate.
"Yet all the suns that light the Corridors of the Universe shine dim, Before the blazing of a Single Thought -- "
You said there was a quick way out!
Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant.
About forty miles an hour.
In a way -- yes. Those are impurities imbedded in the Lung after a lifetime of 'Civilization.' Carbon from smoke and smog -- specks of dust --
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
Looks like the sea, at dawn.
I'm in charge of this mission! You were instructed to take orders from me, not give them!
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
Out of your element, aren't you, Captain?
Atomic fuel?
Any reserve air?
Thirty-two minutes left...  But chances are we won't have to wait that long for try-number three.
That's it...
Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!
This is a new car, then, sir?
Can I see your license and registration please?
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
Or your fucking wife, you know.
...Come on, man. Okay, here's an idea. We'll stop outside of Brainerd. I know a place there we can get laid. Wuddya think?
Huh?
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
Well, okay, it's -
Yah. But it's not a whole pay-in- advance deal. I give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and -
Three people. In Brainerd.
That's right. And we need more money.
Yah, I got the money, but, uh -
We sat here right in this room and went over this and over this!
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
Ah, well, we haven't had to run around like you. When're you due?
Oh, don't be silly.
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
Oh sure. They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
Where you girls from?
...What's the big deal? It's an hour -
The financials are pretty thorough, so the only thing we don't know is your fee.
Wade's got a point there. I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry.
It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any.  These men, they just want money, see.
...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
Yah.
Yah.
Stan and I're okay.
Well, a course they're gonna say that! But where's my protection? They got Jean here! I give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go.
You're darned tootin'!
Yah, well, see, I did that, and I haven't been able to get 'em, so I thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya.
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
Ya see something down there, Chief?
Somebody shut his lights. I guess the little guy sat in there, waitin' for his buddy t'come back.
You were such a super lady...  and then I... I been so lonely...
No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back up to Brainerd.
Linda.
Oh. Oh, my.
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
...Chief Gunderson?
Not on your feet too much?
They announced it?
...So?
Uh-huh.
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
That wouldn't interest you.
You are a moron.
Hmm?
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
We need to talk.
Let's pretend.  You're the Department of Transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects?  Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles.  Fuel injectors that burn people alive.
The dynamite...
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
Why are you doing this?
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
We'll split up the week.  You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
It's time for you to leave.
What are you talking about?
Here.
You feel nothing?
Uh ... nah.
Is that what you're calling it?
You fuck me, then snub me.  You love me, you hate me.  You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole!  Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?
Say my name.
Marla...
I'm trying to tell you -- and this is where you have to trust me -- but, I think your life might be in real danger.
Let go of me!
Why are you doing this?
What happened... ?
-- But, in here, in everyone, there's the squint of a five-day headache. Yet they forced themselves to be positive.  They never said "parasite;" they said "agent."  They always talked about getting better.
Thank you.
I guess so.
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered.
Don't I?
No, I...
What?
They're called "cigarette burns."
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
I don't know about this.
A guy came to fight club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough.  After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.
Hemingway.  You?
She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
Promise you won't.
Huh?
Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
Listen to me.  You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you.  In all probability, He hates you.  This is not the worst thing that can happen...
What... ?
Something on your mind?
What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.  We are all part of the same compost heap...
I'm not asking you to.
I don't know!  Nothing!
I want to hear the truth.
You're too young.  Sorry.
Why did you do that?
Why do people think anything?
No!  This isn't true.  We... we were around other people, together, both of us...
Bob was a grown man.  In any great struggle, there will be casualties. Wouldn't that be implicit in the name?  Project "Mayhem."
You want out?
Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!
Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A.  A small, cramped basement apartment.
Animals.
It's not just about me.  Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident.  What if the others are in danger, too?
What list?
You have to tell us now.
Please, what else could it mean?
What are you doing?  You're going to kill us!
What do you want me to do?
So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be alive in the first place.
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
You've made your point.
Are you Jorge Cruz?
This can't be happening.  My career's at a peak, I finally met a cute guy, I just bought a new house...
Kalarjian?
But it's over.  Isabella's baby was the key.  You saw her die and everything, right?
I know this is the first time we've been apart since.  But everything's gonna be okay.
Your mother would have been so proud of the way you've handled yourself through all of this...
What on Earth are they doing?
You're all certifiable, you know that?  I can't believe I've been listening to this crap.  Come on, Tim, let's go outside.
You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits.
That's why I was there last night.
This place?!
I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.
We're losing our favorite teacher.
Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?
I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it...
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
Alex... can you promise me that no one else will die?
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
You guys are real... aren't you?
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
Ever do this from a jet?
Co Phuong Bao.  The guide takes us twelve klicks upriver to target at Ban... at Ban... Bo Peep.  Shit!
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ.
You wanna know why I stood up for this show?
I was in the brig.  They gave me a deal.  I blew up this Colonel's golf cart with an M-19.  He wasn't in it or anything... it was the symbolic value.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.
I've seen worse places.
Brewer.  Does a jet make noise?
What's she saying?
Roundeye.
That guy's not going to make it.
How do we get upriver?
He's giving them a run for their money.  Says here they've got two Hueys from Danang.  I didn't know those dinks had Hueys.
Typical...
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
Black.  No sugar.
I know...
But you're right... some people do get sacrificed.  Now tell me why you pulled the plug.
So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?
Hello, John.
We left some people behind there, John... POWs.
Let's do it.
You know, I think I... ordered some just the other day.
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
...So he says to me, "you'll never find another man like me"...I said, "please, men like you have one hand on their dicks and the other hand on their mother's leg... I said, there's the door - take a trip.
Holdin' my penis... What a lovely way of sayin' how Much ya like me...
... So... where did you sleep last night?
... You have a little... uh... something on your face...
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
See, I told you!
I've got to put these tapes in some kind of order... and... Oh, I should get my sports jacket cleaned...  ... There's coffee if you want...
No.
Well!  What do you want me to do - applaud?
So, Edwin, baby, this is Sunrise Confession time... what have you got for us?
Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?
I wanna go...Just let me go...
Come on now...You can't sit here.
About dinner as a concept or about dinner with...  <u>Raoul</u>?
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
Huh-huh.
The Holy Grail?  Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?
Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness.
It's such a great song.
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
Beautiful night huh?
...I..uh..I get to read some of the books but mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. After paperback it's basically someone else's problem.
What do you do - for a living I mean?
What are we about to do?
I don't drink coffee...
See, I told you it was him...  Your name's Donnie something, right?
Give 'em the horn, Bob.
Sugar, you know how I feel about you, don't you? I'm just tryin' to get you to take an interest in my kind a things, an' what I'm tryin' to do with myself...  You know, there id'n anything in the world I wouldn't do for you, baby. I started livin' the day I found you, you know that?
You know what, you are never satisfied.
Come on.
I'm gonna go in that cafe an' get some coffee. You want anything?
No substitutions.
We been wantin' to ask you something. Are you the guy on YV?
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
But what about me?
Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
Why?
No, it isn't what I think.
No, don't do that...
No, I can't...
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
That'll make you happy.
Four or five years.
I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...
See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?
That's three games to none, Carl.
No, I wouldn't.
Come on, Terry, we got a ride!
Not now, I'm busy
For once in your life have some 	respect for me, don't even curse at me or nothin'.
Alright, tell me, what'd you hear?
What are you doin' here?
Whadja wanna see me about?
That's it?
See, I got you, you are so scared. I don't believe that you kissed no girls. That you got three girls and that you faithful and this and that.
Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good?
Come down!
Probably.  One of the many.
You wanna do somethin' with me?
You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
Fletch F. Fletch
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?
No children?
Right.
Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
Like when?
Until she remarries, Fletch.
Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.
Isn't that nice. Since when?
Lets see, it was before he moved to L.A... four years April.
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
That's Brazil.
Because we can't.
So why pick me?
Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.
Only if you promise not to return me.
'Magic' today, huh?
W-Y-K no 'c.' I'll be down in a minute.
I overheard it. He thinks you're completely out of control, he said he was gonna can you as soon as he got the story. If I were you, I'd just chuck it, Fletch. Screw him. Let him eat three full pages on Sunday.
Cute young thing, too.
We used to fly together. I'm... John.
Who is it?
You ordered it here?
So?
What are you talking about?
No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...
No.
Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
One.
I would, actually.
Muchas gracias.
Where is she?
I never read the paper.
Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it.
I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
Who's Frieda?
Yes?
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
Now that we've broken the ice...
Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs.  Why didn't you jump on her?  What's happening to you?
You're saying you need money.
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
I'm sorry, that dress.  What do you say we...
What did you... Hey, where's your spex?
I came to warn you...
Hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits.  This one is putting out low bits.  The data is in some fucked binary system.  The two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc.  Comprendo?
Zuzu Petals!  Zuzu Petals!  Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit?  Who killed Johnny Crunch?  Why do people want you so goddamn bad?
Because I know rock-n-roll.
Are you okay?
This is boring, guys.
I'm afraid so, you want her?
Pretty smooth, huh?
I tried to help you...!
So, did you find my dad?
Two words.  Disco Express.
'Booty Time.'
'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
Polo.
What's fine?
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
I knew your father.  He was quite...
Well, hello, Ford.
It doesn't have to be like this?
You're that guy, the private eye.
'Bye, Johnny...
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Man, I'm clean.
I got no music!
Where's he from?
Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit.
That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in the subway and you blew our cover. If they haven't moved already they're not gonna move now.
Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb guinea.
Never trust a nigger.
If that's not a drop or a pickup, I'll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.
Toy wit' this will ya.
We got information that there's no shit in the street -- it's like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming in to make everybody well.
The guy's a frog -- I'm pretty sure. Also he made me.  Stayin' on four but went up to six -- cute.
This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop.
Can you use a new suit for Christmans?
Where'd you get this fag shit?
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
That was over thirty years ago.  I paid for that and then some.
Oh, my God!  What is that?!  Why you showing me this shit!?  JESUS!  JESUS! Get those away from me!
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
How do we get to the vault door?
You okay, man?
How about a little of the King?
What's the matter, Jules?  Trouble workin' an eight hour shift, watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese?
Where's Johnny?
What is going on here, Satch?  What are those guys doing out there?
What if I could prove it to you, Satch?
What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.
In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.
Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?
29 years...?
What the hell...
What's going on?
Oh my god.
How could this be happening?
You're still my Little Chief, right?
Why?
Dad, I gotta tell you this...cause you should know.  Cause I still remember.
When?
I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.
What are we like in...1998?
You all right?
He killed her John.  He killed her and I didn't do a thing to stop it.
I'm here, Dad.  I'm here.
I'm not your uncle, kid.  Gordo, what are you doing here?
C'mon, man.  Get inside.  I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo.
Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.
I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970.  Eight days after the last Nightingale murder.
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
My name is Abel.  And I am my brother's keeper.
Who brought up this bright idea?
What're you doin'?
I'm a slow eater.
Maybe we should do some exercise.
Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
Come on down!
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
I don't know.
This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?
Look what I found.  Remember these?
Could we move a little faster?
That scarecrow?  Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.
Is... is everything all right?
Please... be cool.
If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
What it is?
Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
It's all over.
You know what?  Sissy and Cort are playing jokes.  You know, trying to scare each other.
That's debatable.
Now you better cool out a minute, boy.  You already almost got your head blown to pieces.
Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were....
No problem, Rick.  Come over and meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis.  He's got some kinda prank going about...
I gotta show you Jason's grave.
With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.
Jason Voorhees is dead.
Good night, beautiful.
Maybe you should be moving on.
You're talking about my lady.
Does he know about what happened?
Jesus, Steven, that's...that's really lovely.
Randy, c'mon!
Wanna know how I did that?
Don't do anything stupid.
I've told you the truth.
Look, I know I treated her bad --
You call what you did bad?!  You knocked her up and then left her!
I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.
A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll narc on us...
Tell me.
Dear Christ...
What are you doing in here?
Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?
I doubt very much that one even exists.
What a beautiful day.
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.
Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
Rennie -- I was just on my way over to your room
I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  In other words, level with me.
I can't swim.
I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me.  I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since.
The Captain and Chief Engineer... they've been...they're dead.
Yes...
I heard you weren't coming.
It's okay...you're going to be okay.
Can he really take us home?
Rennie...??
But Rennie...
I used to drive a taxi.
We must abandon.
Elliot?
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
I'm not ready.
I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.
We're making too much of this.
In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.
He'll hate it.
This could be it.
Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
Because we're completely mismatched.
It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel.
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
What else?
I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself.
What do we want?
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
It's Stanley. It's the Steamer. Fate has spoken to this man in the depths of the night.
This could be it!
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.
If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.
aybe we ought to postpone the opening.
'm not worried about this kid.
Sidney remains optimistic.
Yes.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?
Home.
You've come to me. I wanted to believe you would one day.
Here, you see? Even the South African papers apologize -- "a monstrous attack."
It is the work of untouchables.
God gave you ten thumbs.
They're calling you "Bapu." I thought it meant father.
You mean Gandhi?
Well, it's quite a place, your "ashram" -- is that right?
You've done me a great service.
I'm sure I'm fit for at least five hundred miles.
You mean a general strike?
It must have been the only Non-violent campaign ever led by a man who wanted to kill everybody every day.
You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney, but you can't walk down the street with him?
Bapu, for me, and the rest,  if that is what you want, we will accept it. But out there  already there is rioting because Hindus fear you are going to give too much away.
In Calcutta it's like civil war. The Muslims rose and there was a bloodbath, and now the Hindus are taking revenge -- and if we can't stop it there'll be no hope for the Hindus left in Pakistan.
The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.
How often do you test, Director?
What about this?
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
Not thirsty?  We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
Where are you taking her?
Everybody goes there.
By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you?"
Why have you done this?
Where are you going?
First, we may as well decide on gender. Have you given it any thought?
What will happen to the others?
You can wear lifts.
I envy you, Jerome.
What <i>is</i> this place?
Why are we leaving?
My medication.  I left it back there.
What about them?
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...
Sure,  You're working on the passports...  ... and visas?
I'll take care of my end.
Three... Rudy got ambitious.
Hello, Doc.
What's Beynon got set up?
What do you want for dinner?
How does it taste?
I guess I'm kind of...
I was going to fix you breakfast.
Thanks again.  I 'm glad you waited.
Why are you laughing?
That doesn't hurt.
You know how I feel?
Promise you won't laugh.
You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
So what. I've got to give him his money. That was our end of the deal.
Do you trust him?
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
Your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in Huntsville.
I'll bet you can.
Okay?
We got this far.
Sounds good.
Okay.
No, I'm not.
All right. Shells?
Yeah. I got out.
Suit yourself.
What do you have in mind?
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
Come on. How much?
That's what I want.
You do what he says, Harold.
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
Well, he drove it into the river.
She's nothing to do with me.
Though nicer than most?
I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?
Yes.
Yes. I met him last year.
Could you do me a favour?
Who's setting you up in this place?
Was it Albert?
Did my brother Frank find out?
Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.
Oh, what you doing now?
Where you going to live, then?
Where's that?
Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed.
Where would I find him?
Thorpey. They were waiting for us in the car park.
I won't be using the room tonight.
I'm staying with a friend.
Will this do?
They bloody hurt me.
What you going to do?
You're a bastard.
Oh, I'm straight.  Respectable.
Eh? Have a drink.
If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better.
Not going, Jack?
All right. Two hundred.
Four hundred?
You're not seeing me?
You have to cheer up, George, you aren't out yet.
You missed a fucking sale.  Big deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal. How you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.
He's doing very well.
Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
You build it!
You fucking build it!  Men come...
Should do something to them.
Yes.  I mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just...
As a "robbery"?!  No.
He'd give me a job.
Yes.  It is, George.  Yes.  It's a big decision.  And it's a big reward.  It's a big reward.  For one night's work.  But it's got to be tonight.
Dave.
Oh, yes, George.
They're going to come to everyone.
That's ridiculous.
In the abstract...
I, you know, they should be insured.
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board.  You.  You see how...I...  I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any...
Yes.
Yes.  They are old.
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
They stole...
What.  What kind of outfit are we running where...where anyone...
Were the leads...
The cops?
They aren't?
Why don't you think so?
Where were you?
Yes.
Yes.
Thieves.
Read it.  Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.  What happened here?
I, um, and may...maybe they're in... they're in...you should, John, if we're ins...
I don't know, George, why?
I don't want to go to lunch.
Excuse me, fella.
Shelly...
What about the other two?
Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
John.  John...
Why?
Then put me on the board.
Alright.
No.
You want to do business that way...? Alright.  Alright.  Alright. Alright.  What is there on the other list...?
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
Mmm.
What are you trying to tell me?
Why I don't...
How do you know I made it up?
You said, "You don't make something up unless it's sure to help."  How did you know that I made it up?
He told me my share was twenty-five.
Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.
Wait...uh, look...  Look, twelve, twenty, two, twen... twenty-five hundred, it's...take it.  Take it all...  Take it!
I...what?  Are you, are you, that's why...?  Are you nuts?  I'm...I'm going to close for you, I'm going to...  Here, here, I'm going to make this office...I'm going to be back there Number One...Hey, hey, hey!  This is only the beginning...List...list... listen. Listen.  Just one moment. List...here's what...here's what we're going to do.  Twenty percent. I'm going to give you twenty percent of my sales...  Twenty percent.  For as long as I am with the firm.  Fifty percent.  You're going to be my partner.  Fifty percent.  Of all my sales.
Their check's no good?  They're nuts...?
Don't.
John: John:...my daughter...
Just now.
Fuck you, Dave...
Fuck you care...?
How was it...?
The only arrangement I'll accept is full investment.  Period.  The whole eight units.  I know that you're saying 'be safe,' I know what you're saying.  I know if I left you to yourselves, you'd say 'come back tomorrow,' and when I walked out that door, you'd make a cup of coffee...you'd sit down...and you'd think 'let's be safe...' and not to disappoint me you'd go one unit or maybe two, because you'd become scared because you'd met possibility.  But this won't do, and that's not the subject..." Listen to this, I actually said this. "That's not the subject of our evening together." Now I handed them the pen.  I held it in my hand. I turned the contract, eight units eighty-two grand. "Now I want you to sign."  I sat there.  Five minutes.  Then, I sat there, Ricky, twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  Not a word, not a motion. What am I thinking? "My arm's getting tired?" No.  I did it.  I did it.  Like in the old says, Ricky.  Like I was taught... Like, like, like I used to do...I did it.
...yes...
And, and, and, I did it.  And I put a kid through school. She...and...Cold calling, fella. Door to door.  But you don't know. You don't know.  You never heard of a streak.  You never heard of "marshaling your sales force..." What are you, you're a secretary, John.  Fuck you.  That's my message for you.  Fuck you and kiss my ass. You don't like it, I'll go talk to Jerry Graff.  Period.  Fuck you. Put me on the board.  And I want three worthwhile leads today and I don't want any bullshit about them and I want 'em close together 'cause I'm going to hit them all today.  That's all I have to say to you.
Oh, Christ.
I own the property, my mother owns the property, I put her into it. I'm going to show you on the plats. You look when you get home A-3 through A-14 and 26 through 30. You take your time and if you still feel.
My wife told me to look into...
Mr. Morton's with American Express... he's...  I can tell Jim what you do...?
"Home Cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,
Home...
Rick...?
Ricky, I...
Yes.
I've got to talk to you...
Three business days.  They mean three business days.
I don't understand.
When did you write the check?
What's going on here?
She wants her money back.
I'm...
...what, what, say it.  Say it to me...
Fuckin' asshole.
You hear what I said?
Eight units.  Mountain View.
Bring that shit up.  Of my volume. You were on a bad one and I brought it up to you you'd harbor it.  You'd harbor it a long long while. And you'd be right.
I don't "want" it, if you catch my drift.
Yes.
We had a slight burglary last night.
...Mr. Williamson...
Did you like your party?
Did you see my present for you?
Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to the present time, you were an employee of the &quot;Genco Olive Oil Company.&quot;
What position did you occupy?
Constanzia.  We expected you last week; we sent the car to pick you up at the airport last week.
Don Francesco.  You murdered my husband, because he would not bend. And his oldest son Paolo, because he swore revenge.  But Vitone is only nine, and dumb-witted.  He never speaks.
He is weak.
I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.
I never met them.
No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
Jeeze, it's great you came along, Mike... You know, we've never spent a night out on the town together. I always thought you looked down on me for liking a good time.
No.  I mean, are you sure?
Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I can handle things.  I'm not dumb Christ, not like everyone says. I'm smart; and I want respect.
The 'patrone' is here.
That's off now.
He's not the same as when I met him.
He doesn't want my help any more. He doesn't need it.
She took a flight to San Francisco. We figure she's going to connect to New Hampshire; her parents' place.
There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom. I know that's upset you in the past; and you've felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.  But it is because I do trust you that I've kept so much secret from you.  It's precisely that at this moment, you are the only one that I can completely trust.  In time, you'll understand everything.
I've prepared this; have had it for over a month.  It won't explain everything; but indicates where I will be, so in a sense, it is my life.  Also, there are three tasks that must be executed immediately.  Pop would have given those to Luca -- You knew Pop as well as anyone, act as though you were him.  It discusses Kay as well; that will be the most difficult.  The men who tried to kill me tonight, will never leave the estate.
Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?
Go on, tell me.
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
You're right.
Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels.
A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.
Sir, the gentleman does not understand English.  He would not in any case, take the stand.  He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.
I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?
Kay.
How's the baby?
His brother came to help him.
Kay, I told you...
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
How can I let you leave; how can I let you take my children away? Don't you know me?  You understand, it's an impossibility.  I would never let it happen; no, never, not if it took all my strength, all my cunning.  But in time, soon, you'll feel differently.  You see, you'll be happy that I stopped you.  I know you.  You'll forget about this; you'll forget about the baby we lost... and we'll go on, you and I.
I represent the interests of the Corleone family.  We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.
You said you were Klingman.
Alright.  They bother me once in awhile.  Tell me, when Pop had troubles... did he ever think, even to himself, that he had gone the wrong way; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family, that he could... that he could... lose it instead?
I like sporting events -- I really enjoy watching them in the afternoon. One of the things I love about this country.  I loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series of 1919...I heard you had some trouble.
Enjoy.
Then you have to trace it.  Michael, people here look at me as a reliable man.  I can't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man.  But you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me.  You shouldn't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner.
This doubles my investment.
Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri; my brother's upstairs.  You wanta take a rest before you see him, or can I get you something, anything at all?
I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague.  Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights.  We have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in this country.  Are you?
Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?
Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.
Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.
Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family.
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
Trust me; do as I ask.
Your family all seem to be okay in the other houses; your Mother's still sleeping.
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
I'm talking about Italians!
Here is the six month's increase in advance.  You needn't speak to her about it, she's a proud woman.  See me again in another six months. But of course, you'll let her keep her dog.
What makes you say that?
These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny.
I wasn't going to try anything.
This old guy -- he's the kind of person I expected to meet when I moved out here.  Someone who's done things with his life.
You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again --
So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.
No.  You are a guest now.  You go in the living room.
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
Yeah?  What's your husband do?
Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
Good morning.
And your name is --?
Getting to be a warm day.  A scorcher, as you Yanks call it.
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
I'm sorry.  It's too white, too distracting.  Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
Would you be more comfortable barefoot?  Feel free to remove your boots and socks.
There's something about the openness of your face that makes me want to speak the truth.  Yes, my family ate dripping.  Beef dripping and four to a bed, and a privy out back in the alley.  Are you also from the slums, Mr. Boone?
Is this David's doing?
Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?
Just a trim.  And mine while you're at it.  Fingers are a bit stiff today.
Oh dear.  I <u>have</u> made you nervous.
I don't mean to be a prick, but that's how I feel.
Tell me more about yourself, Mr. Boone.  You have a steady companion?
Very well put.
I think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world.  Yes. I wish I had done more work.
But I chose freedom.  David was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue.  I didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely "the friend."  The dirty little secret of a nervous producer.
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.
You will not set me on another walk down memory lane.  Not this lane. Not today.
Just go.  Please.  Why don't you go?
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
Tell me something, Clayton.  Do you believe in mercy killing?
Storm's getting worse.
Barnett.  Barnett on the wire.
No.  It won't do.
You are much too human.
Just take off the fucking mask!
Look, if you want to die do it yourself!
Need some help?
I'm up.  Thanks.
Calm down, Clay.  Just calm down. We'll watch it.
Go home, Clay.  We're closing up.
By the way, I like the Renoir.
The central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations.  Whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short-circuited this mechanism. Parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random.
My God.  Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair?  I thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.
I would've thought Mr. Leslie Howard would be more your line.
Mr. Kay, sir.
Who was that at the door?
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.
So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?
Yes?
I have a proposal, Mr. Kay.  This mode of questioning is getting old, don't you think?
Can we talk about the horror movies now?
My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
I was going to take a swim.
Mr....Kay?
It's been a long time, Memphis --
Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley...
Who was the job for?
Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after himself ...
Well, well. You've caused quite a ruckus ...
I remember us having made some kind of deal, Randall. I don't remember this deal having some kind of time-limit. I look at you - here - in my town - and I'm confused...
I hope it's not your dear sweet mother...
Or your baby brother. What was his name?
I want you gone, Randall. Settle your affairs. Make it right with those you love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I want you out of here. Out of here for good this time ...
I'll catch you later, Randall --
What's this -- ?
When'd you get to town, Raines?
Diane 1.
Most of 'em are late-model...
Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?
The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --
How are we supposed to--
He doesn't return my calls. or my letters ...
D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?
Okay, then ... I just go to the Marriott and I'm set ...
Whatcha got left ... ?
We'll take it...
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
It looks just like a regular Mustang --
Hey, Kip ...
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
So what are you gonna do?
"Over--"  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
You?
Shadow games ...
After a while, it became a little pathetic ... Figured I'd put you out of your misery ...
Dad'd be proud --
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?
Having fun, Kip?
Come here -
You want me to buy her?
Call 911 -
You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's?
They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
She's trouble --
I go with you --
That's what I want ...
You mentioned that in your letters
C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?
Stop. What about Maserati Boy?
I do ... I cut "em...
You're still quite the boost, Randall Raines ...  Except now I've been chopped, and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife ...
You okay -- ?
What are you doing... ?
You think it can be done?
Hey, Memphis. Remember me? Toby Walker. I live next door ...
She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ...
What do you want, shithead?
Which way's out, man -- ?
What? What happened?
No. No. The guy from downtown.
I warned you a million times.
Take it easy.  We can talk about it.
What're you doing? What about the car?
I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband --
It's all bullshit. I swear. It's nothing. Whatever you want, we'll do.
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?
Batts's made. His whole crew is going to be looking for him. This is fucking bad.
Did he say what they're asking him about?
He didn't call?
Driving you crazy?  Don't get me started.  You're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all. What kind of people are these?
Well you know how he loves animals right? Anyway, last week he's drivin' home... 
--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.
I don't know what the fuck you're doin'. You're givin' us a ride.
Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal pussy.  So, when are you done with those meetin's?
Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.
Okay.
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
WILL!
Morgan, Let's go.
You got fired from pushing a broom, you little bitch.
Did your Uncle get arrested?
Oh my God, I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin' to tell you.
I don't think I...Larry?
How'd you like that course?
So why do you think I should work for the National Security Agency?
Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office?
I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
What's your name?  Don't you walk away from me. This is people's work, you can't graffiti here.
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
If I agree to this, I walk right now?
This rectangle is subdivided into rectangles. One edge of an inner rectangle is an integer. Can you prove that one edge of the larger rectangle is an integer?
--Maybe I don't want to spend my life sittin' around and explaining shit to people.
I can come back.
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
Thank you.
I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.
Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
Not Rick? You didn't send him to Rick?
I got it.
He married his cousin.
--No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--
--And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake--
Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been--
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
So I hear you're taking some time.
Where're you going?
I got one of those too.
How about one now?
About thirty million to one.
Did you buy all these books retail, or do you send away for like a "shrink kit" that comes with all these volumes included?
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?
You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books.
Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth.
Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
Crayons?
What does?
I teach this shit, I didn't say I knew how to do it.
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
When did you know she was the one?
So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away?
But you can't give back to them, Will.
I been there. I played my hand.
You want to read it?
I know.
I know.
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
I want to meet them.
I thought you said you'd show me your place.
C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages.
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me ask you a question? Do you have a photographic memory?
Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head.
Not a lick. I look at a piano and I see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. They saw a piano and they could play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano--
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
Is that what you think--
Yes, I do, Will.
You doin' the hirin'?
All right, mister. I'll go. You just show your license to contrack, an' then you make out a order--where an' when an' how much you gonna pay--an' you sign it an' we'll go.
'F we're workin' for you, it's our business too. An' how do we know--  --you ain't one a the guys that sent these things out?
Will ya look at her!
Twenty days work, oh boy!
Well, you said anybody can waltz... How'm *I* doin'?
What a place! How'd you like to walk acrost her?
She's hotter'n a heifer.
I didn't see nothin'.
That's not your affair. Name.
Can all of you work?
That's the way it is.
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
That cut you got?
Say, ain't you young Tom Joad--ol' Tom's boy?
No, I never. What?
Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!
They're all gone--or dead.
He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?
You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
Sure do.
I didn't mean nothing.
An' the nex' thing you know you'll be out, because they got it all figgered down to a T--until the harvest is in you're a *migrant* worker--afterwards, just a bum.
What's he fixin' to do, ma?
Now listen, Grampa. Listen to me, just a minute.
Easy, *easy!* You wanta bust his head wide open? Pull his arms, John.
*Ain't* a-goin'... ain't a-goin'...
Where you think you're going?
But will it--hurt the baby?
How 'bout it?
Muley tol' me what happened, Ma. Are we goin' to California true?
No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
Ma, you sick?
Ma, they comes a time when a man gets mad.
I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too.
Sure. Good-by.
This ain't a groc'ry store. We got bread to make san'widges with.
What was the use. He was right. There wasn't a thing in the world I could do about it.
She's jus' wore out, that's all.
Just in case. Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it.
Can you pick peaches?
You sure you got ever'thing ready?
Marty, you haven't changed a bit!
Bob. Bob Destephano.
Bob...
Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.
Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
I just play my own collection.
How long has it been?
Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.
Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
That's part of it.
It's always the little things.
Watched television?
Hello...?
Flowers. That's funny.
It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?
I was leaving.
I been looking at you, and I've decided that I want to share something with you.
Thank you, no.
I told them to kill you and they didn't.
Hey, Ken. How have you been?
I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.
Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury.
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
Did you see Blank in there?
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
I'll call them and tell them you're taking your time. Being a professional.
They told me you're taking lithium, mom.
Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
It didn't work out.
Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...
When I work with a horse, it's no good just me doing it. It doesn't work that way. The owner needs to be involved too.
You okay?
So how was your first and last day of branding?
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.
I thought you lived in Chicago?
Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Yeah.
Why didn't it work out?
Everything under control?
Just make yourself comfortable.
Oh, God, what are we going to do? I'm supposed to --
Oh, honey... What happened?
You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.
Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you?
I don't believe this!
Did he mention it?
I thought there were too many forks on the table.
Does anybody out there want something to drink?
Nothing.
Grace, I don't hate your father.
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
Started what?
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
So, what, uh, what train are you taking?
That bag's almost empty.
I should go get some of her things.
You've got to stop doing that?
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
Yeah. She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move. But, whenever it's just the two of us, I don't know... Anyway... what's happening with the Delco lawsuit?
So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
Oh well... branding will do that to you.
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
You were right about coming here. I'm sorry for not thinking...
Yeah, what?
It's so cruel.
What choice!!?
How's Peterson's holding up for you?
Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's...  Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...
Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing.
Good luck to you, Annie.
Mixed salad.
Yeah?
Mmm. An editor.
Isn't it like, obvious?
Have you heard from Judith's parents?
Do you want something else, honey? We order something else?
Honey, you all right? Did something fall?
Shouldn't we have invited Tom over?
You shut up, stupid!
Hi. It's a pleasure. I'm very grateful for the way you took in my girls here. I bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere.
Does a horse miss a saddle?
Listen to this bullshit.  "This is our world now. The world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is my manifesto." Huh, right, manifesto? "You may stop me, but you can't stop us all."
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
That's it! An electronic army! If I were us, I'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.
Very impressive.
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how many but... my head hurts.
Cereal, man, you owe me a pack.
I want it to have my children!
Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.
They'll trace you like that  man, cops are gonna find you, they're gonna find you with a smoking gun.
Oh, shit! He got me.
That's a nice score for a girl.
He's not in this class.
What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help.
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
Why did he come to you?
You look good in a dress.
Uhhh.. ahahaha...
So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby, eh? Academic? Purely sexual?
Yo, what's up?
Hello?
Purpose of visit?
You're late.
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
So?
Are you two okay?
No, no, we have to get out of here right now.
Is there another key?
I've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site.
What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.
How do we look?
Found it.
Why not?
I do.
Not like 'ol Ben Meeker do something like that.
What the hell did this?
Jamie, what happened?
Rachel, can I go get my costume on?
I'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay Jamie?
Rachel!
Why don't you go make some coffee.
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
Hell of a night.
Logan, I want you to stay here in case the family gets back.
Why?
Its true, Sheriff.
When he makes that call.
What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
How's it powered?
It's over.
Loomis. Haddonfield.
Hi, Annie, Laurie...
Well, are we still on for tonight?
You still spooked?
I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up.
Yes, you can.
Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
I don't want to.
You idiot!
Yeah, sure.
Come on... A skunk could have killed it...
Jesus!
You have the wrong feeling.
TOTALLY!
Lonnie Elam said never to go up there. Lonnie Elam said that's a haunted house. He said real awful stuff happened there once.
..."how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..."
Laurie...
Promise?
Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey.
Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. How could he get there? He can't drive.
...then he gets another physical by the state, and he makes his appearance before the judge. That should take four hours if we're lucky, then we're on our way.
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
I couldn't if I tried.
Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil.
Oh, yeah.
Oh!
What?
But I'm seeing him.
We got that idea on that trip to Paris.
Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The design's deliberately noncontextural.  But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions.
Now I ca-can't remember.
Have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus?
You know, there's no reason for panic.  I just want to rule out some things.
How ya doin', man?
What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.  What's the matter with you?
Hi, Dusty.
Yes, but you name names.
We--
Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee.
Uh, yes!
Fine.  Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met.  It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick.  I mean...you learn so much.  Do you like Caravaggio?
e.e. cummings.  I'd like to get you this.
Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera.  An architect.
Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
This is not an easy situation.
Lee...
Great idea.
God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?
Where're you going?
I want one with you.
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
I didn't say that.
I'm not accusing.  I'm asking.  Do you...do you find me too...too giving?  Too-too-too competent?  Too-too, I don't know, disgustingly perfect or something?
I don't know about that.  Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky.  W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy  but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...
Want some coffee or tea?
Hmm?
Elliot lusts after you.
What are you going to use for money?!
Oh, yes, you have!
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
Oh, Jesus!
You don't have a brain tumor.  He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY  No, naturally  they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em.
I don't know.  Cancer, I--
You're just realizing this now?
Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs?
Oh, yeah?
So how are you?
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
I'm okay.
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
What's the matter?  What's the matter with you?  You look pale.  You okay?
Glad you could put in an appearance.
Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
Oh!
Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.
Ohh!
Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!
Hannah and I...can't have any children.  Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it--  It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--
Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!
You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all.
I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it.
Not so!  No.  I think I've been very supportive.  I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice.
Oh, so loosely.
Well--
Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems.
Can we, can we go?
Oh, that's putting it mildly.  We did everything but exchange gunshots.
People change...you know.
No, the reason I ask is--
You're okay, though, huh?
Well, what about me?
Oh, it just came to me one day.
Oh, wow!
That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
You've gone off to America, on your <u>Vacation</u>...
To <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  What one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
<u>Who</u> are these guys...?
Who would that be.
Evelda Drumgo.
You're ready now.
...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... 
Brigham.  Go.  Affirmative.  Okay, Happiness is a Green Light.  We've got Evelda in the kitchen, cooking.  The dope's D.E.A.  <u>We</u> want her on Interstate Transportation of some firecrackers.  Starling:  you've got Drumgo, you know her from before.
...he was <u>wealthy</u>...
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
What else did I miss...?
...are they hard to get?
Why did he come back?
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
He escaped...
Agent Starling, would you come with me...?
Now, why in the world would he do that?
...and then, he'll be coming down.
..suitcase...locker...
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
A fellow with five fingers.
My husband brought it to me from America.
You know it?
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
...you told me you were studying for your examination by the <u>Studiolo</u>...
If your duty requires it.
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?-- 
Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard?  Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
My scar is a war-wound.
You know America?
Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
You find something objectionable to working in partnership with....
You look lovely.
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
Thank you, Cordell.
...which of us is free...?
...might I make a suggestion...?
...when I... 
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
...what?
...the purpose of the exercise... is it because they are <u>expensive</u>...
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
I don't understand.
I am on the track of...
I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
Speaking of the Vacant Post.
She must be something special After Dark.
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
Yes.
You think you're so...but you're just...
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
I'll bet you're glad I waited until the last day to have this conversation.
No.
Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
I'm in the picture on Wendy's wall. Niagara Falls. Family trip. Little Wendy foreground. Me background. What are the odds on that one?
Eavesdropping, eh?  Hear anything good?
There you are!  Man, I don't know how to thank...
Mine!
No, they're not from Wendy.
Am-ber!  Uh...don't do that.
What are you doing?
One day they'll find a cure for AIDS. They'll never find one for sex. It's kind of funny, most movies and stories with a bunch of camp counselors has some serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw who systematically butchers everybody one by one.
...and it hurts too much to keep these feelings inside me any longer...
We had fun. I even got along with Talia-- for about three minutes. I don't know why she hates me so much...
Something more interesting than that...How could you?  How could--!
Two billion years of evolution and                          ] you're what we've come up with--                            ] "Wichita"--the hot, cool, tell-it-                          ] like-it-is counselor with a dark                            ] side.                                                       ]
I'm really sorry I couldn't make it to your birthday party last month.
How's my little cheerleader? Now I know everyone at your high school isn't so uptight, come <u>on</u>.
I have a little prepared speech I give when my suitor wants more than I'd like to give him.... Gee Blank, I had a nice....
Take a break Veronica, sit down.
All right.
Is this turnout weak or what? I had <u>at least</u> seventy more people at my funeral.
No way, no day!
Veronica. What are you doing tonight?
It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
Good plan.
Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.
What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.
I'm just a little freaked, all right?  You got what you wanted, you know.
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
Mute!
Heather Chandler is more popular than ever now.
Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.
What is this shit?
I don't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we'll just be shooting them with blanks.
First tell me this similarity is not incredible.
Let's just...settle down. Ms. Fleming has given us a chance to atone for...
We're breaking up. I am out!
If you'll excuse me......
You really fucked me up, Veronica.
Dear Veronica, Heather was your soulmate.....Share.
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.
waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA looks at her with concern.
is chopping firewood in the back garden. HONORA approaches him.
I'd better be getting back. Bye, love.
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
Can I go now?
Who cares!
What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
And so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to accept Charles's proposal of marriage!
I'm so happy to see you!
That's coming along well!
Oh-what a nice outfit!
Mummy!
To be known as He!
He flings open the door and launches himself at the bed, ravishing her!
I shall call him Diello.
That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
Allison? Why can't remember what happened to my wife? Is it something I'm on that's... that's making me forget?
No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...
It's inside a moving car.
I've got numbers to back me up. Over the course of one year more Americans die in car accidents than did during the entire span of World War II.
Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?
The boss won't notice me doing a bad job because I'm not. Even if the boss thought I was slacking I'd know right away.
You win! Okay pull over.
But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.
Kirsty... Kirsty?
Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff left.
Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
Poor Trevor.
But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...
My teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. So that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity.
It was an analogy. Your soul is locked up inside you. You need to free it Trevor. You've blocked it from the healing process. That's what we need to do now. Heal your soul. And to do that I you have to give in utterly and without any hesitation or doubt. Do you know what I mean by giving in? It's about trust. Do you trust me implicitly?
Are you ready?
-Tawny.
Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.
You should give it to someone with only one leg.
Sell it to him.  You get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride.  I got a job, nice apartment.  I do okay.
That's close enough.  It's a confession.  The truth.  Jesus, I'm sorry, LaPlante.  I had the shoe, you said you didn't want, publicity because of your legal problems.
What have I done?  I was dirt poor and useless... but I was honest.
You stole her purse!  While you were saving her?
You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me.
Listen, John, you better double my attorney's fee.  She's very inexperienced, but she done a great job for me. And give her your autograph.  She thinks you're some kinda holy man.
Often, uh.
She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
Uh, I know you're having financial difficulties, Mister LaPlante, but I wonder if... I mean, the money I loaned you...
Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...
That fake <u>inspired</u> you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job <u>twenty-five hundred</u> goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna <u>do</u> <u>time</u>!  You're s'posed to be an <u>attorney</u> for Chrissake!  You're s'posed to have <u>good judgment</u>!
Bill, I got some legal problems and I...
I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.
Three weeks, Ev.  I didn't tell him I killed anybody...
The homeless!
For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way.  Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort is gonna pick us up en route.  You too, LaPlante.
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
Listen, buddy, I'm really enjoying this relationship we got going here. I been missing out on not knowing you better.  Thing is, I got all this business stuff...
I... I know that, John...
I know the truth, John.  I'm flying in some guys from your unit in Vietnam tomorrow.  Interviewing them live on network hookup!
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
What is it?
It would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical, hardbitten newswoman.  Besides it wouldn't be a bad story, would it, "Newswoman Saves Suicide?"
He's right.  It's unprofessional.
Ticket!  What's going on?
Upset!  What's he upset about?
Hi, Chief.  You like the suicide?
LaPlante!  That asshole!  I don't... Hey, is that you, from the tee vee? In person?
No dead body.  Too bad.  Not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. Exclusive!
I didn't ask him.
Excuse me, Ms. Gayley.  That guy Inspector Dayton... he's recovered a bunch of your credit cards and he wants...
Look at that.  You can't buy better protection than that.  That there is your Man's Best Friend.
Any particular brand?
And what about work?  Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now?
I'm happy that you're working again.  As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?
And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that?
Things are beginning to come to a head.  I can feel it.  And I want everything to be perfect.
Oh no -- I mean, she's genuinely made me more fulfilled in many ways -- and I hope eventually to be able to teach her a few things, too.  What I mean is, I guess I'm still waiting for just that right -- synthesis between us -- where everything will be understood between us without even the need for words.
Well, can I make an appointment?
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
You must value your independence.
I was driving by -- I saw all the cars.  Are you all right?
About what?
Your daddy and I are kind of mad at each other right now, so we have to spend some time apart.
Well, that's what happens with grownups, too.
Daddy's gone where Rudolf went and isn't coming back!
Mommy!
He doesn't have a temperature.
Whew.
How was lunch?
How was your lunch with Charlie?
I <u>remember</u> what day you wore that jacket.  It was <u>Monday</u>.  The day you were all day in <u>meetings</u> again?  And had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>?
He wants to see me!
Boy, you really buckle under a little pressure, don't you?
Should I come home when I'm finished there?
God, your sister's really hot.
Let's follow 'em.
We'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then?
Is it a king or a queen?
You'll have no need for that, Highlander.
Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
You cannot run from your destiny, Conner.
The river.
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
Thank you, Thomas.
As friends -- always as friends.
You're looking a wee bit green, Thomas.
Well?
What do you think?
Electro magnetic soundings indicate we've only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber.
You guys are from the British museum, right?
I was wondering if I could talk to you?
Corpses?
Why do you stare at me like that?
You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
Good evening.
You didn't answer my question.
On the back it has--
Be careful, Conner.
What now?
He's fine.  He swears he never left his post for a moment.  He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside.
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
Would you care for some water, Conner?
Don't leave us, Conner.
You kept it?
Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
Would you like to deposit this in your account?
The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith.  They've got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer and Thomas.
Wow.  Sure, right away, Chief.
Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?
And by doing so, he would've known we have spies in his organization.
You should warn them, Sonny.
<u>Get on the floor</u>!
C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot!
Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. We won't be able to hide.
Then we might as well die rich.
Talley?
You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?
You picked a bad house to hole up in, son.
Give up.
My father needs a doctor.  <u>Please</u>.
Talley lives here.  I don't know if the place has security or not.
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
No one's coming.
I'm not gonna leave you!
Want one?
What do you want?
What happened?
Is something wrong with Jane?
It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
One at a time!  Clear the air!  Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?
I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant.
He says he has gasoline set to burn the place.
I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
It's right in front of us.
I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!
Okay.
What do you want me to do?
I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
We're almost home, you and me.  Keep your shit together.  This isn't L.A.
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
What happened?
Paul!
No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.
You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president.
Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here.
Hold the line here. Do not shoot! The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. Paul approaches Oliver
Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all.
I don't understand.
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.
The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders ‘we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us.’ What do you think would have happened? No different.
You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
I will try my best George but these days I have no time for rallies or politics.
What do you mean George?
There are no more rooms.
Mr. Manager.
I need you to go to this address and bring my brother-in-law and his family.
Was there blood?
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
This time the Militia will kill us.
No.
Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.
Listen to me woman. I said all the whites are leaving. The French, the Italians, even the Belgian UN soldiers.
A car.
Ask them to wait a little longer. For the twins.
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
You have taken business class?
Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself.
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
It's not, baby. Just a matter of minutes now, before somebody pulls the trigger --
Looks like we're it.
Oh, for chrissake --
Something just must've...frightened her, that's all.
Now what do we do? We've got to hold him somewhere 'til the police --
You're not my list.
What?
I'm sorry --
You said that was an accident.
What is it? What's in there?
Pritchett, is that you?
This is nuts.
-- the stained glass --
I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --
Good point.
This is the best we're gonna do.
Don't think it's even an issue.
No. It's just trying to frighten us.
Where did it go?
What?
Don't touch me!
What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
Jesus!
I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.
You think this is fucking funny??
Ever seen one that starts at the top? 20 stories worth of top?
-- even if I give you a million as well?
Yeah. Why's there five checks? There's only four of us.
Sorry.
I...don't think...anybody should be touching the body.
If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now.
Don't test me, I'm real prepared to use this to stay alive --
-- listen to me, goddamnit --
But the million bucks each, that's for real?
Won't do any good.
There is something very not normal going on here!
Excuse me?
-- hey! --
-- Eddie!!
I feel something.  It's faint, but...it's there...
We don't have proof of that.
I have to admit you really have a beautiful home.
I have to admit I was skeptical.  Until now.
It will heal.
By freeing them.
Don't play games with me, little girl.
Well then who did?!
Where are we going to go, mommy?
She says she's lonely...
Mommy please help me!
I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.
Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.
I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.
What will Aubrey think?
Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
What are you talking about?
A friend?
Aubrey!
I'm fine.
Where is your daughter?  She might be able to give us some information.
Maura.
Thank you.  I believe she would have wanted it.
I hope everything works out for you, and you find happiness in your new home.
We'll never know for sure.
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
Do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at?
Where did you find this?
Right.  Like last night's doozie.
Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter.
The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.
Wha .... ?
I put some decaf on.  Er ... make yourself comfortable.
... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is.
This is great.  And it's yours?  You like own it?
Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
Cool.  I read a book once.  It was like all these people discovering who they used to be.  You know, like reincarnation?  It was really good.  You ever read that?
Sure.  Why?
Everything sold as is.  No guarantees. No returns.
You gonna buy?
But you gave me a rose ...
You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ...
Yes.
You're apologizing?
Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
Yeah right.  Look ...
That was beautiful.
The safe's a Simpson 71.  Last time I played the game, Simpson only had a 40.
Cameras?
They record everything their video surveillance takes in...
"And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo."
"You could be swinging on a star."
Boing.  Uh, this I don t understand...
Welcome to Rome, sir.
My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray, black turtleneck, Pocket Fisherman, acid, collapsible yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps. Gee Stud, this is going to be some date.  No Harvey's Bristol Cream?
"Messed around" messed around?  I know-- I don't want to know.  First base?  Second Base?  Stop me when I'm getting warm...
Whoa.  Name's Hawkins, Eddie Hawkins. My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't call me Hudson, not even as a joke. The Nuns at St. Agnes called me that and they're the ones who helped make me what I am today. Not a compliment...
Hudson, don't you understand...
Oh Hudson...
Da Vinci made the real directions in a secret script that I decoded. The way the machine is running now, the gold will produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down.  Isn't it wonderful?
I wanna know...
Have I ever told you the world is beautiful...  I'd really like to play Nintendo with you, or something...
Way to go, Anna.
Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of.  Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas...
Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.
Oh... Let's see.  There are organizations that think we wanted the "Sforza" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand.  We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved.  I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out....
Hudson Hawkins gets the chair of honor.  How about a Gates-arita?  I used real hot dogs.
Anybody have a cigarette?  But seriously, do me a favor and Concorde me back to prison.  I don't care anymore.  I hope you have the receipts for the threads.
Snappy.
The Hoopsucker!
My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!
Who are you? How did you know who I am?
I don't mean that! Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't never gonna make you happy! Never made Warin' happy.
Ol' satchel-butt...
Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future --
Cigarette?
...A Muncie girl! Talk about the cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy. I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud.
Is that all, Mr. Barnes?
Well, I --
Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
Smitty.
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.
Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.
Oh, Norville --
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
You don't know anything! Fact is they haven't bought it! The stock is cheap, Archer! What're they waiting for?
Just got hired today!
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
...It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!
I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
-- Uh... Buzz, I'm sorry, I -- Buzz, you gotta forgive me! I shouldn't a fired you, I didn't know what I was doing! I was a little funny in the head, I --
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
...Who let you in?
My God! The Bumstead contracts!!
You nitwit! I worked for three years on this deal!
I got gas, Bennie.
She finds him.
But I'm Miss Jessica's nurse, Alma. You don't have to do that for me.
-- and when my husband died I felt helpless. They disobeyed me -- things went from bad to worse. All my husband's dreams of good health, good sanitation, good morals for these sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him.  Then, almost accidentally, I discovered the secret of how to deal with them. There was a girl with a baby -- again and again I begged her to boil the drinking water. She never would. Then I told her the god, Shango, would be pleased and kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it. She boiled the water from then on.
They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.
As a matter of fact, it means the sugar syrup is ready to be poured off.  You'll have to excuse me.
But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?
But don't you have to work?
Listen, did I tell you that story about the little mule at the plantation -- the little mule and Clement?  Let me tell you.  It's one of the funniest stories --
I wish I hadn't heard --
I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?
You know what she is!  That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!
It is not beautiful.
Have the servants made you comfortable?
Why was the maid crying?
You think I love Jessica and want her back. It is like you to think that -- clean, decent thinking.
Wesley!
All that you say comes down to the same thing.  You are asking me to pass a sentence of life or death on my own wife.
I don't know -- I don't know--
Right o'.
Then again, why should she be? I mean with us, with our...
Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.
The Halfords have invited us again this year.
You crying?
Don't be dim.
Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.
Elena, it's not what you think. It's not a big plot. Honestly. Honestly. I don't know if you want to go over this now, but it's just something that comes over me. I don't feel good about it. I know I've done what I didn't want to do. I don't know --
So how's school treating you?
Classes?
About?
It's like farming. I am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks, and George Clair has obviously, in the mere two years since he joined the firm, he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro, and I assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course. And the guy talks - incessantly -- throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes - on topics that are the supposed domain of my department --
... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and --
What the hell are you kids doing down here?
Your toes cold?
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
-- Well what am I supposed to call you?
Actually it's not about work, it's advice about --
Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--
You okay?
Hi mom.
Who?
Mikey Williams?
I'm thinking of going back to school.
How'd you know?
Here you are.
Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year.
It's been a tremendously transformative year -- maybe a little controversial of course, but we're breaking down the old Unitarian barriers --
-- And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.
You're here... I'm a bit surprised.
Arise and shine, young Hood.
No more man. I'm about to drop as it is.
Awesome sleet and rain.
Um, Libbets. Hey, Dostoyevsky, I'm also really a fan, and what you were saying, you know, have you ever read The Idiot?
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.
Maybe you should have just a half.
My what?
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
No one.
It's freezing.
I have not touched your sh--  Stuff. You watching this?
Her name's Libbets.
And?
Mikey was looking for you.
They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.
Not really.
He would have liked that.
Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through.
What are you doing here?
Good.
What do you want to talk about?
You know my plan of action.
That's right.
Looks like the natives are restless.
You don't have to be involved, Will.
Fred Duggar?
One of your cases?
"She was nice."  Wow.  That makes me all soft inside.  Ever occur to you she didn't love you back?
Stuff.
How should I know?...
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
I told you that was an accident!
Couldn't get it up, Walter?
So you have the answers...
That is a picture, nothing more.
Claudia is dear to me. My... daughter.
You would never give up life. If the world were reduced to one empty cell, on fragile candle, you stay alive and study it. You see too clearly. You see too much.
Laudanum!
Don't Louis --
We're immortal. You've always known that.
Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?
You never talked to me like that - in all these years.
Or her, or her - or any of them?
This is monstrous!
You want death? Is it death you want?
You're not afraid of anything, are you?
What do you want from me?
You'll get used to killing. Just forget about that mortal coil. You'll become accustomed to things all too quickly.
There's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some...
What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell.
You fool, what have you done?
Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.
I didn't want to kill her.
Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie...
I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
And they frighten you?
You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. I've had a very unusual life.
It's just a room...
You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?
You can't look at them...
The story about stakes through the heart?
No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
You promise to care for her then?
Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it.
Sorry. Emergencies only.
Your what?
Storm season?
I don't know, man. Maybe we should keep going, find a phone --
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
I thought you were out of town!
I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
That could break the machine.
He's not coming. I thought he was just...
Yeah.
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.
What? What are you talking about? Where?
Come on. We're gonna be okay.
...Why?
Oh, look. Another day in paradise with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss Psychotic Episode.
Ahh, that feels great.
Well, I'm in school and --
Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
Don't really have the market for something like this...  I can go two...two-fifty.
Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period.
You stumbled into my hiding place.
Where is Miss Wollsten?
) You feel the symptoms?
Did you hear what Thea said -- as if she knew what threatens us.
You were singing, weren't you? A beautiful voice, Miss St. Aubyn.
Where's Thea?
There's no reason to decide any of us are going to die.
What are you doing?
Miss Wollsten shares the room with you?
The young man, Mr. Davis, seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer —— a correspondent of some sort ——
You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.
Your father loved me.  He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life ——you've ruined mine ——
This girl --
Do you mind if I go with you?
There is something evil about her.
Thea is so like her —— in every feature ——
Because she loved him.  I know him, Thea. Believe me, he is not a cruel man.
By letting me help you.
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow –– you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
Poor George . . . Sit down.
Who is it?
. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
Hey, Violet!  Hey, listen –– that's Violet Bick!
Oh –– Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
On V-J Day he wept and prayed again.
Old college graduate now, huh?
Goodbye, everybody!
Well then, how do you know?
Okay –– all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh?
Well, Nick, that's your name, isn't it?
Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school?
She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go.
Two cents worth of shoelaces?
Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.
Hey, George . . .
Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'?
Well, what do you know –– wife.
Why didn't you call me?
Yes, hello? George . . . it's Potter.
Now look, did you buy anything?
All right. All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
Pop!
Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.
With coconuts?
Do I look as funny as you do?
I'll take it. And then what?
Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by.
My mother just called you? Well, how did she know?
Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here.
Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.
You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.
Oh, George, George, George.
Oh, George, George!
Put those things in the car and I'll get your tie and studs together.
How about that one there?
For me...?
Oh, shit.
Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m.
Why not?
We got a helluva tide this month.
Of course not,  They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place.  He'll do it for me.
Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone.
I can't let you take her out.
Mike's out there.
See where Cable Junction is?  Look to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's it.
Where to?
What else is there to do?
Michael.
Sailing?  Forget it.  You're beached. Grounded.  No more boats.
I don't know what you did, but that kid stopped.  I haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days.  Believe me, it's a pleasure....
Wait a minute....
Look at that:
The whale's mouth?
Do you?
Do I have to talk to those two?
Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?
Let's get the kid home.
Eat Cheerios.
Hi.  I closed a sale today, without Len.  That's $1200 commission, if the papers go through.
What?
Stop that!  We're not going any place.  You love it here.  Tell me what the hell happened!
They have no right to treat you like that.  You've given them every- thing.  For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
What're you going to do today?
Hello, hello.  It went well, I thought.
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
Martin, it could be anything.
Yeah?  Then what?
Hang on!
You're not going out right away, are you?
No class.
That's what I want -- a gaff rig.
Anyone know what time it is?
Eddie, can we do that?  Can we go skiing?  We can use my Uncle's boat.  Eddie?
Anything.  Anything.
You do everything your parents tell you?
Do I have to play with the little kids?
Yeah.
Oh, my God....
Why don't you take a rest, Brian?
Go on, Doctor.
It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
Absolutely.  Good idea.
He's going with you, Doctor.
I'll need more men to look.
You see the three-quarter socket?
Aren't you suiting up, mate?
Never know down there.  Helps to have a friend, sometimes.
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.
Honey... you all right?
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
Where are you going?
You all right?
You're going down there again?
You amaze me.  I'm more scared than you.
Finally.
No, we'll go through here.
Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way.  You're not going to walk all the way around?
Put it under your pillow and sleep on it and the tooth fairy will --
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
Nobody told me.
I'm sorry.
That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.
You can get killed!
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
Why?
I insist you get rid of that bomb.
Some miss all their shots.
Philip.
I think that you and I are natural enemies.
Hello.  I think his nap's over.
Believe me, I am.
He's big as a bloody bus!
Musclehead?
Hi, Mike.
I was seeing this guy off.  He flew in from Dallas.  Wants to marry me.  He's okay, but Texans are so possessive.
'Course they're also so rich.
I'm a water-skier.
Ahhh, ahhh...
Yeah, well I didn't!
You set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen.
How far away is filter number four?
He's big, Hutton.  You never saw anything so big.  Watch yourself.
What kind of trouble?
We see him, Mike.  Between the stadium and the ski show island.
In a restaurant.  You sit there and they swim around you.
How is he?  Still fighting crime?
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
Thea....
I bought him his first legal drink. He got so pissed that night....
What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
The doctor said she should be all right...She's in shock....
Henny Youngman....
What the hell's it doing in warm water anyway...?
Get the bang sticks.  We're going down.
Ask the big doctor about his work.  Tough life you Bahamian beach bum... Playing in the water all day....
In a minute....
No, no...It's too dangerous....
I'll be in to read you a story.
It came for him.  It waited all this time and it came for him....
You're damn right I'm serious....
Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please....
It got him....
Depends on where you want to go....
How can you just take the plane like this?
I can't....
I'm fine.
I have two right feet.
I tried winter once.  Burlington, Vermont.  Flew a run to New York.  I have a bone in my foot that still hasn't thawed.  When I was a small boy....
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
There's nothing to be sorry about.
You sure you don't need glasses?
I tried to tell you...I tried....
You're going after her in that? You're crazy...It'll take all day in that bathtub....
Maybe the plane gave it indigestion....
What do you deliver on all those charters you...?
Can't this thing go any faster?
Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing?
And it's always worked?
What's so funny about that?
I'm coming...How close is it?
You getting a reading on them?
Your equipment has crapped out again....
I'll do it, Jake.
She's in management....
Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....
Where's Lenny?
What? Whatta you mean, no? Who is -- who is telling you? Whatta you mean, no? Yes, you'll wear pink or else. Or else you'll wear pink.  And, darlin', oh, I'm gonna take you to Coney Island.
As I said, Sergeant, you nearly ran into <u>me</u>? What's the problem?
What do you think?
Yeah, he can go ...
What time is it?
He thinks you stole his promotion.  What exactly you doin there, John?
It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..
Why don't you dump it? Mail it off. Give the fucking F.B.I. a present?
Had a seeing Eye Dog since she was eighteen .. didn't I tell you those dogs meant something ..
Why?
That isn't what you said before.
Why's she blind, Bro?
God, it pisses me off, Ross.
Ease off, John ..
Yeah .. I guess she's in the kit- chen .. We got a so-called prof- essional cook out there having a nervous breakdown over a turkey ..
Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
I never asked if he could "see." I just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything?
I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life ..
No.
Have you been here long?
You got a warrant for this?
You think John would like it?
How you doing on those shoes?
You want something, darling?
Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of luck I'm goin home. What we got?
You know.  I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
It's not "love me."  It's not "trust my handshake."  It's make the sale. Get it signed.  There shouldn't be "confusion" about that.
No one has ever dumped me.
Oh Jerry.
Let me think about that.  Want something to drink?
Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.
... this is... uh... too funny...
Oh tsht. Yes.
Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
And I guess we didn't talk about money.  So, I'll just dive in --
Dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back. We are so very very back.  I re-signed Cush. We're set.
It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Hey you.
Too bad.
I'm working with you because of that memo...
Good.  Good.  Glad is good.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
Wait. Where is he?
Matt, I came here because in all honesty your son is just another piece of cattle to SMI.  But to me --
Denver is where he should be.
I'm sorry, I --
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
You're loving me now, aren't ya?
I got there from "coin," dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan.
The kid is amazing.
Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife.
You don't want to go home, do you?
That's an answer.
Thanks for coming.
Gorgeous.
Marcee.  How's my favorite player's wife?
Marcee, things are changing around here.  You and Rod will have my total personal attention.
Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.
Gimme a second here... Tidwell... Arizona contract... new glass cabinet...
You...
One-two-three, swing.
Let's go the zoo.
You said "fuck".
Now go kiss your daddy, quick.
He should have kept his head tucked down.
Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!
We can't just...
Sorry.
How much weight have you lost?
Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
Eric! Are you here?
What?...WHAT!?
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
He could have died.
ALAN!
Good luck with the fund raising.
Eric, your parents are both here.
The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.
Know what this is?
You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?
Is there an antidote?
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
I didn't know you -- weren't well.
They do have motives.  Why did you want to see me?  Your message said it was urgent.
InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
Are you looking for a problem?
That was a pair bond!  A family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound!
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
Dad!
Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?
What kind of gun is that?
How close do you have to be?
The radio rig is inside.  It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem.
You version of it.
Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?
Their what?
You know how to work a radio, don't you?
No way.
Do you see any family resemblance here?
Then this is our chance.
I think she's with Sarah!
Something's wrong.
No.  I'm quite certain you can't.
You gentlemen feel you have to do this now?
You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!
You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
All right.  I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will too.  Do you have enough to publish?
Visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage.
The lysine contingency - it's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  Dr. Wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. Animals can't manufacture the amino acid lysine.  Unless they're continually supplied with lysine by us, they'll go into a coma and die.
How long will this take?
Yours was fully illustrated, honey.
Yes.  We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat them.
Did I say jerk?
You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.
Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell.
So what are you thinking?
Oh Ellie.  It's so beautiful.  It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
Do you see anything?
That's right.  Will break through.
God creates dinosaurs.  God destroys dinosaurs.  God creates man.  Man destroys God.  Man creates dinosaurs.
Uh - - thumb!  The same way.
Oh, imperfections?
Unpredictability....
Can we chance moving him?
What's this I hear at the airportŠ Hammond's not even here?
You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters  animatronics?
John, we - - what I'm just saying....
Have a heart gentlemen.  Their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion.
Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
'Course you could just wait in there while we go back and get help.
Come on, try some.  Take a bite.
Go, go, go, jump!
So you two dig up dinosaurs?
You got any kids?
I didn't say you were scared.
Where does he think he's going?
Hey, we were saving that!
Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
Well, it's - - right up your alley.  Look, why don't you both  come on down for the weekend.  Love to have the opinion of a paleobotoanist as well.  I've got a jet standing by at Choteau. 
Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.
Liar!  You said you wouldn't leave!
C'mon Tim, move down, damn it!
Do as he says!  The power's coming back, Timmy!
You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
Don't do that!
Your silence intrigues me.
But this is nature!  Why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!
I think perhaps I'll just sit down.  I don't suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?
I don't know, I don't know.  I'm sorry - -
No, no, sh, sh, sh - - stop!  Stop! Stop!  Don't let the monsters come over here!
I'm a hacker!
Hey Lex, ahhhchooo!  Hey Lex, com here.
That's not true...
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.
I can't wait to hear your opening argument.	"Ladies and Gentlemen	of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..."
It's still on.
What are the charges?
Ruby... this guy almost took out an entire Tactical Response Team. You can't expect me to just leave you --
So... why can't Jason get a fair trial?
No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy...  And I'm a bed-wetter.
How do we prove it?
Cute waitresses?
I think I'm onto something, Joe.
Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
You're not going to be there?
It's all right. I'm simply in shock... this is what happens to people when they experience events they can't understand or comprehend. The mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it's been exposed to.  I'm going to need a lot of therapy.
You saw him?
What are you doing?
How long will the effect last?
Are you all right?
Have you worked here long?
Just what you've published.
These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
I was restoring some stones here in the upper section one day -- and I found this.
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
You wanted to see me, sir.
I usually take lunch by the River.
No, sir.
Was there something else?
Well -- nice to know life exists outside the office.
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
-- I don't know the Musil district.
You think what we're doing is so wrong?  And what are you doing? Pursuing goodness?  For what?  To answer to some supreme tribunal?
I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity.
Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  People disappear up there regularly.   If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
-- I was just trying to finish some work!
What's the matter with you?
I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
And I suppose Dr. Murnau didn't die in a cave-in.  You killed him to free the Position of Orlac Medical Officer for your own ends.
May I ask where your two warders are?
"Raban" -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.
Oskar!
I understand he was wounded in the lung.
Then that's the place for us!
Hi - Carl Denham. I'm A big admirer of your work, sir. I've loved all your discoveries. I really want to work closely with you on this incredible find. It'll be good for you and good for me.
Now look at this fine example of early Hindu art ... I don't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...
Father!
Where do I charter a boat?
Jack!
Barricade the gates! Quick!
They're stoking the boilers. As soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here.
Hey! I thought these things were supposed to be extinct!
They were just tasting the berries.
Haven't seen her - not since we got back.
Do you always have to repeat?
Yes indeed.
A few more days. We know who did this.
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it.
If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
You remind me of my uncle.
Klute, tell me, what's your bag? Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? Or --
You've changed your mind? You do want to play?
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
He never told me.
What're you gonna do next?
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
What's the matter?
I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead.
How can you do it to yourself?
I'm still scared.  I mean different but still.  Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed?
Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good.
You and I -- a relationship.
Oh look what he did in them.
Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but -- don't you think we better be realistic?
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
We grew up together. Kids.
No.
That's a lot of people to die unknown.
He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything.
Think this is our guy?
Why couldn't you ever find out anything from the girl?
Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas about the case --
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
Mr. Kramer?
What do you have here, Billy?
Huh?...Oh God...What time is it?
I'll tell you what, kiddo--why don't I fix us some French toast?
What about my orange juice?
Uh, huh...
Sure.  Too much birthday cake, right?
It's just...I've been catching a lot of flack at the office...
I think I'm going to throw up.
Then eat around it.
Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
Not on your life.  That's it. I've had it with crap around this house.  From now on, no more pizza!  Get it?  Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being!
Daddy?
Billy.   This is Dr. Alvarez. She would like to talk to you.
See.  That's my name.
Was there Burger King?
Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father.  Now there is a man who is very wise.  He's called a judge.  And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with.
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
Objection!
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell the court how long you were married?
Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?
No further questions.  Thank you Mrs. Phillips.
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you were married seven years. Is that correct?
In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way.
A heavy drinker?
Look, it's not your fault, okay? It's me.  It's my fault--you just married the wrong person.
Where are you going?
Ted, when we got married it was because I was twenty-seven years old and I thought I should get married and...when I had Billy it was because I thought I should have a baby...and I guess all I did was mess up my life and your life and--
Jesus Christ.  That's a real blockbuster.  I always figured you guys had it made.
Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.
All right, Jim.  You said I was running this show, right? You said no decisions without my approval, right?  Well what the hell is this? What's going on, Jim?
Kramer, I've got to go.  I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.
So...what's so terrible about that?
No.  No, I don't believe it. Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen.  He gave me my shot in this business. If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be--I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...
Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.
Mr. O'Connor called.  There's a meeting with the Revlon people in the board room and you're fifteen minutes late.
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
I lost him?  I lost him?
All right, Thelma, you want to know what's going on?  I'll tell you what's going on.  I'll tell you exactly what's going on.
You're on your own, understand?
What d'you tell her?
He's okay...Thel, can I ask you a favor?
Thelma, if I die--
Ted.
Please go away, Thel...I...I just have to be by myself for a little while...
Not the way to talk to people.
I do, now.
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
Did you receive the letter?
Who am I?
I need to squeeze this brain.
Tell me.
I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child.
I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.
Me?
What do you think?
Things change, Kundun.
Am I running away?
This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
You can't take a cow by eminent domain.
Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  <u>No</u>.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile...
Why are we landing?
And what would he do come winter?
Could <u>she</u> stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse.
I do <u>not</u> like you.
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.
And again.  How would you get him on land?
Where is he?
Hector.  The big one has no sense of humor.  And since <u>he's</u> the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.
Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
I'm okay.
In Maine?
If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
You flew up here because your boss--
They respond pretty quick.  I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on.
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
Sorry.
What?
Calm down.
We might as well pack.
It can't work.
No.
You think?
I'm ready when you are.
Hank.  The little cannon you brought, get it.  Guard the shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.
Now I'm gonna puke.
If you get a safe shot...
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
This... how long did this attack go on for?
Not yet.
What?
What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.
Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious?
Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
Hank!
This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
Sorry?
I'm not even a field person.
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.
You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.
Myra.
What'd I do?
Boy, is that smart...
Lecter said a lot of things.
"Desperately random." What does he mean?
But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.
Agent Starling! Telephone!
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
What you're doing, Miss Starling, is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview, and refusing to share information with me. For the third time!
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. I want you to go after him again today, in the asylum.
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?
Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see.
Why?
Are you finished?
When I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it?  That was just smoke, Starling, I had to get rid of him. You did well in there.
You seem pretty sure of that.
State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
Sir, that's great news. But how -
And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?
I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.
Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.
She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer.
My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.
What is it?
I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive... after so long apart and after you've traveled so far...
Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see?
Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...
Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
How long?
I'll cover them from the top of the casement.
So the Huron are the servants of the French?  To do what the French are shamed to do?
Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
That judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with Webb to defend their farms & families... Major Heyward was at John Cameron's. He saw what it was.
I'll have none of that!  Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. Not a butcher.
Does Webb not even know we are besieged?
First rank! Second rank! Present arms! 
Right - about face! March! First rank present!
No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers... will receive many gifts.
Yes.
Yes.
What is enough?
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
My son has been sadly injured. Who did this?
Such as...?
My colors?
And?
Not exactly a big ocean country.
That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
Bullshit...I was just talking to him.  I saw him move.
No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted.  I thought DeJesus fixed that?
We don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and--
Where the hell've you been?
That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
You think I should hang around more with the crew?
We made it!
The internal monitors read normal.
Something wrong, Cobb?
No!
Oh, God, she's out there...
Give me a readout, DeJesus.
How do you feel, DeJesus?
...as long as you know it's not in your contract.
Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.
Forty-eight hours!
No way, Mister Beck!  <u>No</u> <u>fucking way</u>!  We just did a full shift, you can't call Shack duty on top of a full shift.  It's a contract violation!
So that's all you do?...
"Routine," my ass!  Ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!
Fuck semantics, Doc! You saying its like part DeJesus, part Sixpack, part Bowman?!
What is it?
How is he?
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
It saw us!
The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?
A what?
When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.
You fucking well have to get 'em!
Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .
I hate these Southern shites.
I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.
Son?
Jesus, I have heard about him.
Dog, I have found the cash!
Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.
Yeah, one of them's out.
My neck, Dog.  That's the last bag?
J, what's going on out there?  Get the rifle out, Charles. We're being fucked.
Right, his leg's going now.
Invitations.
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.
Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?
Well, what do you want us to do about it?
And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.
I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.
You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.
I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.
The only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car which is sitting outside?
You must be Eddy. JD's son.
And?
Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.
I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.
Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days.
And that does include the amp?
Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.
You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will move it for you.
This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
I don't know what the big deal is.
If you had your way I wouldn't have any friends.
Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
Please.
Because it's a job?
Sam the Man.
I hear they're closing that post down.
So?
Whole different story; isn't it?
Oh. Right. And you're in--?
No. You?
You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
Where'd he get all this?
Spanish in Florida called him Juan Caballo. John Horse.
Same as they done in Mexico.
I got a pretty good guess.
Dad--?
Dad, I talked to the track coach--
What?
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
Mikey--
Seriously.
Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth.
You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
There's not that much down here, Colonel. Big O's is the only place in the county that our African American soldiers are uhm--that they feel comfortable in.
I sprint the last quarter mile. You gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to.
This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.
There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection.
Is very beautiful, your car.
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
I thought you were married!
A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it.
Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned about crime--
You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?
He still living?
People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
I got an idea what happened.
Steve called for you.
Thank you.
Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails."
I've seen 'em.
And my father?
Pilar, is uhm--is Amado okay?
Could of been. That was white people's business.
She finally got in--
You got in late last night.
How come?
Morning, Sheriff.
Time marches on.
Three months.
Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since.
When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.
It isn't. Not by a long shot. He holds her and they lie silently for a moment--
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
What's this I see? Is that whiskey in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, I'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law--
If he hadn't found that Deputy job, I believe Buddy might've gone down the other path, got into some serious trouble. Settled him right down. That and your mother. 'Course he had that other one later.
Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.
I know you?
I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich sees me talking to you.  He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole.
Why?
How'd you spell that again?
D'Amour.
I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
Don't.
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
Will you come to him on your knees?
Ever watched a man die?  If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. And if you're very quick, you can catch it.
Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm.
What's the connection?
You don't believe me.
Sorry.  You asked.
That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.
How did it go today?
He taught all this to Swann?
Nothing's going to happen to you.
I've got to help him.
Valentin?
... they believe you.
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?
What were you doing up there?
Trickery and divinity.
With what?
Go away.
Nah.  You're driving it too carefully.
Who is she?
Was that Swann's idea?
Him too.
My God.
The Puritan?
For an introduction.
You think I'm an asshole.
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
Nix! Nix!
Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
And?
How long have you been married?
I'm thinking about it.
What did you study?
Oh, what do you do with that?
Hi again, how's it going?
Oh, hi.
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
Not really. How long are you here for?
Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs.
Really?
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
Nice one.
You think so?
Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
Charlotte?
He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.
Hello?
Hi, Lydia.
I don't know.
I guess she's busy.
How do you say "hospital" in Japanese?
How'd it go today?
I don't know what to do.
Like popcorn?
See you later.
Oh, the record company sent these...
Are you sure you want to stay?
I miss you.
John! What are you doing here?
You never said anything to me...
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef.
You're glad somebody tried to kill me?
What're these?
He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
George, come in.  What the hell happened to you?
Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you.  And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.
You fucking bastard.
You raised me, like a son.
You killed my parents.
Why are you doing this to me?
So I guess Satan lost.  Satan is the weak one.
Ooooooh-kayyyyyy.
I do.
Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?
We need to talk.
We needed to know all we could.
Get up!!
And what are you thinking we should do now?
Sometimes I can just feel the numbers.
Seems George isn't making too many friends in lockup.
Thanks for handling this.
What's up?
She came to me with a wild story about demonic possession.
She told me she killed them.
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart.
That was nice.
Wait...
I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me.
I don't know sometimes.
A horse?
I don't know how to walk in heels.
Hey, munchkin.
That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman.
You were trying to make me look bad.
I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
You ever think about going back?
One, up.
I never knew a girl that could play.
Your Dad play?
My Dad plays for the "Clippers."  He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too.  Same number and everything.
How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.
I think we gotta kiss now.
I want to ride my own bike.
What's that?
And?
See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
I'm not the one who put this scar here.
Didn't know you cared so much.
See you made it.
Hey.
Early night for you, isn't it?
Four.
Didn't realize you were watching the clock.
You want to go talk?
I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
So...I guess I'll see you around.
What are the doctors saying?
So, how's pro-ball, Europe?
Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
You asked me what was missing.
I heard enough.
One game.  One-on-one.
So?
I had some players to see and hands to shake.
Fine, then how many nights home is that?
Not great.
Guess he talked to you.
Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?
You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The NBA ain't going nowhere.
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
Why?
I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
You okay?  huh?  Jimmy?
Yeah, hey. Chad.
What do you want? Why are you here?
I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
Get out of here, get the fuck out of my house --
What?
No.
got some coffee brewing, huh?
It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --
Well if you listen' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we'll share another cup of coffee --
I'm sorry, Claudia.
Please, yes.
I don't know.  I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it.  I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.
You wanna make a deal with me?
I'll take everything at face value. I'll be a good listener to you.
-- you the resident here?
No, what's wrong?
Have you ever been there?
I'm wondering about the weather department. I'm wonderin' wether or not the weather people use outside meteorlogical services or if they have in-house instruments?
Not enough, what do you want?
DADDY! DAD! DAD WHAT THE HELL IS GOIN' ON?
GIVE US YOUR MONEY MAN.
I'm trained, I'm ready to go, you wanna buy some candy to help underprivelaged youth in the --
Tell me what you know, I'll tell you what I know --
I need you to interupt him, I need to get him on the phone with me right away --
Phil, hang in just one more minute ok?  I'm gonna put you on hold -- Doc you still there?
I paid you back.
And how much is braces?
-- he's fucking dying, he's dying as we're sitting here and there isn't a fucking thing -- jesus, how can you tell me to calm down?
I need to sit down.
"yeah."  the fuck do you know?
...cocksucker....
...gimme that fuckin' phone...
No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?
She had cancer...from her...in her stomach and I didn't go anywhere with her...and I didn't do a god thing... for her and to help her....shit...this bitch...the beautiful, beautiful bitch with perfect skin and child bearing hips and so soft...her namewasLilysee?  He liked her though he did, his mom, Frank/Jack...he took care of her and she died. She didn't stick with him and he thinks and he hates me, ok...see...I'm...that's then what you get? ....are you still walkin' in that car...?
-- that's right, that's right, and what I'M saying, that none of my competitors can say is this:  That there is no need for insight or understanding.  Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done. Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is? How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of it's time this concept is?  I'm talking about eliminating <u>insight</u> and <u>understanding</u> as human values.  GOD DAMN I'M GOOD.  There is no need for INSIGHT.  There is no need for UNDERSTANDING.  I have found a way to take <u>any</u> subjective human experience -- in other words -- all the terrible shit or all the great shit that you've had happen to you in your life -- and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language.  The "listener-patient"  settles into a very light, very delicate, conversationally induced state: NOT A TRANCE, mind you, but a STATE. A state that is brand new.  The System's state. What did I do?  I REALIZED that concept and put it into practical "get my dick hard and fuck it" use. I'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party 'till dawn.  I'm gonna teach methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail --
I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
This isn't meant --
It's all important --
She does.  From when you were a boy.
C'mon, Frank.  What are you doing?
They wouldn't?
Kind of.
Are you asking me a question?
How long...you think?
When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
So....Phil....um...I think I'm gonna step in and try and see him and say something if he can...talk...I mean:
I AM CALM.
No.  I said that.
No I Said.
I don't know a loud crash.
You on any medication?
No. No. Stay down, Marcie, sit back down on that couch --
WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE --
You look great.
Come and tell me it's over and I'll walk away, Jimmy.  I've fucked you behind your wife's back for three years, and you've fucked teenage girls behind mine for the same amount of time -- I'll walk away, you need something for your life, for your conscience, but don't put me in the middle --
Did you tell her?
No.  No.
You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins?  Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --
No.
I think that you know.
Yes you do.
I don't want him to die, I didn't love him when we met, and I've done so many bad things to him that he doesn't know, things I want to confess to him, but now I do: I love him. I love him so much and I can't stand -- he's going.
Where will the money go?
listen...listen to me now, Phil: I'm sorry, sorry I slapped your face. ...because I don't know what I'm doing... ...I don't know how to do this, y'know? You understand?  y'know?  I...I'm...I do things and I fuck up and I fucked up....forgive me, ok? Can you just...
What would you like?
Ok.
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
The fuck is wrong with you?
Stanley if you don't fuckin' stand up and go over there I'm gonna beat your ass --
You ready to keep winning?
Why didn't you answer those questions?
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
God smiled upon us.
Oh God I -- Forgive me...
I am preparing for a ball!
Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
D'Artagnan, arrest them all!
It can.  I know the way.
Tonight!  Right now!  We steal a man from a royal prison, we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide, and still you wish to tell me nothing?!
He who is not with us is against us.
You can do it.
Three days.
Go on.
Poor Phillippe!
Where are you going?!
What you're asking is impossible!
But --
Once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river.
Forgiveness.
Where are we?
The greatest secret of life is who we truly are.  Now I must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life.  It began on the night when Louis was born.
But why?
You've been moping for months.  Now that you've gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way, you can stop boring me and start being useful to me.  Now get some rest.
D'Artagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky.
Can we eat... before we go?  This excitement's given me an appetite.
He gets one day of confession each year.  Today is the day.
What do we do now?
D'Artagnan, unready?
This cannot be.  Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king!
He lies.  He is here to trap us.
What is that?
I've worn this mask so long, I couldn't sleep without it.
The room of the King's favorite mistress?
The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.
Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
I already know about the riots, d'Artagnan, I heard them out there whispering.  Some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food.  I will deal with it tomorrow.
Your Majesty.  This ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking --
Your Majesty...?
Food, moron.
You've... memorized...?
Now.  Where is d'Artagnan?
Sire!  I -- How did you --
Shall I leave?
Did you know... about Raoul?
Raoul... Oh, Raoul...
What can I do for you?
We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years.
Our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.
I'm sure if our departments cooperate we can find out the truth.
Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker, you know, some connection.
What?  Wait a minute -
Did you read today's paper?
Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?
Where up north?
You know, you don't seem afraid of much either.  How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you?
Why did you set me up?
Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want.  That's where I met him - told him what I had.  The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow.  So I ran...and met you.
Holy shit -
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!
Remember when you asked for a study on him, I refused. Same goes for now.
I wouldn't presume to try.
He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you?
Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call?
...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...
Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD.  Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes.  Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up.
Get me a plane...
You got the message Lecktor called...
It's not over yet.
It's the guard in the storeroom.
Not yet.
Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock.
The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code.  It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do?
You worked out well.
I'll probably go back to it someday.
The developing room.  I need to... see you.
No. Reba...?
Who is it?
Do you feel privileged?
Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?
Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds.
Do you see?
Do you have it?
Can you read it to me?
Linda doesn't come in nights.
This is Will Graham. Can I help you?
Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in?
He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
That's all we know about.  Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin...  He bites a lot.
To yourself...
I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
Let's forget who said what to whom...
It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson?
Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too...
We're fine. Fine. We're all well. We're okay!  That man, Crawford, called and... told me...  ...how 'bout a drink? Coffee or something?
Did the girl die?
And?
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
May I keep the file?
Caspiar?  I haven't heard of that.
Andy, c'mon IN!  Thanks for flyin' out here!!
Andy... this is every comedian's dream.
You have to do it.
Okay.  Fine, I'll do it.  But I have a few terms.
Are you makin' fun of me --?  This is RIDICULOUS!
How long would they let me sleep?
Oh dear!  George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break.
No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.
So how can I help you...?
B-but I have them.
B-but... we saw... your neck...
Andy... uhh... this network has a long-standing policy: The viewer must be able to see the program.
Right...
And all this will be for real?
Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?
You're not listening to me --
I'm gonna quit.
It's so dirty.
Look at this!  An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty!  Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy!
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
I was very original!
Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
Positive.
Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!
Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
That was a really hot house!
Hmph!  They sure didn't give Andy much to do.
JESUS CHRIST!!!!!
A -- a tourist.
They are dead.  In either case --
You don't know.
The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.
That's the third white van I've seen.
You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?
Thanks... for the drink.
We found him, Trinity.  We finally found him.
No way, no way, this is crazy.
This line is tapped so I must be brief.
Why not?
When?
I thought it wasn't real.
If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?
Set down in there.
And she's never wrong.
No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!
Got it.
You're cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you.
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
Hello, Neo.
That was a long time ago.
Of what?
Who is?
But an Oracle can.
Is it?
What is it?
What happened?
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
No, you... have to be.
No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.
No one has ever done anything like this.
You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
What are they doing to him?
Neo, this is loco.  They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building.  Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him.  Three of them!  I want Morpheus back, too, but what you are talking about is suicide.
Operator.
It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?
Yeah.
'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
Where to?
I won't wait until Tuesday.  I'll break your arms right now.
Don't come any closer!!!
I don't get involved with anything, you understand that?  Nothing!  I'm clean as far as you know...right?
Shut up!
Oh, cut it out, will ya?
Back so soon.
Hey...you're here.  They told me you're here...and you're here.  How are you?
I should know?  His wife don't even know.  Probably off with one of his little girls...I don't know.  I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn...Why should I kill myself?
...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me?  I think you should be, you know that.
I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?
Disgraceful.
Charlie, this is business.
He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...
Where's the rest?
No...no stripping...as the hostess.
It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...
Take your time.  I don't care.
The building on the corner.  That one!  He's been on the roof a half hour now!
Don't count it...it's all there.
and a double for you and Charlie here.  And put it on my tab, willya?
You mean it's heisted.
Hi, everybody.  Sorry to be late -- had to have dinner with my depart- ment chief --
What, honey?
I don't like cake.
Honey, please.
And that?
What do you do that for?
Red or white?
Well... goodnight.
Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney now?  Are we going to go to court? Or are we going to go to bed?  And I don't mean you and me.  I mean you and him.
We have an arrangement now.
Yes.
Yes.
Perhaps you could remind me.
'Joe...'
Have we met?
...Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion.
Whose?
I think it's time you went home, Drew.
I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.
Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?
In English, please.
You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
But I didn't mean to do it!
This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart.
He said that?
I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right?
C'mon, have a drink.  You look like you need one bad as me.
Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
Yes --?
Joe --
Very well, I'll watch.
Yes...
I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today.
I'm sorry about --
I like you in a black tie.
Well -- I --
I can tell you the when part.  Tonight.
You think so?
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
Joe --?
I want to live.
And more.
How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.
I'll be the judge of that.
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
You're violating the laws of the universe.
Uh --
You are?
-- And I'm in love with your daughter.
Okay.
He is --
It just occurred to me --
What do you mean?!
What question?
I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
Well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than I bargained for.  I just wanted to set the record straight.
Well, it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.
I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either.
You're terrible.
What?!
Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
I won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --
You don't know anything about Joe --
Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.
I love him.
You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere --
What was that?
Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.
Oh yeah?  What was 'fascinating' about it?
I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy.  He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it.  One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
...It's kind of a pro bono job.
78.
66.
Should I wear it?
Condition?
Like waking. Like you always just woke up.							 *
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, But I've misplaced my key.
No, let's go.
Business is slow. I told my boss about You, about your condition. He told me to Try and rent you another room.
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, but I've misplaced my key.
Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny.
Then you shouldn't have to ask.
* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *
I wrote an address in there, too. Might be useful. It's this abandoned place outside of town. I guy I know used to use it for his bigger deals.
How do I know he did that to you?
So I just take your word?
What?
It's not easy to be calm when -
Who?
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
Don't talk about my wife.
Yes.
They're not looking for him.
My name's Leonard.							 *
I don't know. I'm sorry.
I can't make new memories. Everything			  * fades, nothing sticks. By the time we finish this conversation I won't remember how it started, and the next time I see you I won't know that I've ever met you before.
Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    * Why are we going there?
We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
So what are you gonna do now?
What do you mean "bad news"?
How'd you know I was in here?
You're not coming?
He might have fallen down the stairs, I don't know, I don't know what's going on, I'm confused. I have this memory thing - do I know you?
My wife wasn't diabetic.
You probably.							 *
Your name's Teddy.
What was it for?							   *
Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
...eliminated one.  SWAT's on the next two...
There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product...
What do you like to drink?
Where's that?
The Keys?
How's he not your husband?
I insist.
Blanca...a rubio like you.  I see her in a dress...an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding...everybody is with couples.  Husbands and wives.  They all pose.  My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting.  ...she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room.  By herself.  In a party dress.  And she looked like she knew she would die alone...  She spoke many languages.  We were in Luanda when she died.  I went to her friends in Mali.  They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos.  He had banking there...I was seventeen and very much into the clubs.  And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance.  Your mother?
Where would I go?
Yero, by himself?
If they attack you...
What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail?  You think I will turn into your informant, is that it?
I do.  We don't do business with him...
Yeah.
Yeah?
What is it?
Stevens?
Track with me, here...  They knew the "Russians" were undercover Feeb?  They should have no-showed.  But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers.  And steal all your money...  What does that say to you?
So?
And specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs.
There is "undercover."  And there is "Which way is up?"
Guy's involved in a "meet"...
How?
Out of...?
Yeah.
Alonzo...!
You okay?
Equipment?
And violence is extra.  And expensive.  So how much weight you looking to move?
This the load you lost a while back?
Transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd.
I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
If you didn't talk so much, maybe you could think more.
Oh hell, forget it.
You keep the sixty-four cents. I want you to have it.
I'm impressed. You're a killer.
Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty little bastard, Ratso.
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
What'll happen. I mean what they do to, you know, do with you -- if you can't -- ah, Christ!
Okay. Here it is. You gonna go see the doctor. I got nine bucks and twenty more Thursday and I gonna be riding high before you know it. So you gonna get you the best goddam doctor in this town and get yourself straightened out, that's what.
You know what's wrong with you? You got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug. How you gonna get to Florida?
A drink? I've got some nice gin. If you'd prefer something else, they'll send it up...
This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built? Ten bucks she wanted. Three of us made a deal for, twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain?
Sold. Let's go.
Looks like a cheap hotel.
Yeah.
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
You got that, shit face? Asina...
What?
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.
No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
Right!  That's what we're shooting for.  Mister Davis and have been in contact with the State Department, but right now relations with the Turks aren't too good, Nixon's upset the hell out of them. Our best bet's... right here.
Where'd you get that limp?
Why'd you do it, Billy?
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...
Got a family back there?
How's it feel?
What they give you?
You just got to get yourself a good lawyer.  And some money... Talk to Max.  He's been in the longest.
The Prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in Ankara reviewed it.
You got your stuff?
Shit!  Shit!  Shit!
Oh we... we...
What?
It's already been cut.
Hishradyo.
Why the suit?
Susan - forget it. Go get us a seat on the plane. Now.
You really love flashing that thing, don't you?
Funny.  Shoulda seen some track bunnies by now.
A mistake.
Can we get this car there?
You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?
The kid...
What are you doing down here?
It would take a minute or so.  You won't last that long out there.
Honey, just leave it.
It's me. Can you hear me?
No...
Excuse me, that's not exactly the kind of information I was after. You see, he's been missing for quite some time now, and...
Must get lonely, living out here all by yourself.
Your legs just sing grand opera when you move, don't they?  It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, I promise you.
I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.
What's it about?
No, what is it?
The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you.
I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?
Don't get me wrong. I'm not against marriage per se. But it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again.
What are you doing on the floor?  It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in.  I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?
You want me to burn my book?
Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it.  Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world...
I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again.
What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word.
What about a bee...?
Paul, this is positively the best Misery you've ever written.
Annie, what is it?
Oh, Paul. It's beautiful.
I was fooling, silly.  You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne.  Dome Pear-igg-non.
Yes, Paul.
Virginia, when you're in this car, you're not my wife, you're my deputy.
Could be the weight of the snow.
Here's the list of all Sheldon's credit charges. Nothing after the Silver Creek.  Any calls?
Just leave it, all right?
I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble.
When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
Sorry I'm late. Jenny's basketball game went into overtime. If anybody ever told me I'd have a daughter who'd get a triple double, I'd...
Yeah. They're in the semis.
The word I'm getting is the Times review is gonna be a love letter.
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
I like it. Remember how you once said I live my whole life as if I'm in danger of being found out? Well, I believe I've managed to get that guy down on paper.  Don't think I'm completely nuts, but in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole experience, helped me.
Not everything.  Why do you think she's really here?
I thought you were going to dinner.
I said you're beautiful, Nyah.
You won.
You picked another winner!
Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.
Feel like pleading for your life?
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
There it is, guys, the last of it.
Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
Before we kill her or cure her..
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.
Uh-huh.
Where's the bloody -
Under the circumstances I think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load.  How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?
May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
Hola..
When they've got your recruiting technique?  Not a thing.
So where did I got right?
But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief.
And that's the only reason?
Much.
Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message.  Not after the way we broke up.
We know him.  He's over your left shoulder, looking right at you as you go on..
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?
I managed.
What did you think of him?
- good.  Then if you manage to get hold of Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got -  - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera on earth.
No, I don't.  But in this case -
..not in time to save him.
I don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic.  Get me a twenty on Nyah.
You have Bellerophon.
You still don't get it, do you?  You want to make an omelet, you break a few eggs - <i>I needed to know just how bad the disease was</i> - in the real world, not the lab.  And you never know til you try.  You thought you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza to create a cure for all influenzas.  But I saw you creating a disease so terrible in <i>Chimera</i> that the cure would be priceless.
You and I know about this -- and that's where it stops.  Understand?  It never happened.
Whatís Hunt doing on the TGV?
You were in the car!
There was nobody on the bridge.
What are you going to do?
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
Max made a deal with you?
Kittridge...
Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley.  Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  Follow me?
I don't quite follow you.
Krieger <u>did</u> have the NOC list.
What makes you trust me?
It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be close.
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
Who are you and what are you doing here?
The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
How will you make sure Job will be there?
Wait!  Hold it - it's on. Let's go.
Merci.
He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack.
OK.  Taking Golitsyn's exit.  Jack, open the doors.
Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Iím coming to you.
Would you remove your hat please?
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
Before London.  But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.
Arenít you going to thank me Jim.  Ten million is better than six.
No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now?
Too wicked to have a drink later?
Such a nice ass.
Oh, you're not going. You're staying.
No, I want to see the dessert cart.
I don't wanna talk about it.
You're welcome.
Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.
Okay.
Here.  Ti amo. 
You look tired.
I'm getting married.
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that I was right.
Why you looking around so much?
Have you come from my brother?
I have no life.
Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!
Where'd Johnny find you?
Why?
I don't know.
She was right to leave me.
Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
I was dead.
I've got you.
What?
Oh my God.
What did I do?
Kinda gaudy.
No thanks.
What's the matter?
I'm afraid of who I am.
Let me go home.
I'm freezing to death.
What's the matter? You look crazy.
Bye, Aunt Rita.
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
What's the matter?
Will you marry me?
You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck.
Alright. A month. In a month.
Yeah.
In time, you will see that this is the best thing.
Did he tell her?
What? He's in Sicily!
We just come from the bank.
I know.
I know.
Alright.
Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
That's it! That's the reason!
I'm sure she did.
May I walk with you a ways?
You knew that man?
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
Cosmo.
She's got it.
Get away!
A what?
What word?
I move for no man.
You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
All right, we'll call it a draw.
Hello.
Are you sure he's got one?
Now what happens?
What?
What?
What manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint or tinder?
Too late.
Je...sus Christ!
Old woman!
Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
:I'm thirty-seven ... I'm not old.
... But all the decision of that officer ...
... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs.
The nose?
He will be soon. He's very ill.
I think I'll go for a walk.
Bring out your dead!
I can't.
Thanks very much.
Who's that then?
I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir.
'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....
Do you want to come and have a drink?
Where are you going?
The Castle Anthrax?
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
When you have found the shrubbery, place the shrubbery here, beside this shrubbery ... only slightly higher, so you get a two-level effect with a path through the middle.
You tit.  I soiled my armour I was so scared!
I done it again.
How much?
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
It's only grief makes her like she is.
She loved him.
She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does.  You want to be careful.
She'll get over it.
My lips may give a message better of Christmas love than e'en this letter.  To my best friend, J.B. from his best friend, V.R.  Best friend!
Hey, Barney.
The order of seating at the Upper Servant's table is arranged personally by the Queen herself.
If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked.
This is a slur on her good name.
Oh.
Surely --
Was there never ambition?
Mr Brown.
You are here safely.
Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.
Mr Brown.
Then why do you persist in doing it?
I am told so.
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
John?
I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this.  I leave for Deeside --
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
Forgive me, gentlemen.  I'm late.
Your Majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance.  As for your people, look no further than the sales of your Highland Journals to see in what affection the nation holds their Queen.  You sell even more copies than Mr Dickens.
Then they may read about me.
I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.
What's her excuse this time?
We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?
How long has he been this sick?
We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It was most agreeable.
Read it.
Why not?
What do they want?
That's a very pretty shawl you are wearing, Alex.  Silk suits you well.  But you are not eating enough.  One must not let vanity overrule one's appetite.
Why is he not here?
What's the riddle?
How the hell did you do that?
Sick?
Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium.
Jesus Christ!
You got the schematics?
It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.
I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
So that's what we almost died for?
Christ...no time...
What is it?
Listen to me, Alex.  These counselor's don't know anything.  They're full of shit. If you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak.
So tell me you're okay, then.
Which way?
It's the wrong way!
I'm thinking!
Is...is that where we are?  Did I die?
So how do I start?
But I'm not broke.
Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.
Will you meet with him?
What did I say?
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
So, what did they say?
I guess I've come to quite a place.
Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.
Can you tell me what happened?
Yes?
No...I need to sleep.
No.... I don't...
What's wrong with that?
"You're still here?"
"Before I kill you."
Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!
No... but...
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
Nice wallets.
I'll do the standard research and have them in by midnight, pending any unforseen problems.
Why should we trust you ?
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
It won't take them that long to figure out we weren't on the train when it wrecked.
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
There's more to it than trying to see if you'd steal from the company or if you'd lie or cheat.
You okay ?
What about you ?
Are you Matthew Parker ?
What's next Walt ?
He's the liaison for McCay. Listen go. Go now.
I didn't think he'd make it past Scraps.
Never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes. His file says he is an avid jogger.
When I think you're ready.
You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?
Zachory ! My boy, how goes the carnage down on 44 ?
Thank you, sir. I was really hoping for shares, or possibly cash... but this, this is really personal.
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
No. I was just curious if what I heard about you is true ?
Have you ever considered running your own "Park" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.
I had hoped you would say that. I have a proposal for you.....
So what's next ? No one's ever made it this far before.
The power went out in half the park.
Come on, I'm serious. Look at Wilma. She's this frail little thing, and Fred, I mean Fred Flintstone is this BIG guy. He has to be hung like a horse, and THAT's why Wilma puts up with his B.S.
Hello.
Okay, now go under go under it ! Shoot Vader's Tie Fighter ! Get Him Get Him !
I'm talking to you asshole !
You don't have to sound so emphatic.
It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?
Hey good lookin' ! What'cha got cookin' ?
No sir. I was just getting , well you know. Water. We weren't talking about sex or anything else except Star Wars. Just saying hello. I think I'm gonna go now.
I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?
We start with the top and work our way down. We start with the high salaries and then just let the little people go. No need to make the blue collars go crazy.
You had to remind me?
This is California, anything is possible.
Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem.
I don't think you're very polite.
Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.
Yeah, this is Sergeant Tanaka from Holenbeck, I need a current address for a Jeffrey....
Ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. No, this talk isn't about sex, it's, well there've been a lot of changes, and I know you're upset about losing your room, but the baby's gotta go somewhere.
Dad, when a boy likes you, does he pretend that he doesn't like you? And if he pretends that he doesn't like you how can you tell that he likes you?
I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
Totally.
Oh, Shell, that's ridiculous, where are my needle nosed pliers?
Never heard of him. 
Reason? What reason?
Thanks.
Sure am, who are you?
Maggie wanted to have a baby...and...umm...I didn't.
My mother can't have any more kids.
Then what did she do?
All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?
Hi there...can I help you?
But we made a business deal.
My parents had a brief, but intensely fulfilling relationship. She's remained a woman of mystery to this day.
You know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit.
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude.
Get married?
I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.
Do you think your friend's up in Heaven now, looking down on you and watching you all the time?
I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors.
Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.
Come and get it.
Just come and get it...right here!
Uh oh...
...I dropped it.
What's he smoking?
That thing you said about your nose...it was a stranger's nose...well it's not...it's...I mean...it's yours...you know?
Muh??
Wow!
Well then that's not exactly dating is it.
Do you think I should tell my dad about Jeffrey Pommeroy?
A secret, I like that.
What's with the touching, why was he touching you?
Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
...It's all in the hands really. You know you have nice hands, you operate?
Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me.
Do you know him?
Of what??
Danny?
The boss is watching us...
It's there.
I need the job.
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
Harry?  I was just wondering, if there is anything wrong with Vada.
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
Can not do without, Harry's wild about me.
Oh it's good, &quot;In lieu of&quot; I love that word lieu.
I had a good time tonight.
Do you want to?
How's it going chef?
Shelly?
Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead.
Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Of course not.
Are they ready yet?
Maybe I should go over and yell at him.
Why not?
I found this.
Why?
That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house?
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
Who's winning?
He won't give it to me.
Hi.
Did you read ALL these books?
Vada? Would you like us to get you another goldfish?
Where's Daddy?
I think it should be outlawed.
Oh great!
I knew he wouldn't come.
At what?
Maybe they had a big breakfast.
If I do it, can we go?
Your lip bleeding?
Hmmmm, interesting.
Is that your Dad?
Pacifist!
THIS!! 
Woah!!
Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to boys.
Seeya tomorrow.
Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.
Blood oath.
This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.
Zit cream?
I'll think about it.  I'm okay.
My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor...
But I can't be dry.
This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...
I thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress.
I'm excited Sports Illustrated gave him this kind of shot, he's only there a ye...
It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...
But he sure can kiss.
I'm not joking.  I had to face up to all my competitive drives, and believe me, I've got 'em.
Jesus, we're trapped!
I mean, he loves his job.
Ex-cuse me?
Julianne, reading my son-in-law's mail, is not something...
Well, that's great.  You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee...
Well, the Sox are at home.  SI's letting me do a profile on the Big Hurt.  That's Frank...
Well, maybe we should talk ab...
Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.
No matter how many times I leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down.
Waiter! Check, please!
Should I whistle down a cab?
Last zoo we were in was... Beijing, yeah?  Sure.  The rhinos were fucking.
No problem.  A little bullshit about Daddy's "needs," and presto, I'm a lap dog in high society.
Kim has all this stuff to do, I hardly see her.
I wouldn't know.  I never had that many first thoughts.
Listen up, huh? Even if you blow this deal, how big could it be?
Michael? What ha...
Does that make it right...
I never forgot that.
It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him...
Kimberly wanted to tickle the grandmas, so we figured, give 'em a cheap thrill.  Walter supplied the decorative touches...
... I'm partial to the tight end.
And yet here you are.  All celibate and reclusive.
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
Barnett, please -
Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.
Hi. I'm John Triplette.
Where'd he ever see us?
Yes, but we're just singing.
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
He is just wonderful.
We don't mess with accessories.
Parts.
What year?
I feel really good.
Well, can you tell me why?
Do you ever do any writing?
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
Well...How have you been?
Doesn't it have a name?
When did you think it would happen?
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
I was in prison for twenty-eight years.
Premeditated murder.
What time?
I can do benefits
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
That's for sure. At the airport - that's where it was. At the airport, there in one of those gift shops... Anyway, you better take a break.
Oh, no.
Dent it a little. Boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. She had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.
Ryan O'Neal.
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
Now, while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject, I have heard of Bruce Lee. And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of the, if not <u>the</u> greatest fighter in the history of martial arts.
Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?
Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing...
What kind of pies do you have?
I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take it easy. Just enjoy each other's company, stop and smell the roses, notice the color purple, stuff like that.
Divine intervention.
Looked like an interview to me.
Who is we?
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
Who isn't?
They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
So can we. So the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to Nystrom Asylum for the criminally insane.
Because they wouldn't give them their blessing for marriage.
Yeah.
Yes.
Manson beat you.
Mickey, how do you feel about cross- examining Grace Mulberry?
Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue?
Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.
...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward R. Murrow award among others.' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. You getting the idea?
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.
Let's make a little music, Colorada.
I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
Now we got to film a new intro for the follow up episode. But we put the intro for the first episode at the beginning temporarily so you can see it with some scope.
Roger?
And where do you keep Mickey?
Waitin' in the lounge.
So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and planning the interview.  You two go down to the editing bay, take the old footage and the new footage, put it together, and see what we got. Get it into shape so when we finish the interview, we can just stick it in.
How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
I'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a Coke.
Want to talk to you.
Look, boy, we got a smooth operation here, and I aim to keep it that way. Now I got an idea you're plannin' trouble.
What d'you want?
Well, she never gave me none. Look, you better find him a place pretty quick.
They say your dad's 'round town.
His profession?
Any other family?
Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
Thank you, Ma'am. That's fine.
You working?
Your folks live there?
Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
Well, let's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty-eight times.
You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
Ain't your fault.
Surprised?
What's he like?
Thank you.
It sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. I seen hundreds of them - all my life.
Ain't that something?!  That's just fine, baby.
Duff, I love you.
Ain't you goin' to say something?
Okay.
I guess you'll be making' some changes 'round here.
Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?
Seems a little loose!
Come back some other time, will you?
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
Ol' Doris sure goin' to miss you.
I'll talk to the Mayor.
No. Why?
Got a thick feelin' here.
What are you doing in here?
The corporate plundering of Yeshoto Industries... At first these seemed like unrelated incidents, but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise.
Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
There are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries. They're dissolving, Case... slowly, but they're definitely dissolving. You have just long enough to do the job.
Why'd you do it, Armitage?
That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.
Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear.
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
Yeah, well it's working.
You've got your orders.
An odd selection, Mr Case.
Tell me the words.
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
We're doing fine. Take the next right.
Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.
What?
It's mutating... spreading like a disease.
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
Wait... You hear that?
Want to fucking answer them?
Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
Where did you here that?
What about before that?
How soon is soon enough?
Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
On a good run... yeah.
I'll get the car.
He projects with neural implants.
I know.
Once I kicked, I swore I wouldn't let that happen again. I apprenticed a razor girl in Osaka. Went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up. Been taking care of myself just fine ever since.
The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it.
My God... these people are insane.
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
How long will they watch us for?
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
Remember, that poet that we liked – the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets.
It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
My own undercover feature - "Written by Josie Geller".
Now this is cute.
Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?
Josie, you have totally transitioned.
Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica?
Uhh, no.
This is where the stories are. You are going to become friends with these people. You are going to party with them. You are going to hang out with them on weekends. When they go to prom, you are going to be in their same damn limo!
Do you even know these kids?
That's your story!
Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed.  Yikes.  Bikes!
Hey there.
I'm sure you've probably heard that I want to ask you, but I'd like to know if you'd go to prom with me. I know we Didn't hit it off right at the beginning but-
Rufus.  But I don't even know where you live.
Hey--what are you thinking about?
God, I can't do this.
Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
Hi, everyone.  I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.
Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
This seat taken?
Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
You set me up. For a story.  You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
Hi. I'm Tracy and I'm sixteen and I'm a gymnast and I don't have a boyfriend...
Wow - I-
Not at all!
Yes.
What trail are you trying to throw me off now?
But I have to go out. Something's happening out there.
<i>                      That's the point of the thing, not to know!</i>
<i>                      I say that we take a cannon Aim it at his door and then Knock three times and when he answers Sandy Claws will be no more.</i>
That's Lisa - I gotta get to school.
Oh, come on, Shirl, how'd you think we got such a good deal?  Listen - all old houses have stories.
What are you doing here?
You're fucked in the head.
I believe you.  You had some scary dreams, okay?
You okay?
You mean a shithead.
I think it's sad...
This is amazing!  Your dream told you where this was?
That's when she started talking about Fred Krueger.
No. Never.  You think that's what it is?
What about "essential energy" the soul.  Does that go into the air too?  You think there's a good energy and a bab energy?
You want to talk about it?
'Morning.
Jess?
We're going up to bed now.
I'll need to take her things.
Are you crazy?  You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Can we talk?  Just for a minute?
What's happening?
Crossed over?
Tell me about the kids.
This is nice.
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
I can't believe I just did that.
What are we going to do?
What'd you do, take the scenic route?
Okay, straight talk only in here.
And you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are.
That's precisely what they need.  Some uninterrupted REM sleep to release all this negative energy.
I could've saved them.
The whole facility was shut down in the Forties, wasn't it?  Some kind of scandal...
I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a little accident, as you can see.
Why is he after us?
Lovely to meet you.
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
No, thanks.  I'll just look around.
Thank you.
I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  Disaster...
No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
Hi.
I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life.  Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you.
Too complicated.
Gardens.  All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little villages.
Here we are.  Do you want to come up?
Why?
These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
Cartwright.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
This is certainly... ah...
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
Can I have your autograph?
Yup.
No!
That's nice.
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
What do you think?  Good move?
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
I suppose so.
I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
Max.  This is Anna.
Do you ever masturbate?
Oh God no.
Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
Try 'Flintstone.'
I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?
Oh my God...  Hello.
Yes.
Spike!
What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan.
Was it you?
What's going on?
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
And yet you suspect her.
Why?
Yes, Mister Harding?
Easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got lots of games ahead of us...
Mister McMurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. However, the cardinal rule, and I must emphasize this: Everyone keeps their seat during the meeting!
Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here.
Pardon me, ma'am, can I ask you somethin'?
How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
On this ward?
Yeah?
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
You men remain seated!
That's okay, kid...
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
So long suckers.
Yeah, kid?
Shit! This is too much!  Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em.
Wait a minute...
She won't give me any more cigarettes!
Let's go, for Christsakes...
Ha! Did ya see that!  Hey, Cheswick!
Yeah, Mack?
Yeah, where we going?
What?
Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe anyway?
Ya know what, Fred?
What are you doing?
Twenty-five dollars.
What's your plan, Mack?
Gimme a cigarette!
Right!
Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!
Ten bucks.
Yeah, we'll miss breakfast!
What you boys doin' up at this ungodly time o' the night?
You comin' in to hold my hand?
Maybe I'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, Sefelt.
Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.
Of course.  Mister McMurphy.
Well, Miss... I would say... I would say, yes. Yes, he's crazy.
He is your husband, no?
Great.  Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.
There's this poem by Rilke, I don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that.  About waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them.  And the last line of it goes, "Who knows?  Perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--
We found each other, didn't we?
I'm a liberal!
...has a prior commitment.
Congratulations.
Smoking or non-smoking?
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
Where are you going?
Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
Don't you see?..  We're not the ones who are meant to be.  You're the man of somebody else's dreams.
He's out by the pool right now.
You were saying...
Why are you doing this?
How about music?  You like classical?
I'm sorry.
No.  Are you're leaving?
Don't you think you're overreacting just a little here?   We're talking about love, okay?  Let's be rational.
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
Very funny.
Sure.
So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.
I don't have an Amana freezer.
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him.
I understand, Kate.  What do you think of this garter?
It's still the new year...
I can't believe we did this.  Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
Your brother?
You think he misses me at all?
That was a long time ago.
He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day.  Did I tell you that?
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
Right, right...  Okay..  You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?
Faith--
I think it's time we got some professional help.
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Hi-iii...
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
Kate is that you?
I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?
How old are you?
Damon Bradley?  That's why you're here?
And you didn't tell her?
I'll come over when I'm ready.
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth—
After what we been hearing about your brother, I thought your throat'd be kind of dry.
What do you want me to do, Johnny?
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
River Street? I thought we was going to the Garden.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
—ex-tanker who's walking on his heels— ?
Wow... .
You know how the Sisters are.
In braids? That's right.
The moment I saw you.
I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop.
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or— or human kindness in your whole body.
Yeah, yeah, it's up to me, it's up to me— he says it's up to me.
Edie...
Thanks just the same.
Am I on my feet...?
A look in his eyes! Hold your hats, brother, here we go again. You think he's one of those cases you're always draggin' in and feelin' sorry for. Like the litter of kittens you had—the only one she wants to keep has six toes and it's cockeyed to boot. Look at him. The bum! And the crush you had on that little Abyssinian... .
What's the matter? I've got something That's chokin' me. I've gotta get it out.
But you've got to listen to me.
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
Nice fellows.
You can bring a lawyer if you wish. And you're privileged under the Constitution to protect yourself against questions that might implicate you in any crimes.
Yeah. Johnny Friendly and my brother had other ideas.
Yeah. My own blood— and they sell me out for a lousy bet— I had it in me to hit the top and—  Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you about them guys— 
Really?
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
You're doin' lovely, Terry, very lovely.
Better.
A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!
You ought to go home and take care of that—
Nothing happened, he says. Some operator you got yourself there, Charley. One more like him and we'll all be wearing striped pajamas.
Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.
He don't, huh?  Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?
But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
Something's making that music.
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
What do you mean?
Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic won't do us any good!  Let me think. We've got to stall for time.
I am--It's our only chance.
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
I love you Bob. I really do. Forgive me?
She pleases me.  Permit her to live in the World of the Snakes. 
Yes, yes yes I know all that.
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
No. No! No!
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
You did work for Emil, right?
You were his what, his box?
I'm not dressed.
I don't know where he is.
Go away, or I'll call the police.
Do we need him?
I'm just saying she wasn't scared.
They pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want, nobody'll know you.
There.  You see the guy sitting on the porch?  The old ladies and one guy? You know they'll have a couple more in a car somewhere.
I guess Adele's in good hands.
How long you talk to her?
It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?
You know they gonna set us up.
They look like plain old rocks.
Come <i>on</i>.
Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
Put it down or I'll shoot.
What do you want to bet?
You can live or die, it's up to you.
Who?
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. He's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system.
You got two minutes, that's all.  Make up your mind.
So you've done this before, huh?
You know how to use one a these?
Nervous?
We still talk, though.
Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.
Is that right?
That part in the movie where they get shot?  Warren Beatty and... I can't think of her name.
Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.
How'd you get this number?
Why not?
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress.
I like your hair.  And that suit.
You did?
You really wear that suit.
I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.
Looks like tonight.
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
I were you, I'd get up and run.
The flight?
Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
Glenn, I know your life history, who your friends are, where you've been and now, it looks like, where you're going.  Put your hands on the wheel.
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
Why's that?
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
Watch the road, boy.  I like this Town Car.  We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass.
Yeah.  If you can step up and actually do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just talking the talk.
Hi, Ray.
Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares.
Flyweight.
Glenn?  No, I don't know any Glenn.
Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
"Hey, yourself."
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, "Undercover"?
Faux goose down.
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
Foley's got it.
White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?
I found a rubber.
...the fuck is this...
What is it with Red?  I've never seen him this way.
Do you have trouble with your boobs in the uniform?
Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.
You know the football player, Red G- Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.
That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
It's Germans!
Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
This ain't a little feud, Earl, it's World War Two!
And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
Danny...
Yeah.
That might not have been such a good idea.  They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield.  The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.
C-Colonel, we been p-practicing takeoff's, but I ain't sure we can land on these carriers d-decks.
I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only.
I heard what you did.
How'd you get this?
How often you fight like this?
Thank you, 'Mam.
You take care, Dorie.
I'm going to the war.  The real war. Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine.  And not just there, but here.
Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
You see us as capable of such a blow?
Quite a bit more rain than usual this year. I hope it doesn't spoil the rhubarb.
It's gonna rain again. Every time I wash the car, it rains.
I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.
Carol!
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
Welcome to the singles' scene.
Peggy Sue!
We're here on the sofa bed...
You got a Tab?
You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...
I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
What are you doing here?
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love —— Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
But what has to be different?
I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
Let me got! Where are you taking me?
You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.
Will you take me back to my grandparents?
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
I beg your pardon?
Fine.  ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
How come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Dolores?
I was impressed with what you said in English class today.
Coffee and a donut.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
Thank God for that.
Yes.
Does everybody have to hear?
Jack, I was just trying to help.
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
Sort of.
Who was that man?
Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
I'm not the maid!
Would they go over my girdle or under?
What are you doing?
Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
Don't eat the red ones.
I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing.
The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a four—eyed worm.
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
Sort of.
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
You're giving me the creeps.
I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
I came to say goodbye.
Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now.
Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.
...the pathologist... he said that you had reported a similar incident... with a cat...
Did she always have reporters following her around like this?
When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys.
Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
What do they do up there?
What happened to you?
What's wrong?!
Geoff, dinner's ready!  Geoff?!
Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie didn't die.
All set?
Not that much appreciation. I thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass.
What's his name?
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
You want me to help?
How can he not have a heartbeat?
Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus?
You ever think about running away?
Mom...
What in God's name... ?
Do you really think so, Andy?
That's the third time. I better call the office.  Would you relax, please?
Thanks for coming in.
Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.
I'm trying to help your "partner." You're not a member of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the ER.
Big trouble.
Find a lawyer?
When you refer to Wheeler, call him Charles, to show how you'd been admitted to the inner circle, you were considered one of them.
I've considered that.
Opera?
Do you have any lesions on <u>any</u> part of your body, at this time, that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired?
Rach.
In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
Objection!
Objection!
We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition. Is that correct?
According to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that?
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
Explain to me, if you can, Mr. Wheeler, explain this to me like I'm a ten year-old. This trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying? <u>Not</u> about your understandable, if unfounded, fear of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it? You're saying, this trial is about Andrew Beckett's character. Am I getting this right?
You have a problem with gays, Joe.
I mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? I don't get it. Don't they get confused? "Is that mine? I thought it was yours." Hey, call me old fashioned, call me conservative... I think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is.
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
Have you changed your aftershave?
Now that you mention it...
Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.
... interview every employee, support staff, associates, partners. Did <u>any</u> of them know Andy was sick? <u>How</u> did they know? Did he tell them? Did they notice something was wrong with his appearance? None of this information got to the managing partners. We know that. Make sure everyone else does too... And Beckett: I want to know everything about his personal life. Did he frequent those pathetic bars on Camac Street?
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
What whispers?
I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
What about her?
As fast as you can.
Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!
Step aboard, Carolyn.
Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.
Christ, you don't know what's out there!
How many bottles?
Hey.
And him?
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
I <u>know</u> what happened -- he went off on the guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and now he's trying to --
I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
Little ratty-ass.
Smoke screen for what?
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
This does not help us, Johns.
Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.
Why did I fall on you?
When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --
So quiet. You get used to the sounds of the ship, then....
Hasan?
They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.
Oh, no. No, no, no....
New Mecca....
"God is Great," yes?
Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
<u>Fuck me</u>. You said "clear."
What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.
To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone.
That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
Do you have to work tonight?
'I am not a missing link.'
Well, maybe they're not.
How did it go?
No.
Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.
That's true, Dr. Zaius. My witnesses -- correction -- my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater.
Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
He's trying to form words.
Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
It's no use ... there she goes.
Gone.
If only we could get a fix.
Not everything. They left a hostage.  How do you feel, Lucius?
They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?
Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
However, it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch you.
If you are protecting others of your kind, it will cost you your identity.
What is your proposal?
Tell him to pull back!
We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me?
Listen-
Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?
Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?
Bob, I gotta bad feeling about this, I... I'm telling you I got a bad feeling, man, I don't think I'm gonna make it... y'know what I mean?
Hey Taylor, you don't know it but I saved your ass today. I killed a shit-eating dog. 
Listen to that shit, that's good shit!
Come on you can do better than that!
Shit boy you been out in the sun too long. You try that, he'll stick it right back up your ass with a candle on it.
First time?
Dawn! That was it!
...I can't sleep, why don't you get some sack time.
Whatcha doing in the underworld Taylor?
I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.
The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.
Right on.
Tennessee someplace. Hill country.
Or Reno?  They always throw them off the bridge there, I've heard.
I'll make one for you.  I live there.
How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.
What's the matter?
Good evening, Miss.
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
Sit down then. We often have a double up here.
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
How did you meet him?
Bad?
He could hardly help suspecting you.
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
Us?
Anything I can do about it?
Well?
See anything?
I thought you had to be back to the hotel.  To leave my--my note.
No.  I paid him off.
It wasn't the time or place.  Don't worry about the note, baby.  I'm playing for my neck now.
Mitchell was dead enough.
You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.
Please answer my question.
That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
Time's up.  I'm off the case. 
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.
What are you going to do--toss your job into Puget Sound?  Because I make you think of magnolias?  I thought policeman was something like a soldier.  That his duty came first.  However much he might happen hate it.
He could have killed me a dozen times.  You'd never have known.
No, Jeff.  You don't.  He's not a murderer, I tell you.  He;s not a murderer.
Mr. Reed, please, for Mr.  Brandon.  Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now.  Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr.  Brandon.
I'm still asking. What do you want?
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly.  How long do we have to wait for this police character?
Could be.
How are you two getting along?
Time for a little chat?
Mitchell was too drunk.
You nasty, sardonic--
I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.
Got a moment, Inspector?
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
... I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector.
That's pretty risky business, Inspector.
I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
No suicide.
You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
I never saw it before.
What about me?
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
Did you ever have a serious operation?
At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?
I don't understand.
Ye have, have ye?
Get out of here!
Shall we go?
Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.
Are you going to have coffee?
James... I can't begin to tell you how pleased we all are.  Congratulations, and I really mean it.
Can I give you a lift?
What did you think of that Wadja film?
Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
You don't trust me.
In radio we're different.
Did she talk about me?
In your car
Blasé and epicene.
To the Fleet.
She's never written a book in it, but she clearly knew a lot.
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
It might have worked.  Really.  I would have been delighted for you if it had.  But she wasn't interested.  Not my fault.
It goes from Henry VIII.  Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II.
It's that lady from Norfolk again.
And Joe Ramage - do you remember him?  He comes and helps out in the shop.
Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.
Something happened.  You got nuked in the last quarter.
Gonna be some people at my house tonight.  Maybe you can make it.
So what's the biggest?  Waimea?
Utah, you copy bruddah?
Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
Look, Harp.  Don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk.  Let me ride him in.
Good move.
Yeah.  What's your theory?
... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.
Did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up?
I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me?
The hell are they?!
Meaning you were expendable.
I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--
No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.
You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!! Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!
Billy's on it.  Heat seeker. Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.
Why us?
He'll be looking for the trip wires. If we're lucky, he won't see this.
Major, you'd better take a look at this.
There's no way you could know that.
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Mind if I turn on some heat?
New York.
What's your name?
For the whole night?
You're joking.
Let's talk some more first.
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
Do you ever... enjoy it?
All right.  How much for the week?
But you want days too.
I think you'll approve.
I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.
Why not?
You still mad at'm?
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
What if I lose it?
What if someone tries to steal it?
If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?
But don't they have it in English?
What else?  You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?
What did you do to him?
Aw, don't... no...
I didn't think so.
I want to.
Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia.  I'll see you in the office.  By the way, about your car...
I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
I don't think there's any sense in --
Edward, we've been together ten years.
We worked for that money.  We were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this street.
He... he just does.
Yeah.
So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco?
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
Yeah, what?
I think you'll find it normal enough.
You'll like it fine.
Barnard Thomas here.  Miss Vivian, I wonder if you might come down to the front desk.  There's someone here to see you.
Yeah, well, I check out today.
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
What?
I bet.  A lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal.
You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
Brides often are, I'm told.
Rest, Highness.
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it.
Can you move at all?
I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.
Oh, Westley, darling.  Westley, why won't you hold me?
We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?
Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.
I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
Faster!
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
Will this do?
Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
Now I think you ought to go to sleep.
As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
For the last time -- SURRENDER!
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
Now?
You know, it's very strange -- I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.
-- yes --
Thank you for everything.
We'll wait until you're ready.
Do you always begin conversations this way?
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
Kill me quickly.
Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.
Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
Wait till I get going! Where was I?
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
You feeling any better?
You mean ooops, don't you?  Say ooops and get out.
All right.  Get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are.
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention.  Am I correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people?
Good, what is it?
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
But that's cheating!
Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
What was I saying?
Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.
What???
Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal.
I got it, Mr. Bialystock.
I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.
How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?
Here.  Buy bullets.  Kill.  Kill them all!
Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
Wait.  No.  How do I know I can trust you?  How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived?
Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.
Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time.
Of Siegfried...
Lorenzo Saint DuBois.  But everybody calls me LSD.
What did you tell the people?
I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
The following morning. Sunday.
What do you mean?
What?
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing.
She's... ill. Confined to her room. It's practically living alone.
Of course not.
There's an old saying, "First customer of the day is always the most trouble!" But like I said, I'm in no mood for it so I'm just going to treat you so fair and square you won't have one human reason to give me...
That's the one I'd've picked for you myself!
Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
Were there any calls?
Is something wrong?
And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
What thing?
What thing could we be in together?
I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'...
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
I feel better when you feel better.
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
Arbogast said...
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
Sorry.
You can't go up there.
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
For what?
I can come down next week.
And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have a lot of laughs. When I send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps.
You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.  And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like.  Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.
Dirty night.
You have something most girls never have.
I've caused you some trouble.
You eat like a bird.
I'm looking for a private island.
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
Except you.
That's it. 
In quite a hurry.
Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off... it'll make the girl feel better, Albert.
Recluse. Kinder word.
Went out before service.
Just coming up to ring for you.
It isn't necessary.
I'll get your bags.
Satisfied with your cabin?
...Forty thousand dollars!
He was out when I was there. If he's back he probably isn't even in bed yet.
Was that all?
No mother.
What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?
You here again?
You can't double-cross me like that.  You were to help me. You were to operate on him. You were going to put him under my power.
There's no child here.
The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.
You lie!
Did you? Where?
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.
What! What are you talking about?
I'm through clowning. You're all washed up. Get out!
He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
You don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore.
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
On the square, Jimmy, if you'd seen Winton down there -- I'm not holding a brief for him -- maybe he's a dirty pup, but he's scared and hysterical -- and so kinda dumb and worthless ...
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
I don't remember. Not so very far--
I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
Nothing. Only she may have tried to blackmail him. You know such things have happened. Anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.
Fine, thanks.
He might get some publicity out of it.
What are you people doing out in the middle of the night?
Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.
Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this.
Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
Two: what if I didn't miss?
I've been dreaming about you.
Could we go somewhere?
Could you?
I've been dreaming about this.
She must have gone out for a walk with the children.
It's so terrible I can't tell you. Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it hurts to have a broken heart, what a terrible feeling it is, and I've had a broken heart so many times. Men, I don't understand them, I can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter how hard I look, all I find is a whole pile of Mr. Wrongs. But this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault. It was my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was bad -- oh God, I was bad, you wouldn't believe how bad I was.
Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?
Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.  Buddy, please don't tell on me.
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
I do, too!
All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room. Where is the girl?
Children, children! Be quiet, all of you!  The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?
Heh, what a hypocrite.
Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.
Rose is almost as sentimental as Mother. If there's one thing I can't stand it's sentimentality. In Chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder. He killed his wife with a black widow spider.
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
He kissed her.
Why is it taking so long?
About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
Got another twenty years in it, boy.  By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.
That's what she would say herself.
But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!
Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?
I am ahead of you.
Well, let's hope for the best, darlin'.
Well, time will tell, won't it?
I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
Her plan is obvious, plain as day. She's going on a hunger strike. The question is, how do we foil her?
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
I thought I knew you. I thought I knew you better, I thought in your heart you were a good and kind man. Well, I can't believe what I've just heard in this room. A defenseless girl depending on you for protection, and you propose to mutilate and destroy her. How could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man?
Rosebaby Blossom, these are the most delicious candied yams I ever ate! Why, they just melt in my mouth. And this fried chicken is fit for a king. How do you do it, Peachbird? What is the secret of your art, Plum Blossom, huh?
Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all.
That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on.
Where do you want me to let you out, Rose?
Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it.
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
And who, Rose, may I ask, is that?
Your baby?
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
I don't mean that the way it sounds.  Imagine it, a book. And I used to know you personal way back when.  Tell me something, Buddy, how do you dream up all that stuff?
I see. Outside it.
Well, no, I didn't actually.
I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.
Daddy, Buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books. Mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it, he took the Lords name in vain, then claimed he hadn't said it. He lied, Daddy.
Afraid of the hospital?
It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically.
Don't worry, Madam, she can't infect your dear little kiddies. She long ago fully recovered, but the disease did irreparable damage. The girl is permanently barren.
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
Rose, this is Waski. His real name is Warren but we call him Waski. He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.
Oh, no, ma'am.
I don't think we ought to discuss this in front of the children.
No more dentists, no more dentists...
Rose, you're very sick. You're burning up. Rose, can you hear me? Rose?
What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
What Eve and I wouldn't give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain.
And... ?
Know what he's doing, Benny?  He's trying to jog your memory.
Last time Billy-Boy did this, the guy's neck broke...  ... just like that.  Sad in a way. Why is it we don't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
Nothing, I guess.  Just an observation.  She's really something special.  You're a lucky fella.
You shouldn't litter.
I say, fuck 'em.  Let's go.
That's sick.
I don't know what the problem is. Plenty of great men throughout history got their bravery out of a bottle
You been wearing rubbers, Billy-Boy?
Birth control's important.
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.
Smooth move, hot-shot.
Where we going?
Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
You fuckers... damn you!  Why?!  Why me!?  Why the obsession with me?
I just think you should show some respect.  I mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom...
Yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  They couldn't go doing everything at once.
Alright?
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
You need a doctor.
What the hell's his problem?
You're... you're not doing what I think you're doing... ?
Oh, yeah... the explosion.
You see that?
This shit was Ming.
Yeah?  So, what do you want to ask today that I can't answer?  I'm a busy man.
I can't do it, Ben.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
What's going on?
The code's changed. We need Artoo!
Yes.
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.
Good luck.
What did he say?
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
What do you remember?
I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
Yoda, I must know.
How many languages do you speak?
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
Janet.
You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
Hello.
Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
No no no no.
I think you had better both come inside.
Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
What's funny?
Some people are very shy by nature.
Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy.
...Guess.
It's all right -- You're my guest.
...What?
'Bout seven.
Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me?
...Can't do it.
I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.
No... I can't!
I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty.
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
I'll carry him 'till the third.
Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!
Now here's what's goin' down. Listen, 'cause I'm gonna say this but one time. On January first, the first day of the Bicentennial I'm gonna fight me a local poor underdog, dig? A snow-white underdog. An' I'm gonna put his face on this poster with me, hear? An' I'll tell you why, 'cause I'm sentimental -- An' all the people in the country all sentimental, man, an' they'd like nothin' better than me, Apollo Creed, to let some unknown get a shot at the greatest title in the world on this country's biggest birthday. Now that's the way I see it an' that's the way I want it!!
Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
This a con?
Cost ya a buck.
We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- Jimmy Michaels.
Yo Rock. Did I give you a job this mornin? How come ya didn't break this guy's thumb like I asked ya? When ya don't do what ya are told, it makes me look bad, kid.
Ya sure?
I feel bad about walkin'.
Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?
Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.
Yo, you gonna show, Tony?
...Screw you.
Rice is a bum.
Hey, ever think about retirin'?
Here's the card?
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.
See how fast he is -- damn!
Can't hardly tell. Don't swallow the blood -- Go for his ribs. Don't let 'im breathe.
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?
...Maybe I better forget it.
Outta my house I want ya!!
How will you fight Apollo Creed?
We don't serve formula. Snookums.
No.  But neither does Roger.  That's Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.
So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.
He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?
These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.
Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe that's what he was after?
Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
Well, everybody needs a hobby.
Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
Hey, don't I get an encore?
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
Keep reading...
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
If she is well then nothing can be ill. Her body rests in Capel's monument, and her immortal part with the angel's lives. I saw her laid low. Pardon me for bringing these ill news.
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow.
Romeo! Romeo!
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
A challenge, on my life.
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.
Uncle, 'tis a shame.
My poverty, but not my will consents.
Are you at leisure Holy Father, now? Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
It strains me past the compass of my wits.
Where is my Lady's lord?
O God. Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? O serpent heart hid with a flowering face. Was ever book containing such vile matter's so fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace.
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
He jests at scars that never felt a wound. But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief, That thou her maid art far more fair than she: Be not her maid, since she is envious; Her vestal livery is but sick and green And none but fools do wear it; oh cast it off. It is my lady, O, it is my love! O, that she knew she were!
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm.
This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less.
A Plague o' both your houses.
And you believed me?  But it wasn't my people who did it.
Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us.
Where's the case?
Go ahead, shoot... Shoot and kill the bitch, I don't care.  And yet you don't shoot.  Interesting. Put down your weapon and walk away.
Do you have it?
I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
And you respect him.
You think you can stitch me up on you own?
It gets done now or not at all.  Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.
The point remains: we could be working for different people.  There's a chance for one of us...  Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others.  I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for.  It can help prevent a great deal of...  ...unpleasantness.
What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?
What're you talking about, man?  I don't understand.
You should watch what you eat.
Sorry I'm late...
Something like that...
What'd you say to him?
So, Vincent: why bring me along for the ride?  Job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening.  A tough guy.
Lovely, isn't it?
What's going on?
That makes twice now you've saved my life.
I'm going with you.
I never made that claim.
How could you have done that?
No you don't, and you know it.
In a minute.
Would you stop with that...
That's a good question.
You son-of-a-bitch...
You put everything on the line because you...
What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix.
Sort of!
What the hell happened here?
Damn.
Shut up!  Not another word out of you!  You're going down, the Feds know all about it!  You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?
Oh, you would have done great.
What are we going to do?
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
We'll torch the bases, how's that?
We'll leave a few packets in the trunk, and stash the rest somewhere else.  Car went up in the gunfight.
I could kill that no good son of a bitch!
And how do you figure we do that?
Well what are we supposed to do?
You don't know if he was really gonna --
What happened?  What's Earl doing here?
It's too late...
I'm all ears.
Yeah I'm fine.
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
Why does that bother you?
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
Yeah, I've seen him.
And what's that?
What is this?  Don't be stupid man...
I guess we can get started.
Well nothing audible to us.  Maybe the lab can pick something up.
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and I’m a busy man.
Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?
Jesse?
I'm at a payphone in Vegas.  What's up?
Why?
Don't you want to hear about my day?
Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much potassium can kill a man.  Just have to...pick a discreet spot.
Hi ma.
Well what do you know!  An air conditioner.
That's great Earl!
This whole place?
Well I don't know --
Thank you honey.  are you sure you don't want it?
Not in the trunk.
The band has been playing over an hour.
James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
What?
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.
I'm busy at the moment.
I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
Would you like me to tell you how your father died?
Oh, you American?
Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.
I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in.
Carter, get off that stage!
Well, hurry up.
What's wrong?
Where are you going?
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along.  Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty.
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
Follow the RichWhiteMan...
You sound like that all the time.
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
Slow down, baby.
She's getting undressed.
I don't understand?
Let me see it again?
You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.
Are you okay?
What about a little king pao chicken?
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
Red Dragon.
That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell.
Lee, what the hell are you doing?
Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She almost got us killed.  She's setting you up again!
You go after Ricky.  I got this.
Your father's badge?  No way, man.  I can't take this.
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.
I always wanted to go to Madison Square Garden.  See the Knicks play.
Behind me is the soft count room.  We're pretty sure the plates are back there.
Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation.
Who the hell is that?
And that, of course, would be me.
He stole my wheel!
What about them?
The license!  You get it?!
I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened.
Alright, listen, no bullshit just tell me straight: did you really know the guy you were chasin'?
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
You like it?
Not yee-aw, Ya'll.  And it's gotta be angry.  Like you're pissed off.
Like that.
No, wait.  I don't have it.  You have it.
Oh no.
I'm talking about the girl.
You understand what I'm sayin'?
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
Where do we find him?
Hello.
I would like one of my people to help.
And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
Yes.
Got any last minute advice?
Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad.
God... Of course.  I'm sorry -- I mean, I'm...  Brian -- I've got to go.  The man's a lunatic, but I know exactly where he's going next.
That's it.  Back to obedience school.
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
Don't say "spec" like it's a dirty word. Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a play!  Plato never got a book advance...
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
Thanks.
And you are?
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
Everest.  Is that right?
You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
Ike... Hi, Grandma.
Kind of isolated.
It's fun!  It's high.
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
What!?
That's called changing your mind.
No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.
I'm sorry, Bob.  She kissed me back.
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
Used?
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
Grandma!
Let's go.
What are you talking about?
You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.
Is that all right with you?
I'll wait.
Happy New Year, darling.
Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
About forever.
What?
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
You were standing in the middle of the street?
This is a photo of hair.
You're going to miss the train.
She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.
Honey, he wasn't right for you.
Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
Howard.
It's probably just the flowers --
The Historical Society wanted this and I never would give it to them --
Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?
Great.  This is great.  The whole town knows.  Just out of curiosity, how do you two know?
Why not?
No.
Is he home right now?
Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
It is not --
Hey, my plate is full.
When's the latest time you were out there?
You'll see.
You'll like it.
Do you want a fruit plate?
Dad, I don't know about this one --
I'm sorry.  I'm just --
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
This is a good letter, Dad.
I have to have a life.  I have to do things that I want with people my own age.  It's none of your business who I am going out with.  I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --
Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom never did that.  Mom never said shut up to me.  Mom never yelled at me.
No.
What if I couldn't get to you?
When I found you?
I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done.  Ready to eat.  Do you know how to make juice?
You're welcome to one.
I mean it. I know your work record. You were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that? You had a real future with this company, but you let those Reds stir you up. And now they'll sell you down the river. Why don't you wake up, Ray?  That's your name, isn't it, Ray?
Jenkins ain't no boss.  Mean we're gonna let people like Jenkins stay here?
Hear you had a little trouble, Quintero. Defective fuse?  Well, you're all in one piece. So what's the beef?
I checked the drift just before he blasted. It was all clear ... The man must have been asleep or something.
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.
It's all set. Consuelo's squad can take they day off tomorrow. We're taking over.
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!
Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!
What's the matter?
Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
How do you feel?
Did you have to sign a pledge? Not to go back to the line?
A meeting?
When?
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
Charley's my friend. I need friends.  Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ...
Why didn't you support her? You're the worst of the lot.
Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
Forgot what?
Boy! Did you see the way Mama whopped that deputy with her shoe? Knocked the gun right out ...
My kids don't have enough to eat!
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. It'll take you right to the highway.
What can I do for you?
Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.
I wanna do a small buy first.  Ten thousand.  We'll see how it goes.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
Is that how you play?
How much time do you have?
What are you hiding, Danny?
Who is it?
I need my paycheck.
Really, I don't want to.
What is it?
Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?
Nice dealer you got there, Jimmy.
I'm hurting.
That's a good one.
I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
Not bad.
I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
Shoot him.
Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?
You don't find that repugnant?
I was getting to it.
What the hell are you doing here?
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
What? Is it bad?
He knows somebody ratted him.
Jimmy?
What's that smell?
Excuse me?
A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.
Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.
Good luck, John.
I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.
That must be four thousand yards.
Last I knew.
So, that's Ryan.
Yes, sir.
Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle, I never would 'a volunteered for this here mission.
Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
Upham?
I wasn't made for this.
It seemed appropriate.
Some.
No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.
Beasley's dead.
A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut divisions, no fronts, no lines, the drops were completely fouled up, we've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place, trying to hang on.  Command says we hold St. Mere, but north of that, it's all Krauts.  Even if Ryan's where he's supposed to be, he's more than likely dead.
You think they'll be alright?
They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.
If we stayed, we could make a difference.
I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.
A couple of weeks.  It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for loading.
Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder.
She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
What do you think?
I don't think so, Captain.
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain.
Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?
Huh?
Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.
Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.
No, sir.
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE COME.  Cover me.
What deal?
I wonder if his cabin is still available?
Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.
Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.
Frogs?
So, where are you from?
How do you do it?
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
Hi.
I'll take the whole set.
It's no problem.  I called Mom and Dad in Germany; it's like they were there.
Did you sleep with her?
Alright, alright, alright, calm down, alright, calm down. Nothing's different.
No, you're not a guy.
"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd."  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
I can't give you that.  This guy's been ripping off grandma and grandpa for seventeen years.  He's been getting it from every end.  I'd love to hear his story.
Lloyd, she's being difficult.
Visit her at the home.
You like it?
God, that's... this is ridiculous.
They really applauded you today honey.
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
Tell me, is it bad news?
Don't do this to me. You're too good at making me nervous.
She's not the world's greatest flyer, let me tell you.  When she was eight years old, she...
You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
Honey!
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
Yeah.  I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.
Eight. Eight O' clock.
Yeah.
I think you should wear that.
After work?
Okay, bye.
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
Yeah.  Now, when you feel like you're confident,...
Are you comfortable?
Check your mail tomorrow.  I sent you a letter, a letter.
It did?
How do you know what I'm going to say?
Okay, what did we just decide?
Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?
You shared it with a dick.
You told your dad?
What is that?  What are you doing with your hands?  Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila.
How's it going?
Jim Court?
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir.  Are you alright sir?  Are you okay?
You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
I love you man.
We're full on bonded.
Luck.
We started without you.
It's bad business.
Oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense.
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
What's wrong with it?
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
Don't ever do that to me again.
I got to go, I'll see you.
You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time?  I know.
No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
I'll talk to him.
Well, that's to be expected.  They have to understand.  These are start-up problems. This isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business.  I'll write them a letter.
I'll talk to you later.
What's he done that's so bad - take money? That's a crime?  Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war?  We're here to make money, all of us.
We know that, son.
Have you checked the...
Shit.
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else.
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
"Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?
Cotton.
It’s perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. I’m the victim.
Now, Gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. You're not having character doubts now, are you?
Lemme take you home.
She's got guards with her.
You’re the one who got away.
And now, drum roll please...
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
Hello, Dwight.
You have every right to be upset.
I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say except I'm sorry.
And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
They're roomates.
Ssshh! What was that?
Let's go.
Dewey?
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay.
Sidney. Hello. How are you?
I'm sorry.
Sid, I'll come with you.
Yes, goddammit!
Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take her late evening.
Can I come with her?
The young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again.
She's not here right now.
Well what number are you trying to reach?
You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben Damon.
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
What?! But I did everything you said to do!
I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
Who?
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
Oh yeah, how?
Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.
What are you doing here? I told you to stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here.
Where are you Dewey?
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
Jennifer needs me.
Thank you.
Has anyone else every used your phone?
I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.
You! How can I ever get any fame playing you!
Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
Excuse me Detective, I think we have some business to attend to.
WHERE?
Alright, I'm here. Now what?
Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can finish this.
Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
She can't get both of us.
My dad's in the other room.
No...
Why did you kill my mother?
I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother.
Who is this?
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
Why? You wanna ask me out?
I have to go now.
Listen, asshole...
I'm two seconds from calling the police.
I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone.
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
What kind of game?
Now for the real question.
But you're doing so well.
And why is that? Has something happened?
Evening, ma'am.
Any word on my Dad?
Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls.
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
Have they found my father?
She's okay. Looks like some boys were teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the school though. I want you to take look around.
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
That fish smelled strong.
What? What?
Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.
The control board's glitched. You know we can't carry a live picture.
Off the record. No cameras.
Why would Sidney want to be with Steve? She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy.
Cut some slack. She watched her mom get butchered.
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
Can you see me right now?
Are you okay?
Stu was with me last night.
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?
Stop. Right there.
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
So what's his reason?
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?
Is Billy going to be there tonight?
What do you think about when you're having sex?
How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
No way.
There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.
Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened?
With that set of lungs -- she should be.
How is it working for a scumbag like this? You proud of yourself?
It's none of my business anymore.
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
And... and... and he said... he asked me if I was married.  And, I could see he had a gun in his hand.
What's so exciting?
It's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct.
Give me the gun.
Where we headed?
We're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, Johnny?  That wouldn't be... shocking enough.  Wouldn't keep you on the front page of the newspapers.
You just met me.
Not here.
Who said this was murder?
It's a package deal.  You get the phone with the office.
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.
He must have left another puzzle piece.
Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
What?
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!
He just may be nuts enough.
Oh, blah, blah, blah.  The guy's insane.
This quote... his first words to us.  I looked it up.  It's from Milton's Paradise Lost.  "Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light... "
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
Well, that was money well spent.
Are you alright?
We could use about fifty more men here.
You know... there's not going to be a happy ending to this.  It's not possible anymore.
You think you're doing me a big favor by staying?
Throw your gun down now!
It's nice to meet you.  My husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.
I was close once.  It just didn't happen.
I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
Why always like this?  Only after the fact... this sudden realization, that if you shoot someone, or stick a knife in them, that person will cease to exist.
Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
Did their son see it happen?
Lucy's going on seventeen now...
Let's get along...
You all right, sergeant?
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day- break.
What do you know about it?...What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?
Martin! Ride me as far as the well!
Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?
Steady, Daniel Boone! You don't want to miss...It makes them think their medicine's stronger than yours...
Told ya, didn't I?
Scar! Where's he holed in?
That's what I said.
Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan...
All right...but I'm givin' the orders...You take 'em or we split up here and now...
And you think we got a chance to find her?
He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...
Futterman?
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...
You ask her!
Ethan, quit it!
Suit yourself...While you're enjoyin' your little conversation, I'll be ridin' out with Senor Fernandez here... The Comanch' medicine country ain't far...there's one camp with a chief named Cicatriz.
How? She's even forgot her own language!
Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.
Why it's just a snip of calico...
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...
I have to cut his windpipe...
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
Is everything alright?  Aren't you feeling well?
Cherry-red Tears.
Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
Where have you been?
Will you finally cut it out?  Just in case you haven't noticed, I am trying to write a book here.  And maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it's a pretty tough job. So why can't you just leave me alone?
Listen, it's one thing to have a guilt complex. But I know the difference between when I'm overstrung and when I'm seeing things that are simply not there! Besides, it only began after we moved!
And that is?
I think it's starting again. You know... there was something peculiar.  If only I knew...
Hey, my man!  How's the masterpiece coming along?
Will…Where is Mercutio?
You did not like the speech?
Oh
Ah
What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
Never!
Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket.
And your relations?
I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.
Where is the play?
Is it going well?
Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.
Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!
No Juliet?!
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
Nobody. The author.
The show must … you know
Good luck with yours, Kit.
"Good morrow, cousin."
Two hours at prayer!
As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.
"I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee--"
Will!
But your voice  Have they dropped?
"O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
As any mule in Christendom. But if you are the man to rider her, their are rubies in the saddlebag.
I like it when they cut heads off. And the daughter mutilated with knives.
I am.
I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play.
I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
My lady VIOLA.
How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.
She loves me, Thomas!
Your aunt?
Oh!--it's--it's--oh, it's a house of ill- repute!
Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin.  My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!
All right, just a few questions.
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
I'm only asking what you think.
Only on expenses.
He's still here.
When are you going to let the police know?
You know what. Who's going to do it.
That was good.
Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do --
How much did you pay?
How much?
What? Yes, that's fine.
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
But they know.
What?
Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.
I don't know them.
What? Uh, no, no, it's a fake. I picked it up in Thailand. The second hand doesn't sweep, you see.
Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
Cameron.
And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are the sunshine of my life'?
Did you know --
Know and love?
What sort of car?
No.
Be careful.
David, I promise we will. Keep him happy.
Well, you certainly had a good look around.
Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
We could put it somewhere.
You'll wait in the hall?
Are you all right?
Of course, but I think you'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed --
You mustn't take it so badly.
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
No, I've never seen them.
That's what it cost, David.
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
We already know. All about it.
Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
What's it about?
No.
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
For what?
No. I haven't seen them.
I thought you were in a good mood.
Lester.
You're late, George.
Nummers.
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.
I can see that.
That headboard.
Shit.
Did you hear me?
Yeah, it is.
I am not!
Jesus, look at this. Nine, nine and three quarters -- that's our prime rate. And I'll tell you something else: the big boys are going for it.
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
Jesus...
Well, what do you think?
You don't seem very sure.
Okay... but I want you to know one thing.  I've got to look great tonight, I mean I have to look great, okay?
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.
Did you?
Baby...
No! Don't! Please!
-- where'd you go?
-- very nice, very nice.
-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
Yeah?...
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...
-- you shouldn't do me like that...
-- took a bus.
Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas.
I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream.
Will we live together?
But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!
What business meeting?
-- well aren't you --
So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?
What? What? What? What? What?
It's an unusual trade.
No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?
When?
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
Why, why do you think that is?
... You can lose it all; you can lose it all no matter who you are... I don't know, what's the point of having it all. Look at me. I don't have a goddam thing... the market's terrible right now, went down ten points last week, goddam Lyndon Johnson!
Oh, by the way, I think you oughta know -- Lorna thinks she's got the clap.
What took you so long?
All right, who're you with? Jill?
Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.
I'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, I can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. You're driving me up the wall, Lester. You're even jealous of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have somebody I can talk to.
Here.
No.
Does she know about us?
I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.
I am? I mean why?
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?
It must be something.
I thought you said things were great with George.
We don't think marriage is important.
I would say so, yes.
Oh. thank you.
Sort of.
I'm terribly sorry.
What does he do? Is he an actor?
Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?
-- listen, I wonder if you kids could give me a ride? I'm kind of stranded here.
Everything okay, son?
Are you sure?
I love you, Danny.  I love you more than anything else in the whole world, and I'd never do anything to hurt you, never... You know that, don't you, huh?
It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything.
Yeah.
We're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then I'll come back and check on you, okay?
We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?
Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?
Danny?
Red Rum.
Red Rum.
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
To my stomach.
Please...
But eh what was the matter with him?
Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?
What sort of injury did he have?
Delbert Grady.
Yes, sir.  I have a wife and eh two daughters, sir.
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady. I'll deal with that situation as soon as I get out of here.
Good evening.  Forest Service.
I'd be glad to do that, sir.  Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?
Dick, can we borrow Mrs. Torrance for a few minutes?  We're on our way through to the basement - I promise we won't keep her very long.
Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the prettiest.
Beg pardon?
Hi Lloyd.  I've been away.  Now I'm back.
Hi, babe.
Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.
and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand?
And you didn't see anything at all?
Somebody did that to him.
You mean just leave the hotel?
Jack!
As soon as possible.
Stay away from me!
Very nice to meet you.
Let's see, where were we?  Yes.  I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May.
Right there.
Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!
Lowe's car-?
What's the money for?
Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
Jane... you don't have to do that.
Not bad, huh? My Uncle Al took off the regular muffler and put on a Cherry Bomb.
I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but...
You all right, Marty?
Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
No one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.
What if I say no?
I come here because Marty needs a friend.
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
You are so damn sexy.
She's afraid.  Come on, tell the boys you're afraid.
Oh my! 
Where did that come from?
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.
Is this... choir practice?
Hold on.
What is it, Mary?
Jackpot!  Two buckets
Like this place?
Sure.  Kind of... free-lance.
Babies
We must... get you some experience.  We must... leave this place.
Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last night...
I don't want to mess anyone up...
Run!  Take off!
Fine.  Got it.  Look, the way I see it, I'm stuck here, right?  I mean, I'm here or I'm target practice.  So here's the deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug me.  I'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low.  So just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb.  Capisce?
Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?
A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
A balloon and a banana!  Tell me, Mary Clarence, what were you thinking?
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
He's a businessman.
Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out for you.  You have to hide like you don't even exist.  You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
I really can't talk about it now.  The place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show to do.
I am?
Well..  thanks.  I've been thinking about you.. - sometimes.  I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here.  I mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun.
I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
Where's who?
Joey?
It should be here any minute.
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
We've got to save her!
Sister Mary Patrick?
Ice cream!
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
She's a nun, Vince.
And who are you to talk?  You were nothing.  You couldn't even sing.  I must have been out of my mind.
Where?
Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?
They spend two days in chains.
I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
Why did you move the body, Doctor?
... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed.
Wallowing in sin and lust...
Taken.  Taken by the Headless Horseman.  Taken back to hell.
Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.
The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
Are you familiar with magnets?
It's spectacular.
No, I couldn't...
We are leaving.
What is it?
She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir? 
Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?
I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.
He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
What are you on about?
What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
Allow me some time.  I have spent every hour in the company of others. I need to be alone.
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
What... what are you doing... ?
What is so urgent?
When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself.
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
What was that?
You said yourself.  What mere man could have downed the Belltower?
I know you saw me.
Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?
What... what are you doing?
You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.
All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow.
Thank ye.
Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to see you. Been a long time.
Don't look much like he could. You say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness.
How 'bout you, Jerry.
Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. Ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything.  But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him.
Did you decide, sir?
About a half a mile I think it is.
I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin' that big-ass bass.
Yeah.
You know what we ought to do tonight?
Okay ladies and gentlemen  or both. It's come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band. Over here on lead guitar Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on hit a hot lick, Randy.  Well, come on, y'all are supposed to clap now. Come on! 
He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
Leave.
Leave.
Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home.
You like that Vaughan?
I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow.
You believe in the Bible?
Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.
Can you go there with us now? Me and Karl. We could just hang out. Karl has some cool books.
Yeah. What you doin' by here?
Wait a minute. You want to go with me? You can meet my mama.
Maybe they needed it.
Well, I hate him.
Will you stay here with us for a long time?
I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
I didn't mean to say anything bad about you. I know you're good. You didn't mean no harm.  Did you ever think about killin' yourself on purpose like my daddy did?
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
What you readin'?
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to looking at pretty people.
I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.
I'll be.
Two fellers was on a bridge a takin' a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water. One of 'em came from Arkansas, I believe.
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
Yes sir.
Karl, what are you doing here? Come in.
He just got out of the state hospital.
What about me?
I didn't mean that.
And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go--
And the bookstore? Have you been working there long?
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
Jesus, what happened to you?
What happened?
And what about for you?
What about for you?
Hey, Auggie. How's it going?
It's yours?
I didn't know you took pictures.
I'd like to see your pictures some day.
I've never seen anything like it.
Slow down, huh?
Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from that year. She must have been on her way to work.
So, what brings you to a dive like this?
I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but she hasn't heard from him either. It's beginning to get a little scary.
So what did he say when he called?
Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?
Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?
No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?
That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
She looks just like you.
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.
For keeps?
There's just one thing I want to know.
Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.
Lovely.
No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
A little. Not much.
... If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. Do you understand what I'm saying? You never know what's going to happen next, and the moment you think you know, that's the moment you don't know a goddamn thing. That's what we call a paradox. Are you following me?
Forty-four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.
Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?
Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
I'm afraid we'll be working on a strictly freelance basis.
Yeah, but he's my son. Nothing strange about that. He's my own flesh and blood. But here you got the same name as this man here, and you're not even the same color.
I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.
Be nice, sweetie. We're just here to help you.
Okay, joke about it. I don't give a shit.
You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
That's where the what comes in.
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?
A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
Close the door.  Sit down in that chair.  Now listen carefully. Your Aunt Em came here a couple of days ago. She was sick with worry, out of her mind. We had an interesting talk about you, Thomas. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your aunt thinks you're in trouble and so do I. Tell me about it, kid. I want to hear all about it right now.
And?
I just happened to be walking by... All of a sudden, the Creeper and this other guy come running out of this check-cashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands... They just about ran smack into me. The Creeper recognized me, and I knew he knew I recognized him... If the guy from the check-cashing place hadn't rushed out then screaming bloody murder, he would have shot me. I'm telling you, the Creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk. But the noise distracted him, and when he turned around to see what was happening, I took off... One more second, and I would have been dead.
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him.
So you're saying it wasn't like that at all.
Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all.  It was <u>human</u>, yes?  Type B positive.
But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.
Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first.
When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
Just three questions.  The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
It is.
Now, Mister Gi...
Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
I said 'excited'.  Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.
Yes, and then, what was there to call about?  Everything was up in the air.
It's just Pearl Harbor.  People are a little crazy, right n...
I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t...
You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael.  Not once, not ever.  There's no half- way.  As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go.
They're not his neighbor, like you are.  He is a husband, a father, he risked his <u>life</u> for <u>their</u> country. The same as you.
It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side.  And it's brand new.  Unlike the rest.
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
But Carl was a fisherman.  And successful at it.
You have the night watch?  On the radio.
And you keep the records, or contribute to 'em.
How long you have this detail?
I did.  Boy.
You said three minutes.
Now you believe there were <u>two</u> lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand.  The second lashed to the mast.
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
You wouldn't even see it move.
Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it <u>possible</u>.  Possible that he struck his head <u>after</u> death. Possible?
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
What else could it be?
That's <u>why</u> the autopsy report identifies <u>drowning</u> as the cause of death.
For certain, no.
The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
Wanna see my driver's license?
Which of you dolls is Daphne?
Hi, Mary Lou - Rosella - Okay, Dolores, get a move on - How's your back, Olga?
Say, boss - I been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that Little Bonaparte is real sore about what happened to Toothpick Charlie.  Him and Charlie, they used to be choir boys together.
Same faces - same instruments -  - and here's your Valentine's card.
Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out - Moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail -
Greased Lightning!  Why do I listen to you? I ought to have my head examined!
You mean it's a girls' band?
You've flipped your wig!
It's a hundred miles, Joe - it's snowing - how are we going to get there?
Where are we running, Joe?
Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.
Not there - that's the emergency brake.
I changed it.  It used to be Sugar Kowalczyk.
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
Good night, Daphne.
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
Jerry!  You can't be serious!
I'll say there is!
You're out of your mind!  How can you get away with this?
Joe, if we get out of this hotel alive, you know what we're going to do? We're going to sell the bracelet, and grab a boat to South America and hide out in one of those banana republics -  The way I figure is, if we eat nothing but bananas, we can live there for fifty years - maybe a hundred years - that is, if we get out of the hotel alive.  Did we forget anything?
Sugar?
Hello, my dearest darling.  So good to hear your voice again.
I don't know about the captain - but the navigator is getting his tail out of here.
And your head is hot.
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
Who needs vermouth?
And bring the cocktail shaker.
Here you are, Sugar.
See?  She doesn't have one either -  You don't?
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
His yacht?
I'm a what?
Yeah - Josephine.
Did he get fresh?
Brand new.
How did those holes get there?
It's about the Florida job.
We could dye our hair.
Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
Daphne...
Don't I know you two from somewhere?
And you'll be in all evening?
Tell what?
Me?
Yeah.
Brains aren't everything.
I want mine to wear glasses.
What's happened?
Want to switch berths with me?
What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.
You're not hurt, are you?
Are you staying at the hotel?
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?
You collect shells?
Would you mind moving along, please?
I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?
I just got this motorboat - it's an experimental model.
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
You mean - like frigid?
I don't want to bore you.
My family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in Boston - imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money!
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
Anything this time?
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
Gee, I wish I'd been there.
Really?
Oh - that kind of a merger.  Is she young? Pretty?
What'll it be, sir?
You're wasting the taxpayers' money.
Where did they play it - in a garage on Clark Street?
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
Hi, Spats.  We was laying eight to one you wouldn't show.
We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend.  I was fourteen.
It was such a long time ago.
She blames Tony Pee-Pants Pinterello for everything. The fall of the British Empire, the Cold War, the internet.
What’s going on with you two?
Ah, a philosopher.
Crikey.
Why, Jeffrey. Hello.
You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?
Right. Seven.  Christ, that’s a long time, isn’t it?
You’re not even listening.
What color are my shoes?
Mmm.
What is?
Sorry. I’m a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.
So...what was I...oh, yeah. Do you honestly think that I want to be single and miserable? That I want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart.
Yes.
Come on.
So you’re telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? That’s a down payment on a Ford Focus!
Fourteen and he’s hoodwinked by a an erector set?
Nice speech. I thought it was “touching”... and “funny.”
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You haven’t visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
Like fifteen.
Yeah.
I’m worried. Amy’s not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  Is it ‘drunker’ or ‘drunker-er’?
You got a pretty house, Miss Johnson!
You're a friendly lady, Miss Johnson.
I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me...  You wanna hear another story?!
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
:...THE CHANCE TO SOAR IN THE DIM BLUE AIR ABOVE SMOKE IS TO THEIR...
I see you found what you was lookin' for.
Mama is outside with Josie Mae and Earl.
Into the clouds and behind the mountains.
Mornin', son...
You just came back home, Daddy. I don't wanna leave right now -- I wanna stay home and be with you.
Miss Boatwright --
See you tomorrow, Miss Boatwright.
Did you see Daddy?
What's that you carryin'?
Who's Miss Johnson?
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
Come, I'll take you home.
I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
Well, let me have it.
Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!
You ready to eat?
What did he want?
What...
Come on, you guys... We have to THINK!
-no Cheesy Poofs.
Oh, son of a bitch!  AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit!
How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking?
You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.
CARTMAN!
Mph rmph rm!!
Mrphmmmph!!!
Mom...
Mkay.
What was that word, young man!?
Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?
What's going on, Chef?
Chef, what does it mean that we're at war?
May I?
Mph rmph rm!
SHIT!
Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?
I thought you had something planned.
Oh, brother.
Thank you, Kenny.
Oh Lord, what have we done...?
Shiteater-
I'm needing lunch.
You're all part of Satan's army now!
What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?
Uh, we're just, starting our program...
How is the children's progress?
Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I just got a letter!
Say Phillip, want to see the Northern Lights?
Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!!
Phillip, this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when I fell asleep in that disco.
AGH!
Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!
You know I do.
What did you do today Satan?
Well I just want you to be impressed with what I <u>do</u>. I want you to respect my MIND.
I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!
No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't just renege on a deal. That's lying.
Yeah!
What the hell are you talking about, kid?
Wendy?
Check.
I think we're moving.
I never though I'd be stuck in a wine closet with Warren Wayne.
Excuse me?
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
Weren't you down in the dining room?
Yes he did.  Yes he did. Barnes looks at the monitor - Taylor and the others are still in the dining room -
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
Why should she, it's her fault. All guests are told not to eat in zero gravity, but she just wanted to have fun I guess, didn't realize what a grain of salt can do to sophisticated machinery.
What, and leave you here all by your lonesome?
Now do you want the good news first or the bad news?
Will do.  What about the distress signal?
This ship is going down in a blaze of glory!
Is that clear?
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
We're going to die.
Oh right, right you're on that research grant.
Supposing we could get out of this room?  Is there anything we could do to reach the bridge?
Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
Damn it.  If only we could get to those suits... Dawn then thinks of something -
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.
Oh my God.  What happened?
I'm in the bridge.
Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!
Sooner than later.
In that case, I accept.
I'm going back for Taylor!
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
It's getting too cold in here.  I can't stand this anymore!
I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?
What the hell is that?
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?
Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor -
Ok Mac...  I'll talk to you on this. I want to find a way to get to the bridge, then I want you to come back.
You have orange whips?
Sorry about your loss.
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.
I hate fuckin' opera.
The Faz sure took care a her.  Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to suppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him. Sid and Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid.
This scam we got going here was your 
Need some advice, huh.
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.
That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.
Did that porcupine say he'd get you back on the tour?
It could just as easily have been me in that box.
Don't tell me, John.
Uh...over easy.
It depends.
Who's there!
Come on, Junior. Everyone's waiting for you, son. The beam of light catches Junior's face. He is crouched inside the machine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy.
We're having a party for you, boy. Cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love. Junior cringes away from the light.
Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
After we eat, Dad.
You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
Get that outta your mouth!
Here Theo, it's the Fazeli specialty; a seven-ten split. Theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing.
Mind if I cut in?
Do you have a girlfriend?
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?
Do you talk with your mom?
How much would you charge me for the lips?
Come on, bargain with me.
What are you going to do about your brother?
Nothing.
What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?
Can I come with you?
You don't get two chances with Junior.
Say something, Theo. Give me something. A doll's legs catch fire. Theo stares into Sheila's eyes.
Back to plan A. The vicious cycle all over again. Theo lets go of Sheila.
Sez you!
Lips still for sale?
You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health.
Fletcher, get away from there...
In basic English, what does all this mean?
Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.
Where is it?
What was that?
What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.
Maybe older --
Don't get hysterical, Norman.
Harry's missing.
I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She can be drastic.
A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university.  She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments.  She was also living with him.  Yeah, I know.  And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.
Great, okay.  Ask him about his weapons.
Edmunds?
Damn it, Edmunds?
What for?
Yes, sir.  I'm here.
What caused it?
Get him out of there.  I thought I told you people --
Yes, sir.
Norman, get out of there now! Norman?
Right.  So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows.  The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman.
Some sort of lead or something.
We had considered it.
But what does it do?  This... sphere.
Did you hear me, sir, because --
It won't register.  It's too big to image.
Where'd this come from?
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
I can't feel her bones.  She's like a sponge.
Norman.
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
You said something to him, didn't you?
Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
What's Harry doing with your suit in there?
No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
I don't know.
I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
Ulcers.
I'm sorry.
You manifested that, Beth.
Yes.
That's bullshit.
Shut up, Beth --
It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.
Beth, stop it!
You can't stop it, Norman.  You can't fight me.
Top shelf, is it?
It's empty.  Why would someone build a ship like this?
Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?
What?
When did it come across?
You holding up alright?
You sound defensive.
C'mon, Norman.
Nice work, Norman.
I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.
What is that?  That noise?
Harry, can you tell me about the sphere?
Norman?
I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.
Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
We just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to... work together through this.
What is it?
It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you?
Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...
An American spacecraft?  Half a mile long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah, good theory, Harry.
Well, if it's a discharge --
He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things.
Well, he's polite.
There's a U.S.  Navy car outside, Norman.
I'm Han Solo, Captain of this vessel.  Who's in charge then?
No, not anymore.
We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.
That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything.
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.
You were right.  It is my responsibility.  The Force of Others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me.
That is not a human decision, not your or mine.
Are you sure you don't need it?
Of course, where you been kid?
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.
I found it... It's just not there.
Watch it!  Move back.
I am Luke Starkiller at your service.
You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
Thank you, sir.  Your kindness is greatly appreciated, but if it's at all possible, Artoo and I would like to remain in your service.
You rich kids... are all the same !
We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know.
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.
So what are you doing later ?
Hey ! What are you doing here ?
WHERE IS IT ?
Johnny, wait...
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
Carmen...?
Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...
...I'm sorry.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !
You still gonna play for Brazil ?
Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
What's that, Diz ?
Good good, then it's all settled.
Oh, my, what's that ?
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?
We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?
I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.
I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.
The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am !
Well, yeah, sure...
Let's go.
Don't be a hero...
What is your position ?
Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want some now ?
Rico, you're acting Sergeant now. My last Sergeant lost the com pack. Put together a search team and find the radio shack. We need retrieval.
Hit your jets, sir !
This is my farm. Get on the boat, NOW ! That's an order, Sergeant.
Who is...'V'ger'...?
The examination is a normal function.
What does that mean?
To join, and become One with the Creator?
As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.
Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!
Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?
If our Executive Officer has no objections...?
Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that...
Reporting as ordered, Captain.
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
Recommend we proceede, Captain.
Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...
Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
Evening, Annie.
You bringing your new friend?
So young, so unlined, so full of promise.  So innocent.
Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.  I think that I got fired.  I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
Well.  It was a pleasure meeting you.
I don't mean to impose, but...do you think we might...
...who...?
How can you <u>say</u> that?
I <u>can</u>?
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
"Rise, one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice."
Fix my glasses.
Later on.
But it's absurd.
Why?
What've you got?
Yessuh.  Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years.
Yeah, you?
We could live up here, live up in the country.
To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.
But it'll stop the movie.
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?
I know em, I don't know what order they come in...
Town ain't got no courthouse.
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?
They're holding it for ransom.
How big is this horse?
That's right.
Bobby, don't say anything.
I saw Desert Sun, I wanna tell you...
How old are you?
You look at:  girl comes in the room, an <u>apron</u>, a brown <u>bag</u>, what is she...? She's a...
She's a <u>waitress</u>.
Alright.  Let's...  Page five, the fucking <u>horse</u> dies.  You know, <u>she</u> could be in the movie, she could, she's got a good face, she could be the Doctor's...uh, why does it have to be his, uh, <u>wife</u>...?  It could be his...
Are you Okay?
Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, <u>but</u>...
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
What's his name?
Nobody.
It's a mistake.  It's all over.  I'm sorry that we've inconvenienced you.
Get him on the phone.
Matzoh!  Are you Jewish?
Look.
Will you help me out...?
Hi.  I hope I'm not disturbing...
...we had a script conference...
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
I know that, Claire.  I, we <u>all</u> know...
...I know...I know...
An artist of your caliber...
...yes...
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't <u>tell</u> you...
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
What?
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
Moral turp...you're on my home court, friend, I have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I got rape, I got collusion...
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
We can't shoot in the Old Mill.
That, that's <u>your</u> life's blood on the st...
I'm trying, honey...I'm...look, is your Ma, when is your <u>Mom</u> coming?  Oh.  What did the <u>midwife</u>...?
We're out of money.
Hey, Joe...Good.  You know B...
I want to make a good film.
What's the...
Know?  They could draw them from memory. You're fantastic.  What a find you are. Get outta here.  We need the Dead Horse Scene.
I don't getcha.
<u>Siddown</u>!
You didn't see it...
My oh my.
What's in all the bags?
I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
I CAN'T PUT A COMPUTER IN A MOVIE SHOT IN 1895...you wanna tell me how I'm gonna' do that?
I have to tell you, I can not <u>express</u> to you how <u>happy</u>...
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
Well, you know, Walt, I just wanted to say that anything I could do...
...not at all...
On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.
Why?
Ben!  What's wrong?
I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
Like who?
Well, not exactly s...
Scream.
Look she's upset --
I hope it's the right kind.
She is only the <u>Princess</u> of Cool. <u>Mommy</u> is the Queen!
What's Thursd...
I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...
The timing was off -- I need this light.
She still packing for her trip?
You think this is funny?
I <u>did</u> what she said.  I <u>used</u> my words, I <u>told</u> him what I <u>felt</u>, and they...
I hate her.  I really hate her.
You touched it.
No.
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.
Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
I'm fine, ba...
Ben.  God doesn't like visitors.
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
Called him.  We set an ap...
You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> well-being.
Still, please.
It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there.
How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.
Yeh?
She already hates me.  You've seen to that.
So why did y...
What about obsessively picking her split ends?
You feeling all right?
I don't know wh...
Bi-coastal parenting.  Happens every day.  Luke gets the kids every other summer, every other holiday, it's not ideal, but people make it work, and...
Did I hear the word...
Small world.
I really look like shit.
Can I say one thing?  I mean, the <u>last</u> thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b...
It's the same choice you made.
I know you, huh?  The car pools, he measles, the PTA.  It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  You have to think long term.
Actually.  They'll want Annabelle's mother.
You put filth in my child's mouth.
You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
Thanks for coming out.
What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
I never wanted to be a mom.  Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life...
Ben never mentioned it.
Why didn't I?
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
The way you cook.  If you could make love, I'd marry you.
Uh-oh.  I mention marriage, all of a sudden...  Ve <u>haff</u> to ta...
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
You don't trust me to be alone with them.
She called it a fight.  <u>The</u> fight.
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.
Nice to have you here.
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.
Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY  Good.
Marty...
We used pull.
What are you going to do?
Hey, you want to hear my short story now?
I can read it to you.
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
But what kind of pull did you have?
I think Scooby's like a lot of kids. He just hit a…a speed bump. Now he's gonna find his way, his path is gonna be cleared, and I think he's gonna continue his education at a good college. And everybody else is gonna be happy.
What DO you know?
You're welcome.  Dad?…Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
Hey, Mikey!
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
You have beautiful skin.
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
...gger.
Nigger.
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
That's too bad.
Huh. Kids?
Prnceton.
Hey, um, Toby? I was wondering…Is the documentary almost finished?
Can I see what you have so far?
Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?
Let's move it we got company!
He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
What do you mean?
Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
Are the labs in operation?
I suppose...you think I should thank you.
Good.
What about Cooper--where is he?
This was taken when Richter was arrested in Washington state, 1985. He was charged with interstate arms trafficking, skipped bail, and has since been a fugitive.
And--of course there is the human cost, which is incalculable.
Who's Ryan Cooper?
And what exactly do they intend to do?
Something tells me you don't want to be on TV, friend.
If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
Yes?
Damn you, de Sade!  You know as well as I do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual, whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country.
That's nonsense, and you know it!
And now, Mister President, I must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the Premier.
What are you talking about, Major?
What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator...  Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine.  There's bound to be enough change in there.
Well, that's ridiculous.  If the teleprinter and radio links are out of order, just pick up a phone and pay for a call.
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.
Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.
Are you trying to be insubordinate?
Now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.
Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?
I don't think so, sir.
But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
Well, I know they've been going on for years, and they haven't gotten any place.
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
I still ask, why do they want disarmament?
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
Do you think we'd cheat?
General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing.
Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
But he'll hear everything we're saying.  And if he just looks out of that window, he'll see everything we're doing. 
We don't operate like you KGB boys.
I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.
He says they've only shot down three planes.
How do you know they were shot down, Buck?
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
War.
A through H is correct.
Check.
Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.
They must have made a visual contact.
Could you take her up right now, King?  Other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.
Primary arming switch.
What does it look like?
Master safety.
First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.
Are you sure?
Maybe the warning system's out.
There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?
I think it's okay, King.  They should go off on impact.
We're on course, Major.  Just fixed our position on that river back there.
We are?
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
Uh-huh.
Want a beer?  Is Pony coming?
It's really not about anything.
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
Your a nurse?
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
No, I'm here. Where are you?
Pony's coming here to the corner?!
Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff, Buff.
I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin.
So, do you guys want to do something, go someplace or something like that?
Good.
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
Y- s-sure it did.
Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain.
It's safe, come on.
I don't care. I'm gonna drop it. I'm gonna drop it. I'm...
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.
You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk.
A Porsche.
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
"It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
It's okay. This kind of thing happens. It's just never happened to me. I'm sorry. It's true though. Mm. So, um, what's your TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
Two-fifty.
Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.
I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?
What? What'd you do?
They let you out?
They never hurt me? They hurt me every day with their attitude. You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do they think they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here. Alright? I'm an American. And I'm owed something. Look, they took it from me.
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
What are you trying to communicate? Tell us.
No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?
So what do you wanna do?
No one does nothing, Jeff.
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
My goal is to make art.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
I've run out of words.
You're unbelievable.
Good, man.
Yeah, they could be songs.
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
Comment, say things, think. Whatever. Why are you so special?
No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know.
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.
Why should I call the police, huh? They don't so any good.
What about this, huh? Go ahead, big man.
Look, get down off my property.
Is that your driver?
No, I'm going.
Me?
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
Your manager?
Just one?
Hey, your gonna regret this.
I'm going out later.
This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!
I'm in, too.
Look, you're fat, Diane.  You're fat, fat, fat!  Because you eat, eat, eat!  What?!  She keeps asking because she wants some honesty.
Oh G-d, I'm sorry... You're not really fat!  I was just saying that because, uh, I thought that's what you wanted me to say.
Okay, even with all our savings, it's still only six hundred fifty-four.
Di, it's Luce.  Kansas just called and said she's going to "fuck me up!"  Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had to go.  I think her Grandma had another heart attack.  Anyway, why does she want to "fuck me up?"
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
"No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat?
NO!  Wait...um...  We're the A-squad from Lincoln High? So, uh...
No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.
Okay, you can't tell anybody.
My best friend got pregnant.
Kansas, I want you to meet someone special.
Say, you're not really smuggling opium these days,  are you?
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
This is Miss Kramer.
Name dropper.
You forgot this.
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
Well....
No, Phillip, no.  We must be strong.  You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards!  Furthermore, you can have the phone now.
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
What about all those ideas you had?
Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ...
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.
So do I.
Oh, you --
I'm sorry.  I don't usually read private cigarette cases.
Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
Ever been in one of these old Hollywood palazzos? That's from when they were making eighteen thou- sand a week, and no taxes.  Careful of these tiles, they're slippery. Valentino used to dance here.
Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
Gordon Cole?
Goodbye, young fellow.  We'll see what we can do.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire.  I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house.
Who else ?
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
Of course it is.
I wrote that with my heart.
Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
What's that?
I want to talk to you for a minute.
I need some money right now.
How about some evening clothes?
All padding.  Don't let it fool you.
Norma, I can't take it.  You've bought me enough.
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
Did she read the script?
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.
You'd better get to bed yourself.
You are not dressed properly.
Is that so!
Some men are here.  They asked for you.
That's what I told them.
Whose room was this?
No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
How is she?
What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours?
You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?
Paramount studios.
Cameras? ...What is it, Max?
Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.
Like it?
We're from different worlds.
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
I'm not mad at you.
You think so?
But what if---it wasn't real?
Before you go...
And you can see how you feel about me, right?
She's right. They'll string her up.
Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
What about my proposal?
Yes.
I am almost an adult. This is what I want.
Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in outer space. And we're in inner space.
No thanks. You go on.
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.
You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
What's it like?
Zaltar, please help me.
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
I heard my mother ask you once "how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?" She was wrong, Zaltar, you have a generous heart.
What's that? Never saw anything like that.
Yeah? What do you want?
Tuesday.
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?
Say, Brad. I think he'll be better off doing it his way.
You know what's the problem?
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
Peanut butter and jelly.
That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there --  on a Wheat King thresher.  Do you think I could do it? Do you?
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
Uh...excuse me, folks...
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
Sonofagun! Look at this here!
The boss wants to see you.
I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...
Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!
But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?
When?
What?
He sure wasn't actin' bad and nasty that day in Smallville. Man, he was so full of niceness I was startin' to feel funny about layin' that chunk of...
I told you it wasn't no jive.
How you doing down there?
Whatcha wanna stop here for?  Not that I ain't glad to be on the ground, y'understand.
Thanks.  Let's go
I know, by computers.
Who's the other woman?
What about you?
Why do I have to do this?
Ricky?  Where...what...
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
I thought you'd never get here.
Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number.  The prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.
Mr. White, the next number, please?
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
Jimmy, how's the -
Anybody been hurt?
Uh. . .
I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
I didn't think I wanted to.
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.
I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .
. . . Superman?. . . . .
You do?
Get your head out of the clouds, Kent. Where you been  the last twelve hours?
How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.
Mush!  Mush!
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
Why didn't you go before we left?
Mr. White, the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page.
A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris
You have been given a higher form of happiness. The happiness you feel by serving others, by inspiring them to --
Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --
I never did this before . . . I have to tell you.
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
It's brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You'll write a new series -- 'Metropolis After Hours.'
They make my eyes itch.
You're late. Very late.
Gee, I don't think . . .
Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?
Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield.
Lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.
This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.
Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
What was that about?
I am an experiment? I am freako?
Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
I know, but  --
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother.
See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town?
It isn't worth getting a heart attack over, Lois.
For what? Oh, I've see the way the other half lives. My sister, for instance. it looks terrific, but is that what I really want? Three kids, two cats, and fifteen needlepoint pillows? I'd go bananas after one week. Hell, I need this crazy existence of mine.  Like I need the plague, right? That's what your thinking.
Can I take you to the airport?
Is that what they're calling him?
See?
Ahh. 'National Geographic." In my day, this made 'Playboy" look like Mother Goose.
About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano.  Ahh, the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another, y'know? Y'know?
Will you abide by the Council's opinion?
What're you writing, Lois?
Boy!
It's a ...baby.
We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota, and just now orphaned.  Poor thing.
Lara, please...
Lois, take Kent there and introduce him around
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
How old are you?
What about this X-Ray vision of yours?
Is it true you're impervious to pain?
Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
What is this??!
Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!
Ally.  That's right.
We're...not together.
Well, it was nice meeting you again, Mr. Stephens.
I hope she gets better.
It just seems...kind of weird.
I don't know.
So what brings you out tonight?
I don't see how that concerns you, Billy.
Well, it being so depressing and all.  But it's reality.  You can't just turn this off because you happen to think it's a bad idea.
I've tried to stay out of it.  But it turns out that's not so easy, Sam.  You've gone and got yourself this lawyer.  Mitchell Stephens. You and Risa and Wendell and the Ottos.
Have you been waiting long?
What time's he coming home?
What are you thinking?
Yes.
Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses?  That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?
Why did you do that, Billy?
Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.  They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.
I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.
He knows that?  Billy?
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
You heard what Abbott said?
Anything you didn't understand?
You want a cup of tea or something?
Hey, Billy!  What brings you out on a night like this?  C'mon in.  Take a load off.
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
I don't like thinking about the accident.  I don't even remember it happening.  Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and...
It was snowing.
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.
Do you have a room?
That's the local bar?
Crafts.
Nothing's wrong with trying to talk to me, Zoe.
The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.
We do.
It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger.  Not their grief.
Yes.
Yes.
Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?
That was great.
Of course.
How do you like it, Nicole?
Are you sleeping?
Will the police do anything to her?
Don't even think of the Bilodeaus or the Atwaters.  They're all inbred.
Come on boys, break it up...
Joe, give my nephew a drink.
That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?
I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...
Well, son, looks like you went out and bought yourself a packet of trouble...
Sidney is a liar!
Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
When I'm certain, I'll let you know...
And I believe that's precisely where I read it, too.  You see, J.J., where I get my reputation for being the best-informed man in Washington.
Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.
Say hello to Sidney Falco.  Tickle him - he's been a bad boy tonight. He called you my fat friend.
Why don't you answer the man, Sidalee?  He's trying to take you off the hook.
Yes, with your clients' names attached.  That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world!  Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!
You told me you'd break up that romance - when?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
How?
Are you listening?
J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.
Sidney, I told you -
I thought he would.
Is Frank D'Angelo around?
You were thrilled to be interviewed.  Were you "interviewed"?
Rita, say hello to Otis Elwell.
Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I?  A bowl of fruit?  A tangerine that peels in a minute?
Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...
No, an arm, he said.  I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...
Yes, but as a new subscriber you're under no obligation to take more than three books.  And if you mail the enclosed card within ten days --
I swear, Sidney, I can't help it - sometimes I wonder what I see in you...
You're talking very fast.
Give him credit---the boy's gall is gorgeous!
We stick in each others craw.
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?
I know that bit - you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength! So what do you pick such weak sisters for?  Don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire, not with tear drops?
Steve, I...
No!  I'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother!
You going to work all day?
I can't
Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a hangover.  Meet the pilot.
Please... let... the kids... go...
My God.
Yeah?  Who sent you?
Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that? You can't just go around killing people!
Affirmative.
Excellent.
Will it melt in there?
It must end here... or I am the future.
Yeah.  Drag, huh?
Mom?  You okay?
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.
So what do you think, Doctor?  I've shown a lot of improvement, haven't I?
You look like handmade shit.
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
Isn't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor's baton, isn't that true?
You bet.
Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwängler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
Colonel. He had no sisters, no brothers, only a lot of love affairs.
Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?
Think you can get me any of that?
I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwängler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a non-Party member?
Why were they going to arrest you?
Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
Who?
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor.
Stop this, please, stop this now!
I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.
Everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the Jews. But--  I have things here you said and wrote. Listen to this: 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International.' And what about this: 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music.' 'Jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples, lacking roots.' You deny you said these things?
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
Do you know what that is?
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.
The only thing I know is he's an anti-Semite.
One of your people told me.
And ask him about his private life.
Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
Aren't I worth waiting for?
Mmm.  Same schedule's okay.
Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be?
I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.
I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time.
You must have a girlfriend.
So, it's from the future, is that right?
Stop!  I don't want to know. Hold still.  So...it was John that ordered you here?
Good field-dressing.
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
Let's go.  Time to move out.
What's that?
And so you feel nothing.
What are you doing?
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.
Here's her driver's license.
Christine!   Mister Van Orton is a valued customer...
I was trying to tell you... it's a game.
I'm sorry, about this...
Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... "
I'll wait.
What exactly do you do?
I know the owner of Campton Place.  I could talk to him in the morning.
Okay.
You can talk while I drive us to the police.
It wasn't his fault.  He thought it was his only way back.  They fleeced him real good.
They did the same to him as they did to you.
Where'd you get that... ?
It's mine...
It is.  It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money.  Nobody stole anything.  They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
Don't move, you bitch... !
Hi.  Didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part.
You look good.
Really?
They make your life fun.  Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
You've heard of it.  You've seen other people having it.  They're an entertainment service, but more than that.
It's a profound life experience.
What's this all about, Connie?
How do you know?
The phone's dead.
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
Where's Christine?  The waitress.
What happened was, I'm on vacation, alone... I was robbed, at gunpoint. They hit me and ran.  Two men, a few blocks away.  They took my wallet, money... all of it.  So...
We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
May I make two suggestions... ?
How long will these take?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.
Not much, I think.
I'll send your regrets.  Honestly, why must I even bother?
"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.
What the fuck... ?!
Anything wrong... ?
Someone's playing hardball.  It's complicated.  Can I ask a favor?
He hasn't called back.
These old Victorian houses are great, aren't they?
The children.  The children Hugh Crain built the house for.  The children he never had.
And this is my assistant, Mary Lambretta.
So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
Malcolm, this is essential work I'm doing.  Just think what my research can do for education. Elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports, where loud noise is random; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read.
No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
Nell.  Good enough.  And I'm Jim.
Is there something about the house?
That's where she hanged herself.
Not really.
You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?
Are you sure?
Not for you, clearly.
Am I a thing?
What's the matter?
We think someone is here.
No.
Same as last time -- the rest after.
I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.
Man knows what he likes.
That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.
This bloke she was bunked up with.  This Terry what'sit.
Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
Boomerang.
I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops?
You're kiddin' me, right?
Valets, eh?  Aren't we all la-de-da.
What d'you say, Elaine?
I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.
What was that, then?
Said it went on for donkey's years.
Oh, it just ended, then.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
I see.
You don't believe it was a car accident.
Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night.  She called me, asked if she could come over.  She and Terry had been -- having some trouble.  Lately.  I don't know about what.  On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.
What did you do?  To make them take the early 70's away from you.
I don't believe it.
I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.
Fancy it?
Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.
Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.
Hey.
Like what.
He's expecting you?
Exercising my visitation rights.
Ann--
Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?
Hello, Rachel.
You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--
A goose, friend. I was chasing a wild goose. Ed, have you ever heard of venture capital?
I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
Right! Strictly business.
Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
Uh-huh.
...You know... who *who* is?
Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
Your place?
I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it.
Rye.
...Hell, I hope I've done the right thing.
...Doris--
Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?
Not guilty, your honor...
Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.
...Probity.
Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money.
Ed, how're you holding up?
Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here.
I don't work here. My wife does.
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
...so you tie your own flies, Ed. I mean, if you're really serious. You tie your own flies, you do a--I know it's matickless, I know, people say, hey, you can buy flies at the store-- but you can buy your fish at the store, Ed, you see what I'm saying?
...You ever wonder about it?
'Lo, Ed.
...You're Ed Crane?
...Look, pal, it's a tough break, but, uh... well damnit, your wife's been pinched.
...Yeah, it's a tough break.
I'll go down and speak to him.
My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
Who are you?  The undertaker?
Saliva test?  You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?
Nice to see you, Lieutenant.
What happened?!
We've met.  The Hacksaw Murders.  '89.
With all due respect, dear, that's bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  You've left me in the dust.
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw.  "Species unidentified.  Genus: unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male, weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain capacity, 900 centimeters." That means it's highly intelligent. "Quadrupedal."
I'm coming with you.
Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock.
How many storage areas are there?
Are there any hidden rooms or staircases?  Places where someone could hide?
Where is that?
We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.
Margo, this is too dangerous.  You always think you can solve everything.  This time you don't have enough information.  The animal might behave in unexpected ways.  Leave her here with me.  Don't put her in danger.
What's that?
What do you do?
We're not supposed to go back there.
And it snuffled the ground like a dog.
It's alright.  I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place?
Oh... my... God!
Jesus, what is this?
If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my PhD.
Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.
These plant fibers are loaded with hormones!
This is it.  This is what he, or it... is after!  The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping. What is this?
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.
Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.
That's not what I saw.
Pendergast?  Are you all right?
Wounded?
What is it doing?
What happened?
It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean?
We have to try and draw it off!
That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing.  The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!
I don't believe it.
Just like John.  He won't listen.
I'm sorry.  I don't have anything for at least a month.
Close up?
What happened down there?
Are we talking Emmies?
Of course, Truman has always been very much in on casting.
People forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running.
How can they have a child?
I've got to talk to you.
I think I'm mixed up in something.
Stay where you are!
Hi, honey.  Look at this.  It's a "Chef's-Mate."  Dicer, slicer and peeler in one.  Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.
Oh, God.
It'd be an adventure.
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
Truman, what about that sign?
--What are my plans now?  Well, next I'm thinking of tackling the Yuba River in an authentic canoe from the Algonquin tribe. --I'm talking about the north fork, a class five rapid - only I'm not going <i>down</i> the Yuba, I'm going <i>up.</i>  Do you honestly think for one minute I'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents...do you?
How are you, Mother?
--Darling--
We ought to be getting you back, Mother.
You got it.
--It doesn't matter.  Everybody knows about it.  They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.
How's it going, Truman?
See you tomorrow, Truman.
Why don't you go home to the old lady --
Of what?
Its effect on the host has changed. The virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. It's developed a way to modify the host body.
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
Feds are looking for him, too.  Real nice business he's got, huh?
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.
Those people were already dead.
You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?
I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
What was it?
Mulder...?
Where are you, Mulder?
What? What are you talking about?
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
What did you find?
You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue?
And where are they going with it?
What are my choices?
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
It may be extraterrestrial.
Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.
You hear that?
Sit down, they're still talking to Agent Scully.
-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
Is she alive?
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
Why are you telling me this?
You have precious little time. What I've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in your hand the power to end the project.
Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.
She adores you.
I'd be there for him.
You're sure?  Any more nightmares?
This is Stargher we're talking about?
COME ON!
You sure about this?
I heard Julia and John got married.
He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work.
What now?
That's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely.  We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
Into Stargher.  Inside...
I have done this, you know.  Been inside.
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
So?
The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match.
We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  Maybe he owns property somewhere.
You sure you want to go through with this?
Right here.
You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit?
You were in love with him, weren't you?
Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was.
...at all.
The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.
Can I hear you?
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
Gestern bein heurigen...
Tell me about him.
Seemed like a good idea.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
I wish I knew.
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
That's the reason.
He works in a military hospital.
I want the truth, Miss Schmidt. We know he is alive.
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.
See much of him before that?
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
What do you want to see a doctor for, huh?
Next, Paine.
So would I.
...in the morning.
Calloway!
Paine lent me one of your books; "Oklahoma Kid," I think it was. Read a bit of it... Think it's pretty good. What made you take up this sort of thing? Been doing it for long?
What time is it?
Be sensible, Martins.
It's a military hotel.
Do you know his number?
...this lecture business, you'll put me up here a while?
Hello, Harry.
You told them, didn't you?
Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?
It's wonderful how you keep the tension.
...you know and all that.
...the best way one can, you know.
Mr. Popescu is here tonight.
Are you mad?
Dr. Winkel?
...Popescu...
Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
Kurtz.
I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.
Something wrong.
Should I make it all fact?
...Mr. Martins?
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to.
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.
We think in miles, not kilometers.
What about Moliere?
We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.
Did you sleep well?
So from there to there?
That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them.
Too far?
...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it....
What do you care?
Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a different moment. Things were possible that aren't now.
You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness?
How come there's no punctuation?
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.
Where are they?
With you there's a tragic dimension.
Payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem...
V'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. And make no graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because He's not like anything. Not only can't you see Him or hear Him, you can't even think about Him. I mean, what's the difference between that and Him not existing?
No, I think you shouldn't.
You're learning the Hebrew really fast.
You want a punch in the mouth?
Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.
Danny, the night we met, you said the name Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed. We were excited. But here it is September, and Mr. Manzetti is still walking around breathing the air.
We want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream: works like <i>The Bell Curve</i>, <i>Sociobiology</i>, anti-Zionism, anti- immigration, the com-munitarian issue.... We'll hold conferences: invite liberals, blacks, Jews. Chomsky, Cockburn, Stanley Crouch, Shahack....
Is it okay if I record this?
Curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker.
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?
I don't think you know what you are.
Who killed Manzetti?
I always won.
Think about your father. Your sister.
You shut up. Who do you think you are?
I don't do that.
Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.
How have things been going?
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
Which was his room?
I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brand-new power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up timer.
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
Take a right on 59th...  We'll put it someplace else.
You remember Miriam....
How did you know they were Jews?
Adam Sandler.
Not like Mr. Dorfmann.
After your mother died, that's when you stopped going to shul. Doing your homework. Everything.
'Cause they got rid of Johnson. He knew how to deal with the assholes. Dallas Green, please...
Do you have a suit?  Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too.  And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you?
I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to...
I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
A spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent.
Where did you two meet?
He looks strange, doesn't he? Like a baby that just learned to walk.
And just where are you from?
Huh?  Well listen to him!  Do you hear that?
He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm going to beat you".
And the lights!  Running lights, stealing stretchers...!  You'll have us in jail.
You risk your life when you cross the street.
Five minutes and fifty seconds.
Dollars.
Plenty of women everywhere right?
What's with the voice?
That's good.  You never would have recognized me, huh?  Check out the suit! Looking good, no?  You know I'm the world champion?
I dove 315 feet!
Why?
It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere else.
No.
... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her. Two years later I couldn't even remember her name!  Let me tell you, time erases everything!
I'm concentrating.
A drink to warm up?
In the lake?
I'd better get back now.
Jacques, you set a world record.
Then, tell me a story.
I'm being a pain, huh?
What?
You've got to tell me what happened?
This is the hotel San Domenico?
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
What kind of name is that?  To be named after a city?
You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled.
It's his heartbeat.
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
I'll go see how he's doing.
Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen.
So. Do you have a name?
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.
What!?
Oh my god. She's become my pimp. And she's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder.
Esther!
So don't show a picture.
Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...
But we're not open on Sundays.
Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?
What's wrong with him?
Wait! Before we enter, you need to know that my research has determined that Santa's compound is wired with the XP 2000 stereo type alarm system.
What are you doing?
Well, he's kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend.
When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.
Mmm———yes.
They don't say it to me.
Charlie wasn't drunk last night.
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
And here is Three Tree Mesa -- and here I go out of the big arroyo --
What did they say before the bad card came up?
Well -- did he give you a lot of money?
Something black —- something on its way to you ——
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches ——
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life —- and I still don't know what the Procession means.
Well, I'd best be off.
Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
Yes, but what sort of a man?
Yes. There have been men who kill for pleasure -- strange pleasure. There was Blue Beard in France -- Jack The Ripper in London. It's not uncommon.
To the eye? Like other men.
Tell me.
Galbraith knows something. He as good as said so ——
Makes no difference. Get him out!
Are you all right?
Who is he?
——	As long as my feet held out.
Jerry, these flowers aren't really for me ——
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
I hated you that day —- you and your flip talk -— with that little girl lying dead.
Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh?  Her brother’s death.
It’s a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. I’m told it retails at around £4,000.  I see you don’t require a definition.
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.
I still don’t buy your story but I figured it can’t do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry. Besides, if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner, we could always get the right people onto you. I trust you know who I am talking about.
Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?
You lost my money?
You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.
When did you get back?
Huh! Don’t you recall convincing me he had?  You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.
Is there anything to understand?
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child supplier’s being tailed?
To get me killed...?
Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brother’s not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will...
So you did talk about it, huh?
Directory enquiries. Can I help you?
You don’t know why he’s come to Los Angeles?  The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his?
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what we’re doing here?
...I’m Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this that’s who I am. Do you get what I’m fucking saying, Mr Lombard?
We’ve still got the Italian...
Look at him, Whitney. Come all the way from England to clean up California. Huh!
I’m calling about the puppies.
You’re not playing with little boys now, scumbag. Where is the Austrian?
Yes. Friedman’s the fuckin’ Austrian!
Where are we?
Does Mr Gluck call for his messages?
Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
“La collectionoose”. It’s about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. It’s on TV tonight and as I’m in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says it’s about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The director’s supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?
Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say you’re my secretary, all right?
Good afternoon, Mrs...?
What happens now?
Am I supposed to know him?
Where is Friedman?
Maybe I don’t.
I’m overcome by your public-spiritedness.
The Hyatt...? What’s that?
At what time will you be available?
What is it?
What are you going to do now? Call the police?  Take him away? I must warn you he’s terrified of men, so...
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...
Fine...
Bye. And thanks... Nathalie gently closes the door, eyes Lombard who shakes himself awake... rolls her eyes and surveys the room...
But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.
So why didn’t he?
Very funny. Can I go on now?
Jean, it's... it's not so easy...
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
I also need someone who can read and write.
I thought you were an archer?
Jeanne...!  Are you alright?
They've abandoned me... like everyone.
It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
I am ready now...
No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size.  Am I correct, Bishop?
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
It is not for us to burn her, my lord.  That is your prerogative.
Whose side are you on, Cauchon?
Who are you?
Take the Holy Gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked.
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
What did it tell you?
It is for us to determine whether you are a good Christian, not you.
20,000?!  But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed.
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
You mustn't see her, my lord.  We know nothing about her... we don't even know if she is from Lorraine.
Your majesty, I really think you...
... as always, majesty...
He's probably right -- let's call a delay...
I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
So... what is the message?
Brilliant idea... but to be really effective, why not send a whole army of virgins?
There must be something we can do for her for Chrissakes!
Clear?
Jeanne... let him do it.  One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?
Bravo!  What about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  Do we let them go too?
But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
Stop it!  What are you doing?
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
I... I never lied!
That's too easy.  One minute you want to die, the next you want to live...  Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?
Why were you yelling like that?!
Yes... yes!  And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery?  Why didn't he?
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
There's nothing for me to do here anymore... I don't belong here I want to be with Him now...
Yes I am.
Is that bad?
Oh yes... very.
I want to be with him always...
I'm going to get a doctor.
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station.
Wladyslaw Szpilman.
I need help.
Must feel better this side of the wall.
wish I knew you better.
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this.  In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.
A good place for what?  He's insane!
I know.
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
Otherwise what?
Ah, here. Today's news from the other side.
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
How long have you been here?
Out of Warsaw.
What the hell are you doing?
I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.
Don't answer, he low born. Jun look at him, mongrel. Your wife where she?
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.
I worry for you.
She looks tired.
Those 80 acres, that cross the stream, what do you think of them?
Has Ada ever spoken to you?
No, but her words are in my head.  I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.
He says you're not to see her or he'll chop her up!
And when is the next lesson?
You wanted by the law or somethin'?
I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
Twist!  When did you get back in town?
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
What the hell you gonna do with yourself?
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
I just got the count.  We'll put the take on the 4:15.
He was a tear-off rat.  He got what he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay his bills.
How do you like that Coleman, huh? After three years.
We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.
Looks all right.  It's big enough and off the street.
We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at every track in the country.  You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.
Aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side.
This isn't like playin' winos on the street.  You gotta do more than outrun the guy.
You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money.  And no matter how much you take from his, he'll get more.
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
Looks like he's sulking.
He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza.  I got you one of each.  He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.
She coulda killed me last night.
Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the dominoes?
I'll tell ya what you did, smart boy.  You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies.  You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
It isn't any better.
You doin' anything tonight?
What does this guy want?
Looks like he missed ya.
I don't even know you.
Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
Hooker!
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself.
Lucky, hell.  I could do it every day.
You got the 400 grand yet?
Yeh, and what does Cole say about that?
I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
Why not?
Then just say he was sixty years old.
What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry....  What is it?
Why did that man want to kill him?
I can't help it.  You don't know.....
I can't.
Darling, don't cry.  Please.  I know it's terrible.  But isn't it really better this way?
How are you?....  Oh, I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now....  No, she isn't here.  Is it about her father?  Well, can I take the message?
No.
Then what are you hiding?
He didn't do it -- Nick!
Another Martini --
That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
How do you do?  I'm sorry we have to rush.
Where did you get this gun?
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
I never saw him before.
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
Have you got a pistol permit?
No proof?
What about Jorgensen?
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
He's holding out on you.
Trail him!  Trail who?
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
You mean that body-----?
Shut up.
I said he hadn't written me.
That's all right.  Well, we'll be going.
That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody that says that is a liar.
You'd done better to have told me that in the beginning.  Where were you the afternoon she was knocked off?
Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!
I can't remember offhand, Lieutenant.  Maybe I was over at Charlie's shooting pool. Maybe I was here.  She'd remember.
I'll get some.
I couldn't go near that woman.
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
I don't like him.
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
I can't! I haven't got it!
Oh, please, Nick.
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
Nothing, thank you.  Nothing.  I wanted to see you...  What's Mimi up to, Charles?
She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.
My wife.
Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to do with it.
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
I've never heard about you.
Why tell me?
That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
What's that?
Who is she?
By the way, how is your father's side?
I can't lie here.  I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.
Sounds like a good case.  Girl mysteriously murdered.  No one knows who did it.  They haven't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --
Where did you get that?
No.
But it's Christmas now.
Finished with these?
What's the trouble, Asta?  Your balloon busted?  So's mine.
I wish they'd stop that.  It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick?  He must be in New York....  Where do you think you're going?
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
You dog!
Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?
You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
How long has he been dead?
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
I've got a lulu -- why?
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
Nick Charles here?
I just wanted to tell you...
Home?
What's in the other direction?
What's it say?
Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is.
They shouldn't have been here.
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.
You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.
Says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam anyway.  They flew the gunship up here to hide out.  When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.
In the flack jacket.  Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile.  'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead.
You disappoint me, Epps.  Always figured you to be a man; a real bright guy.  I had respect for you.
Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you.
This is stupid.  It's going on a month now.  How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards?  They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for?
You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army?
It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
What?
You can't tell anybody about this.
Hey...hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.
I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water.
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?
Not enough.  We're out numbered and out gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.
They're going to kill us!
It looks like you're not doing anything.
He's not going to leave us.
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?
No.
I'm sorry about that, Epps.
What do you think our chances are?
I pick that way.
What do you figure it is?
Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria?
Well?
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!
What do we do?
What do you make of them?
Why do I have to lie in the road?
Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
Australia.
I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq is the pink thing.
We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses.
Come on.  You're going to get us in trouble.
He says it's a box.
And you're the guy who's going to open it.
It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.
Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?
This is too much.  You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
Iraqis.
Yeah!  Yeah!
How long we going to keep this up.
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
We're American soldiers.  We don't abandon people.
Think we can make it?
You down?
You're going to burn up in those.
When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs.  They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy.  America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out:  They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert.  They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something.  And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis.  See how I mean?
I can't hear him.
When?
I haven't done anything.
Look, food!
You slipped on a T297 transfer just before lunch, didn't you?
What are you doing?
no...no, no.
Wait!  I'll talk to him.
How far did you go?  Was it cold?
What's going on?
I don't understand. Living....selection is computed. You can't... What have you done to LUH?  She was here..
Maternity ward, huhh!
I don't know.
Oh, That!  I'm 5555 SRT Entron..
This one has eyes.  Why did they leave your eyes? Could you ever....
No...no you're wrong.
Just look at all those people.
Yes.
Just do it.
What?
Now wait just a fucking-
Only once, at Redstone.
Nitro-cellulose. What is that, some kind of explosive?
You guys seem pretty tight.
Glass, Eighth Street, alley behind Grand Hotel. Cut him off.
C'mon, talk to me! We can do it!
Good, now the other side.
More metal... sharp edge...
What do you think?
Right.
You got it.
No, we're terrorists, stay back or we'll blow.
Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.
Who are you calling, sis?
What the hell was that?
You touch me again and--
Prints?
Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ...
Next week we work the park.
Vice cop on a homicide?
Got it! Ace Match Company, Flint, Michigan.
Reilly, what the hell are you-?
Yes.
M'sieu Giron is downstairs.
Eleven o'clock! 
Pardon me, m'sieu, but I have the feeling we have met somewhere before.
No.
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
Yes, sir?  What shall we start with, Baron?
And as for you, waiter--
Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
Monescu.
You see, the bag has just been found, and the reaction of relief from her former excitement and strain is just a little too much for her. It's not very serious, but just the same we'd better not take any chances.
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
Please.
Thank you, Baron.
Right.
--the other half, contrary to custom, shall be delivered in cash into Madame's personal custody.  Darling, that means that on the second of June we'll have eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!
Five, seven, and nine--
No--not yet--but--  Two tickets to Berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... Right ... Right ... Leave them in the name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... Right ... Thank you. 
Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
Now, Lily--
And you--
Then you go into the foyer.
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.
What shade of powder do you use?
Beautiful specimen.
Oh? 
Marvelous.
Like that!
Ah, let me have a little fun.
Lovely.
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
No, m'sieu!
Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?
How much time?
Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.
Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats?
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
Who's the best? Say it.
Shit.
So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic?  That's great!
Rush her.
Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.
The one on the other side is letting men in.
You told me to change.
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --
I had hoped you would come to me last night.
This should be amusing.
There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.
You know somebody?
How you two doin'?
Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed too. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of Titanic must make headlines!
HELP! HELP!!
Hello again.
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
What's this?
You liked this woman. You used her several times.
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
Jack, must you go?
You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.
Are you nervous?
You're trembling.
Looks okay. I don't see anything.
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?
Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.
It's been 84 years...
I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley, and it will insure our survival.
Rose, get in the boat!
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
Well--shall we go into dinner?
So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York.  Oh--there's no accounting for tastes--  Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
Good afternoon--
Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.
Isn't she lovely?
How do you do. Would you care to finish the game? I have a slight earache.  --and it's so noisy up here.
--that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.
You're lucky--out my way, in Montana, there's nothing else to do--
You're coming back--
And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.
She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful. 
Aw--give a feller a break. My cards are on the table-- I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?
You know, you're not a <U>bad</U>-looking girl. In fact--I think you're lovely.
Don't be a c-a-t.
When?
Thanks.
Good night, Mrs. Brett!
I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.
You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
Here--drop it where they'll find it and return it to him. He's not a bad egg. I'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive.
Here's your twenty-five hundred, Mr. Brett.
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
You keep it-- 
I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett.
I'm going to the show--
Nice girl, that--  I'd hate to see <U>her</U> get a raw deal.  You know, the great trouble with crooks is they're <U>too</U> smart. Now if I'd taken that bracelet, I'd find some way to slip it back--I'd know I could never get ashore with it.
No--I'll take Sally and give you the best of it.
That's too bad.
I won't--I'll ask for one right now.  Sally tells me she's in love with you.
Here you are, sir. 
"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
That's me!
I can see where I won't talk much to you.
Hello, Denby!
Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank.  Where is your wife?
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
Is that one of the Who's Who?
I wish I could.
He's all right.
Not because of Ned.
Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
I thought I had our sailing covered up--  --and here it is.
I'm all right.
Nothin'.
Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just Hit town?
So how's Tombstone treating you?
A peace officer... Impressive man
Feel bad about ol' Fred.  Just Can't hold back when I'm feelin' Woolly.  Still, feel kinda bad. But now we're square.  Anyway no Use for holdin' a grudge.  I Deserved a rap in the head.
Fair enough.  You know I got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this.
I want you to know it's over. We're leaving and we're not Coming back.
I said forget it, answer's no, I Don't want the job and that's Final.  I'm going to Tombstone and Nothin' short of dyin's gonn Stop me.  Good day.
That's the rumor.
I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
Here, Doc.
I calculate that's the end of This town.  And let's don't bother About the luggage, darling.
Very cosmopolitan.
I see.  And what would you do if "she" walked in her right now? WYATT "She"?
I don't know.  Probably ignore her.
I'm a man without fear, Wyatt.  I Literally don't care if I live or Die.  But even I can't fight human Instinct.  Somebody suddenly Starts shooting at me, I duck. But you... what on earth were You thinking about?
No.
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason.
There they go.  Look kinda like preachers.
We're the law, ain't we?  Well the Law don't ride around vermin-
We've never actually met.  My Name's-
You're a little touchy about it.
See?  You're laughing again.  But That's what I want.  Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea Of heaven.  Need someone to share It with, though.
So I assume we're regarding this As just a kind of interlude.
Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.
Really?  You sure?
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.
No, wait.  Please.  I know nothin' I say'll fix things but I want You to know it wasn't me.
I ain't your brother, I ain't None of your damn brothers.  Move!
There they are.  No herd though.
Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal.
It's that woman from the coach!
Listen to me, both of you.  This Is no good.  This is trouble we Don't need.  For the first time in Our lives we got a chance to stop Wandering and finally be a Family.  Do this and you throw it All away.  You saw what happened To Fred White.
Dropped him, that was it.  Sorry If I made a worse mess for you.
For a man that don't go heeled You run your mouth kinda reckless.
Talked it over.  We decided we Don't need the money.  Took out 13 Dollars each, though.  Federal Posseman's fee.  That all right?
Keep your eye on that brass ring. Don't let anything side-track you.
Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
But -
Why wasn't the ship protected?!?! Why was it sailing without radar?
Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects...  Especially one with such distinguished friends.
...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites.
...And what's that, my dear?
...So that's what the weapons grade uranium was for.
Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.
Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting like this. They may be on to us.
Your new car. 
Don't you think you're overreacting?
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?
I don't know if you'd call it a boat...
Natalya?
Can you arrange a meeting?
Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless.
Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.  And another for you?
Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.
I'll keep that in mind.
- Shut up!
I hope you'll be gentle.
And what do you call this?
Blood or Dutch?
... How did you get into marine salvage?
Not a lot of difference.
What the hell does that do?
... What's Harmsway done?
Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.
You're to wear this mask at the Venice Carnival, and wait to be contacted.
Sakwa!
Who's in charge here?
What's your name?
My name is Sidney Winch, and -
I was an attorney!
You won't get away with this!
A dead head.  Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west.  Muncy! Engines to half!
Obviously, the British government denies all of this -
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
Why don't you come in for a while?
Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right?
I was hoping you came to the door instead of him. It gets cold at night.
Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything?
Let us settle this tomorrow.
I'm worn out.
It's good to be able to hear that.
What, are you having another party?
Boy, I thought you were about to cross the river.
Those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person.
Good afternoon, ladies.
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.
I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.
Is this your house?
You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.  In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.
Did you have your child at home?
No, but I might have some Indian Chief Tonic.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
He just leeches off your parents. He is a master at wearing out welcome.
I didn't mean for you to pay me for that.
Andy!  I'm heading out the door.
I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
You'd think they've never seen a new toy before.
Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?
Yes, I can.
Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves.
My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
Ow!  Watch where you're going!
Woody, stop it!!
Come on, this way!
Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Woody!  It's the moving van.
Nice work, fellahs.  Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch!  That was a stroke of genius.
Woody?!  What are you doing?
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
Oh, boy.  Will ya take a look at all those presents?!
Hey, watch it!
Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something!
Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.
Okay, we're on the last present now...
Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.
Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
I can't hold on much longer!
Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
Finn, there's a splinter in your left foot.  If you don't let me take the splinter out, it will fester.
I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it.
Somebody couldn't wait until dark.
But then I had a brother and a sister left.
I understand.  You're upset.  You want to know what's going on.  That's good.
You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.
My Leica's gone.
Helena --
I don't know.
...How old are you?
What's that mean?
Inhale the smoke and hold it.
Are you kidding...  I'm staying with you --
You know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day?  He and my mom have cocktail hour every night, from six to seven, set your clock, two bourbons --
No telltales.  Nothing to read. Not touching my face.  Not even blinking.  No giveaways.  How're you feeling?
Chill out --
What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?
I'll put this in the back.
You may speak.
I want to know who is responsible for this treatment.
I don't think you're going to do that.
There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico.
My husband had been working on something he called, The Project for the Children.  Are you aware of this?
A group of us are going out tonight.
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
Madrigal's alive.
A place we have, that we know is protected.
One question.  How did you find about this?
The worst serial killer in history - who?  Gacy - right?  Killed forty two people.  Our government killed fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied about it every day.
I've read official estimates but I wouldn't bet my house on them.  I've heard the entire cocaine supply for the United States can fit into four tractor-trailers.  At least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope, with drivers employed by people who don't give a damn if they're caught or not.
He's a research doctor.  You're dad's a doctor, too --
Well, I've not brought them.
I'm sorry.
Well, why didn't you bring them?
I want the money, Mark, that's all.
What?
Christ, I haven't felt that good since Archie Gemmill scored against Holland in 1978.
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
Well, it isn't.
You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing. You can't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.
What? Steady like?
So, what's he like?
I read it in Cosmopolitan.
Tommy knew he had the virus, like, but never knew he'd gone full-blown.
Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.
Do you recall the school motto?
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
Thank you, Mr. Murphy. We'll let you know.
Thanks, Mark.
If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your Giro is fucking finished, right?
But try too hard --
Running time?
Director?
Who wrote it?
Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
I don't rate that at all.
I think Allison had been screaming all day, but it hadn't really registered before. She might have been screaming for a week for all I knew. It's been days since I've heard anyone speak, though surely someone must have said something in all that time, surely to fuck someone must have.
Eughh. Sounds horrible.
Did he -- you know?
Oh no, don't even mention it.
Six weeks!
Following new course. Warp seven.
On "The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"
The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
What is it you seek?
She's got partial power, sir. I might be able to take two of you.
Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two.
Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
I regret to inform you that the record for free-climbing El Captain is in no danger of being broken.
And that is?
On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy for a while?
Their equipment is primitive but effective. I recommend we land at Coordinate 8563.
Be one with the horse.
Exactly 15.5 seconds.
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
I believe I have found a faster way.
Spock... the booster rockets.
Spock... don't.
Who are you?
What are you doing?
I trust your message was received?
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
Spock...  What have you done to my friends?
About the ship...
I am a Starfleet Officer.
Sybok, you must surrender.
I know you better than that.
You did break in.
My dinner.
I want to go to his place.
Of what?
Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing. While the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it. The molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. Then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and...  voila.
Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.
Oh. Anything else?
I'm your program?
You're alive!
A User -- in our world?
You're a..."guest" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games.
Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?
Watch it!
Hey... !
So...how's the world of serious science?
A User?
Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know, a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User even wrote you...
What do you think?
Yori... hey...
How?
What is it?
We have to get off this beam!
Can you cover me for an hour?
Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell your father I may be late.
You seem fine now.
Dana, are you listening to me?
How was school today?
I seem to remember something about a history project that's due tomorrow.
Harry?  HARRY?!
Kids.  Ten seconds of joy. Thirty years of misery.
Uh huh.  And her little hormones are going like a fire alarm.  I				* say even money that physicist on				* the bike is boinkin' her.						*
Copy that.
Look at the way the little punk is driving.  He's all over the place.  Look-- he hasn't signalled once.
Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?
Give me the page.
Now what?
You've reached a new low with this one.  I can't believe you're crazy enough to use the room at the Marquis.
Any minute now.
My husband is a good man.
Look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time.  And I have to get home to my family.
Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.
Uh huh.
They said you had to run out.
Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker.
Let me out of her!  Right now!
What?
Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--
What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?
Now slide the nylons off one by one.
I don't take those assignments.
What're we talking about here? Pussy, right?
But with you, she gets to be hot, right?
Boris and Doris?
That was you?!
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
You see what I mean?  That reaction would give us away in a second.  Try to relax.
That was so good I am gonna have another.
Well, enough about the King. How about you?
What kinda music do you like?
What are your turn-ons?
That's a long time.
Do you get paid a lot?
Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.
You're a whore?
That dazzling imagination.
Is this a joke?
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.
Damn skippy. He like it, too.
Naw naw!
Ain't no man have to eat pussy!
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
Where the fuck is that bitch?
You comin' to L.A.? When?
Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way, I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.
What?
Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
Is he big league?
Yeah, well if we got lost, it's your ass.  Come on, Clarence, lets go. Elliot's going to meet us in the lobby.
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading -
Leave the gorillas.
No. No, you don't.
He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there.  He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag.
Where's everybody else?
Well, I guess it's about that time.
Elliot.
Say it, goddamn it!
Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?
That was a good fuckin' movie.
Or a bit player -
And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman.
Nicholson and I.
Suspect's words -
You see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy? You're gonna walk in my goddamn house, my house! Gonna come in here and tell me! Talkin' smack, in my house, in front of my employees. Shit! Your ass must be crazy.  I don't think that white boy's got good sense. Hey, Marty.  He must of thought it was white boy day. It ain't white boy day, is it?
Naw man, that's some serious shit.
Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!
You gotta hold this for me.
Just put it in your purse.
Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
What was the Jew-boy's name?
The food, the sky, the certain, uh, sexual temptations -- you haven't become "addicted" have you, Cole?  To that "dying" world'
He's drugged out of his mind!  He's completely zoned out.
San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you "James"?
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
Do you know what year it is?
It's just a shot to calm you.
Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
No, I think it was always you.  It's very strange.
Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!
I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?
James!  That's a policeman.  Pretend you don't know me.  If he sees you...
I don't understand what we're doing.
The boy in the well.  How did you know that was just a hoax?
You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?
No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
You... you couldn't have heard me.
So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future?
What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.
What're you writing?  You a reporter?
What....???
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
County Hospital, right?  1989.  The "Immaculate Escape" -- am I right?  Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too.
Me?  Are you kiddin?  You're the one! You were a hero, man.  They gave you a pardon!  And whadda you do?  You come back and fuck with your teeth!  Wow!
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
But you know what's real now?
He kidnapped you, Kathryn.  You saw him murder someone.  You knew there was a real possibility he would kill you, too.  You were under tremendous emotional stress.
WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT HAND.  THIS IS IMPORTANT.
WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON WALLS?  You think I told her about the Army of the 12 Monkeys?  Impossible!  Know why, you pathetically ineffectual and pusillanimous "pretend-friend-to- animals"?!  I'll tell you why:  because when I had anything to do with her six years ago, there was no such thing -- I hadn't even thought of it yet!
Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
Oh, Jesus.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
He no!
You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
You don't fear death?
Where to?
But he's dead.
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Hey.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Lord!  Put the baby in the icebox. Killed the poor thing.
Let me get your change.
Ned!  Now look at what you done! Are you all right?
For the love of God would you two give it a rest?  Lord almighty.  In all my years I have never seen anything so pathetic.  How far did you think you were going to get with this?  Neither one of you can wait to slit the others throat.  Now use what little smarts you got.  If I was going to bust you I wouldn't have waited until after you killed Jake.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
A medicine man?
My face tell you all that?
Beautiful?
All right, Grace.  No more games.
Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.
Doesn't the heat bother you?
How far is it to California?
He doesn't give it to us.  We take it.
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
Grace . . . Grace?
Where's the safe?
You don't know?  Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?
Oh, that's great.  We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. That's fucking brilliant!
There's easily a hundred-thousand in there.  More than that.
If you want.
Let's do it here.
He was going to take the money.
The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.
I can't make it.  Grace?  Grace!?
It's . . . it's locked.
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.
Why would I kill her?
Hungry?
Talk?  About what?
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead.  Well, looks like we got ourselves a pact.
What should I do?
It's not like that.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--
Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about killed some guy over a girl.  Not for money, for a girl. And she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me.  Same way Grace played us this morning.  I don't like that, Jake.  Not twice in one day.  And maybe I'm so pissed I'd twist the next off my own Grandma to get out of here.
This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom.  Now you make straight for it.
What are you babbling about?
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter?
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.  How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
Mister!
Nooo!
Yep.  Tore him up good and spat out little, refined pieces of him. Nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man.
I think you might just want to do as I say.
I didn't do anything.
What'd you think, boy?  That you were the first man to drift through this town she came on to?  Not by a long shot.  You're just the most gullible.  How much did you get?
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Oh, Jesus.
I wasn't doing anything.
Let's see...they're not very imaginative?
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm stompin' your ass.
Who the hell is this!?
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
You meant it.
I need thirteen.
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
Come on, Jake --
Two-hundred dollars?
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter for the juke?
But you was going to fight for me.
Harlin around?
Will he be back soon?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
Accident.
What the hell happened to my car?
...got no day, got no date.  Probably ain't worth a duck's fart . This one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. No sir I'll stick with this .
Look, Harlin.
Jesus.
Thank you, Bobby.
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
Nice house for a shaman's daughter.  You must be good.
My face tell you all that?
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
Are there snakes out here?
Doesn't the isolation bother you?
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world.
Please. I won't hang on you. As soon as we get there you can dump me. I don't care. I just want to get out of here.
What do you mean?
In <u>cash</u>?
Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
When you're finished with me, I'm next! I been there, baby. I been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you're on your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a queen.
Thank you. Thank you. I...I knew you wouldn't leave me, Grace.
"Arkady"
A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
Genuine Draft?
My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.
Morning Grace.
I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It's <u>you</u>. You <u>Grace</u> or nothing. The whole thing... I want you to be my wife.... What do you way Grace?
You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.
I want to stay.
Get out of the car, spread them. You can jawbone all you want or you have the right to <u>shut the fuck up</u>! You commie motherfucker. Either way you're goin' to the can.
I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death.
I remember you.
Maybe it wasn't a specific moment, maybe it--
Why?
What's he talking about?
What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
Why is it, do you think, that of all the professions in the world... you chose protection?
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
The guy might not have been carrying anything.
I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color.
He's kind of a miracle.
You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears?
You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.
No.
Yeah, hello.
He said...
He didn't say nothin', huh?
I didn't mean no offense.  I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.  Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ?
I thought I was gone. See them birds? Most times I wouldn't even notice them birds much. But I'm noticin' 'em real good 'cause I thought I was dead.
Free ones?
Yeah. See?
What I heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck.
Mmmm pistols.
No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...
Heard you done the roof yourself.
That much, huh?
I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
First off... Corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of.
Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.
I do not like assassins an' men of low character like your friend English Bob... but Bob ain't no coward who will cry to your face an' then...
Ned's share?
William Munny, yeah.
Oh.
What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on?
Yup.
You could have it. All of it.
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
How long you gonna be, Bill?
She gave me the evil eye.
I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
HEY, KID.
IS THAT YOU, KID?
Yeah?
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
Easy, Bill.
Who, Bill? Who got snake eyes?
Hullo, paw.
How many men you killed?  Ain't you gonna answer?
Who ?
A boy came across a body on the beach this morning. Thrown clear when the boat burned. Shot once in the head. Two guys from the F.B.I. just identified him.                     +
Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people.
&lt;&lt;It is longer than that. And not so dark. &gt;&gt;
They want more time to think about investing.
Don't give up on me now, Dean.
This is not right.
We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
What fence? Who?
I was out of line.
Three million?
Keaton, I can't just -
Let's say for example -
with what?
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
What did you say?
When does he post bail?
He won't go into the interrogation room.
I know you liked Keaton I know you think he was a good man.
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?
I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.
I don't know about that.
Then what?
A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.
But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew.
No...
This is all bullshit.
Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.
Counselor, you're insulting me.
Abrams.  Yes.  How are you today?
I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
What is the truth?
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
This is going to drive the ante up.
No, actually, she was referred to me.  She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
Say it.
Anything special about the case?
...of Anesthesiology?
How old are you?
Yes.    It is a crime.  A serious crime.
You would not...?
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anaesthetic.  Ideally a  patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic.'  Does that sound familiar?
And you wrote that...
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
I appreciate--a man as busy as--
The most respected ...
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of ...
We have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps.  Please don't, don't discuss ...
Who are you protecting, then?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
I'm sure it is, Frank:  and let me tell you something.  If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?   See my point?  Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Sustained.  Yes.  The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
Pardon?
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
My name's Frank.  And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth?  You want another drink?
They might.  Yes.  That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe.  They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe.  I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.   I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve.  And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham.  There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...'
Do you think it's my fault?
You do what you want.  You want to leave...You want to go kill yourself?
You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.
What are you going to do?
I have to talk to you.
You -- Listen:  you said to me, `if not now, when...'
...I have to stand up for her...
Been a long time, huh...?
John:  gimme a cuesta-ray.
Today is Tuesday.  What?
`You guys are a bunch of whores...uh...loyalty...you don't care who gets hurt...you don't have any loyalty...'
She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
What are you doing in New York...?
... fifty thousand dollars?
What does it mean?    I...I mean we, you have other tactics...
Thank you.
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
I want to buy you a drink.
But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?
Doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
How long have you been back?
How often does this happen?
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
Ernie's.
Something else. My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta. She inherited them. Never wore them, they were too old-fashioned... until now. Now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again.
How do you know all these things she doesn't know?
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
Tomorrow night? Well --
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...
I like that one.
The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?
Where shall we go for dinner?
Mmmm.
I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
What are you going to do?
Love me... keep me safe...
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
Good-bye.
How can you be sure?
Do you hear anything?
No, I can't tell you!
Where's your husband?
You've been there before. You've seen it.
No... we're together...
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
Her car is gone.
I know. Everybody tells me.
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
Well?
Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
I think I can lick it.
Step number two.
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
Pop Leibel? Sure.
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
Midge!
Around.
Mm. Better.
Yeah.
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
Well...
Jesus.
How ya doing?
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
The hell I don't.
Don't even start.
Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
We have to get going.
Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!
Where's the candy?
I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather...
If anything ever happens to me...
No way.
So. When is the wedding.
What are you talking about?
What is it?
Okay. Hi.
She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
Where do you look? What side of the neck?
What's goosed?
Nobody knows she's here.
It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."
Boyd...What have we done?
What?
What's your point?
After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep.
Okay fine.
I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
Nope.
Stop it!
Why can't we do it through the mail?
Did you send in all of the deposit checks?
What do you mean, you think so?
Florist?
Caterer?
What else have you forgot?
Are we going to do this again?
It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
Do you love me?
I need your help.
Just call and let me know that your okay.
The chairs.
What's the word on the chairs?
"Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me.
Yeah. Sure.
No way.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay.
You fucked a prostitute?
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.
He kept saying he was protected.
No...
But...
Well, I'm in the middle of my Goddamn toast here.
I'll take a ride.
That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?
Pup corn?
You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.
How like your aunt you are, even in your walk.
Yes, it is.
Yes, I don't want you ever to leave this house.
Don't lie. You don't believe me either.
It's very good.
Why the bad temper?
If you wake first, wake me up.
I don't know, sir.
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
Miss Viridiana ...
What do you know about me?
Don't forget the meeting with the lawyer. The car will pick you up tomorrow morning.
And remember, the less he eats, the better he runs.
Why are you crying?
He came in through the cupboard.
Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
You have decided to leave, Moncho.
Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?
Is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows? There must be something.
Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?
Ask the priest, miss.
Hello.
How did you see me?
I'm going to the hen house. Are you coming with me?
What are they doing in Los Feliz?
You all right?
What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
Think you can do it?
Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
What the hell happened?
You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world.
Should I have?
What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
He was re—enacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better —— to improve upon what was already done.
You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?
Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?
Who said that?
This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you.
Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality?
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!
You're not capable of it.
See something?
You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go —— right now.  Why are you going to do this?
You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!
I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you——
You can't die until you tell me where the C-4 is. Where is it?!
Thank-you, Daryl.  You had me going for quite a while there, sport.
What if he's busy tonight?
Waal, Mr. Moss, I wouldn't....
Alright, well, alright:  geopolitically...
You know what?  This is good.  This is terrific, and I'll tell you why:  it's <u>cost effective</u>.  This is....
Okay.  Here's what we're gonna do.
A small, "calico" kitten, sir.  "Calico." 
Well, get on the phone, and <u>get</u> it...
...where?
Who we got here...?
What would do that...?
What is it?
Gemme a plane.  Business Aviation, National, one hour. Fly to Chicago.  O'hare, LAX 6 A.M.
Tell, tell, tell me again.
...but...
We'll be back tonight.
...hell of a price for the country to pay.
Stanley Moss, Ladeesngennlmen... And she says...
Speaking of thanks... we puttem back in, what does your fellow Moss want?
You're tired, Ronnie.
He thinks it's too...
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
And I take this <u>opportunity</u> to suggest that, equally, I admit to <u>nothing</u>, and that I would like my lawyer present.
...where is my pill?
But, you know, <u>this</u> is the meeting, Ron?  You think about it.  <u>This</u> is the meeting.  This, here.  Schumann and us.  King Kong and the Trainers...this's it... What are you working on?
ON BREAN AND MOSS, WHO WALK SCHUMANN ACROSS THE HIGHWAY. IN THE B.G. WE SEE AMES TALKING TO THE DRIVER OF THE HARVESTER, WHO IS A SMALL, HISPANIC MAN.
Well, c'n we get him back home?
S'only got to hold for another few days.
...Yes.
Trade Re1ations.
There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber,
And you're here <u>why</u>...?
"The Country Is At War." 
They got to have something that we want.
King, King, I got a thing here, a product placement, gonna have a bigger back-end than Hattie McDaniel. Now:
What?
Yeah...?
Inaugural Speech, press corp's gonna be jealous of giving up that one...
Yeah, we'll gettem in their cars.  I'm slowing down...  No, no.  Look, lookit:  I think it's a mistake, well, I'll <u>tell</u> you why:  you got'em by the balls, <u>Squeeze</u>.  Because Schumann's the Shark.  He's ...<u>Jaws</u>.  You have to <u>tease</u>'em... You don't puttem in the first reel of the movie...  Bring'em back <u>slow</u>, the President...  No, no, put him on.  Put him on.  President wants to reveal Scbumann before the election.
We pick up Schumann.  Sneak him back inside the Beltway. And we plan his homecoming.  Zt's gone be Neil Armstrong, Dr. Livingston, and <u>Lindy</u>...They're gonna forget, they're gonna forget, they're gonna forget that there <u>is</u> an election...The Pres's gonna have to say, one of his speeches, "Don't forget to Vote..."
What the hell do <u>we</u> care?
You can't tell this story.
No, I'm On Top of it...
Pals:  Get on the <u>phone</u>... r'they flying it?
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that, Stanley...
Going to make a little stop back home, pick up my shirts, show him a little treat.
...the Suitcase Bomb.  ACT ONE Albania denies it. President comes on the air, "Be Calm."  Okay, now: Good.  Now, Alright.  Act <u>TWO</u>...  I need the following here.  Right now:  Johnnie Green, Liz Butsky, and get me the Fad King.
Jim Belushi...?
They guard our, <u>you</u> know ... "borders," night and day...
...by you?
And one of them is in love with the <u>sister</u> of...
...if I had your looks, better.
Nice guy but a loser. Lost all his equity when his firm went belly up in the recession of 71. you wanna be coming in here in your late sixties still pitching? ... Whatever happened to that cute analyst at Thudder, Wicks? ... Cindy? Susan?
What the hell...
Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe." Yuk yuk.
What brings you out here...
...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.
He's got your prick in his back pocket, son, and you're standing naked in the display window of Macy's. He's using you. Only you're too blind to see it.
Another cup of coffee?
Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.
Hello Bud, I'm Lisa, a friend of Gordon's.
Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?
So what s on your mind kimosabe? Why am I listening to you? Got to monitor my blood pressure, so whatever you do, don't upset me.
Chart break-out on this one here...uh Whitewood-Young Industries...low P.E. Explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders. Strong management.
...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.
Nice club, Mr. Gekko...
Know the name?
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
What about hard work?
You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.
Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune!
I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.
Now, wait a minute, Dad...
I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning.
The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. Look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. Bring Darien...
Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide.
If I could have anything... this would almost do.
...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...
How you doing Buddy?
Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.
He still likes you
He did?
What's that?
Well that's for me to know - but I did enjoy rubbing oil all over that big.
Anybody want another drink?
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
Hello?
Come on.
No, no James, it's not like that.  Tony and China, they're just friends.
Well?
This time I really don't see anyone man.
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
You bet.  We all can't be such modern people 
Looks a little spooky boys, you think we should do this?
I know that.
I started seeing things.
Fireball?
These are good.
How?
Your friend saw them.
What?
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
Who?
Who are you?
You should have heard her play.
She got it.  Turned it down.
You are?
What is it?
Know what I think?
Are you okay?
Does Norman know?
Something was there.  You saw it.
Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
Adamant?
By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late.
Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it.
Claire, I have to show up for the--
It's today?
It's just us now.
And we moved out here for the quiet.
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
Get down!  He'll see.
It's a flare.
Tonight?
This is the Feur thing?
How do you know this?
Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
I may have seen her on campus.
The...
"You know..."
She did it.
I know.
Thank you for this honor, my dear.
I have seen him again.  Last night.
You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?  They're reaching out to you, Rowan!
Jesus I've got - to get to the ho--
Rowan - I'm Beatrice Maytair.  Your cousin.  Deedee...you'r mother and I - we - we grew up together.
Always give the crovd a taste, darling.  Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure -
-Ellie said she died when I was BORN!  She's been alive...? ALL THIS TIME...? Why have I been lied to when -
Lasher touched you and you loved it.
Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
Mum...  Oh Mum, God will surely strike us -
Michael...  Do what you can.
Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...
You're very clever, aren't you...?
There is no one here but the dead.
you crave what I might show you.  What you can learn.  What I can give you.  So much more than Michael can.
Go on. Rowan.  Go on.
Oh god...
Let me go...  Michaelllllll...
Harder...
Yessss...
What else did you see- Michael...?
Why don't you let at do that...?
Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there.
Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -
We're quite a pair, you and I.
Rowan...?
Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I -
I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.
Wanna snack...?
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
Michael - why would he want to hurt Stu...?
How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
You could kill me - right now, couldn't you...?  couldn't you...?!  Tell me the truth --- is it Lasher...?  Answer me!!
sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change.  You always do.
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
We'd better get to work on the papers.
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
Yes, I'm sure you could - but I can't risk you loosing your job
I lost the touch
How long have you been watching me?
Tell me how it happened...
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
What's wrong?
What is it?
I don't want either of us to come to any harm - please...
Well, what do you think?
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
You don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him!
I want you out now
It's been what, three years?
What brings the rats out of the sewers?
You're a novelist - why didn't you tell me?
Good - I've got to dash -  Say that I said hello to ELLEN for me would you...
Dr STECKLER?
Oh no sir - just making some enquiries...Just tell her that INSPECTOR TAYLOR called on you - she'll understand
Sugar?
Come on, bro. Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation...
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
Hurry.
I get it now. You and me. We're dead.
You'll never believe who's in there.
You got everything you ever wanted.
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
What gives, Don Corleone?
Hi, Teddy Bear.
I mean, what do you think?
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.
Whatever helps you cope.
I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted! Now you're ashamed of me?
Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear.
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
Well?
Can you believe that was me?
You're on the next plane home.
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
My new bike.
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
He was my Grandfather, too.
Great.
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
I don't get the distinction.
Don't write that part.
Considering this is your first time on a private jet, on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor,  you are extremely cavalier.
See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
He's on the move?
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise "The Girls of Xenia."
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire.
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
You ready for your big coming out party? Everybody's dying to meet you.
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
My father must've been amazing.
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books.  Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking.
What are you doing?
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
Talk to me Artie.
She's going to wash your Jeep?
Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right?  I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner.
Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...
Did you try to fight him?
Kelly's file.  Read it.  You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify.
Same as him.  They saw her come.  They saw her go.  They saw him follow.
Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right?  So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.
They chumped us, Gloria, right from the start.
Eliminate the competition.
Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away.  And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal.
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
At that point were you able to fight him off?
Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her.  That's bullshit.
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
Thank you, Jimmy.
Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.
He... Sam Lombardo?
Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off.
All right.  I'll have to look for it.
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
God, you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here.
Hello?
I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
I don't know.  I want to see you...
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.
No.
You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...
I could, but it's confidential.  Look, the point is, we didn't talk.  I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
You mean this thing?
Jesus, man... You okay?
Yeah, right.
I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
Always hoping.  Or this...
Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.
You feeling all right?
This is good.
Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.
What is that?
When we find him, he is mine.
My hat is off to you, sir.
I could get used to this, looking down on people.
Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests.
Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
Where'd he say he was going to do this?
You got that right.  Now get up. We're walking out of here.
The first.
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
This is something.
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa here.
You gonna be a hero, Madmartigan? I've lost half my men fighting Kael, and Bavmorda, and the Nock- maar army.  Now you and this Peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are gonna take 'em on alone?
You mean, you know who this baby belongs to?
They look like acorns.
Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.
Hey!  Somebody's coming!
As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!
She asked about you, Madmartigan.
I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
Dada, what's a daikini?
What's the magician's weapon?
We gotta follow them.
She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.
Obviously.
Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?
I've seen pictures.
Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before?
He was... like him.
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.
Don't let them hurt you.
Have you got your gun on now?
How reliable is this kid?
When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
Whacking?
But not a good tired.
But why?
Does anybody know I'm here?
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
The... bullets?
Won him over just like that.
I was being foolish?
That's God's way!
Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.
Did you find him?
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
Everything okay?
John said you're Amish.
Is the English dead?
No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
Aunt Em!
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
From now on you'll be history
Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug!
Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
...didn't you?
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?
No, no --  now don't tell me.  They -- they don't understand you at home.  They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
Yes --
Oh --
I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
Oh --
Dorothy!
Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen!
Oh, my!
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?
Supposin' you met an elephant?
As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
...free!
Um-hmm.
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?
...along.
Oh --
Dorothy next!
...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
Up!
Dorothy!
Not even a rhinoceros?
Whozat?
You don't get around us that easy!
... about Dorothy.
...Tin Man!
Quiet!
I'm not afraid of her.  I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a brain or not!  Stuff a mattress with me! Hah!
That's right.
Oh, this is terrible -- can't budge her an inch!  This is a spell, this is!
Ha -- ha -- ha --
Did you hear that?  He'll announce us at once!  I've as good as got my brain!
Oh, did - did you see that?
Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!
Whew! That wasn't my plan - but something happened, didn't it?
What about us?
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
-- Ruined my exit!
Shame you had to spot I wasn’t the real thing.
Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.
Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty open the hatch.  It can only be opened for a few seconds or we’ll sink.
We’ve got to get out.
Old friend?
Elektra?  Running King Industries?  I’ve known that girl all her life. I’m not sure she knows what she’s walking into.
007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea?
You haven’t been given an assignment in this case.
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasn’t completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
Your last chance. Take the money.
I met you at my father’s funeral.
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I don’t want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  I’m not sure he knew that.
How long has he been with you?
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think I’m a coward.
What the hell are you doing here?
If this little show is for my benefit, I’ll take you home right now.
You knew when you first saw me.  You knew it would be like this.
What are you talking about?
All this, because you fell for Renard?
It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. I’m going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfather’s name, the glory of my people.
You, of course. I need some information.
That too. Everyone does what they can to survive.
Where’s the sub going?!
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
What is this place?
I’ll send someone out.
Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didn’t think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
Had a lot of blood in him.
A whore fucking.
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.
Damn straight.
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
. . . What?
I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
What the hell -- ?
They're following us.
Welcome back, Night Owl.
Dan, is this -- is this New York??
Dan -- what do we do now?
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
He's a little farther gone every time.
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
What about you?
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars.
Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
Snow covered fortress. Army of bad guys. The usual.
They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it, light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?
Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde...
You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?
Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
They tell me you're an American agent.
I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse.
Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
Where'd the damn truck go?!
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
Back off, just go away you klutz. Alright, here's the story. The items in these cases belong to me. I designed them, built them, and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up.
This is your standard dart gun.
Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation...
What...?
You're serious?
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
I'll leave you two alone to talk.
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.
Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.
I've got meetings this afternoon, I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl.
That was for Anders.
It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
Scott.. I -
What's wrong with him?
How long have you been in Alaska?
Anything else I can get you?
There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
He's uptight.
You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?
How?
Is that what you're looking for?
The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
I wouldn't really have let you die, you know.  I just needed...
And who might you be?
What in God's name are you doing?
So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
Does that mean you love me?
I will!  Goodbye, darling!
Love me?
Are you suggesting I call him master???
But there's a genius inside that body -- crying out for love and understanding and normal human relationships.  I just have to find some way to re-establish his communications system.
I suppose you're right.
Oh, at least, sir.  The land alone is worth a small fortune.
Nineteen, sir.
Incidentally -- I don't mean to embarrass you in any way, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.  Perhaps I can help you with that hump.
There.
There wolf!  There castle!
Did you hear that strange music?
Did you see anyone else down here?
It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!
How?
I want that brain.
That's not bad.
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
You'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain.
It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?
Better not get too close, master. This guy could kill you.
Yes.
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm!
Would you like a sandwich?
Oh, doctor!
Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine.
Reputation.  Reputation!
Just passing through the night.
And Elizabeth has hers.
Are you ready for me?
How do you know they're done?
How long is it so far?
Another fifteen seconds to go.
Yes, sir, name, please?
Are you dictating the strategy of this war, Sir?
Lighting COGHILL' 5 cigar: Our good Colonel Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.
