<s> That's because it's such a nice one.
<s> Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
<s> Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
<s> Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
<s> What good stuff?
<s> Let's go.
<s> I hope so.
<s> Who?
<s> Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
<s> Hopefully.
<s> Queen Harry?
<s> Can we go now?
<s> I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
<s> Like you care.
<s> What?
<s> You did what?
<s> No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
<s> If Kat's not going, you're not going.
<s> The prom?  Kat has a date?
<s> Just sent 'em through.
<s> Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
<s> You wanna go out with him?
<s> He seems like he thrives on danger
<s> That's what I just said
<s> Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
<s> Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
<s> What do you think?
<s> But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
<s> I'm on it
<s> A deal's a deal.
<s> We're not.
<s> Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
<s> What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
<s> An attempted slit.
<s> Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
<s> Who?
<s> Oh, right.  Friday.
<s> I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
<s> Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
<s> See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
<s> I hate him.
<s> You know what they say
<s> What?
<s> Busy
<s> Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
<s> C'mon.  It's not that bad
<s> Something like that
<s> How?
<s> For. . . ?
<s> Fallacy.
<s> No one else knows
<s> I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
<s> Because you're making decisions for me.
<s> No, Daddy.
<s> Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
<s> We're your guys.
<s> Good enough.
<s> It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
<s> Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
<s> Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
<s> Dr. Ruth?
<s> We'll all go crazy...
<s> Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
<s> Excellency, you are right.
<s> Your life, and that of others!
<s> Is that all that interests you? Gold?
<s> IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
<s> I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
<s> I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
<s> Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
<s> I'm not bargaining!
<s> Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
<s> Thousands.
<s> With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
<s> Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
<s> Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
<s> Colon!  Don't!
<s> Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
<s> You are bound by an oath, Father.
<s> No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
<s> The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
<s> We don't need to know.
<s> You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
<s> Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
<s> Where are we going?
<s> I was all of these.
<s> Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
<s> They won't until this is over.
<s> No.
<s> I know.
<s> They're not gonna send you right back.
<s> I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
<s> No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
<s> It was my decision, not his.
<s> I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
<s> Yeah, right.
<s> It's okay.
<s> We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
<s> You're Polish?
<s> Stay here.
<s> I'll call it... tails.
<s> Better than one.
<s> What's your accomplishment.
<s> You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
<s> Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
<s> Hey.
<s> Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
<s> Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
<s> Not what.  Who.
<s> That's unique.
<s> Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
<s> Dog food.
<s> What?  It doesn't work that way.
<s> You'll be my first.
<s> Where is escort service?
<s> Two weeks holiday.
<s> Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
<s> I want to document my trip to America.
<s> Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
<s> Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
<s> You said speak Czech!
<s> Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
<s> Sit down!
<s> Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
<s> Surprise!  Surprise!
<s> This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
<s> Alright.  Go ahead.
<s> Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
<s> Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
<s> What are you coming here to do?
<s> Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
<s> There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
<s> It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
<s> Not good.
<s> Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
<s> ...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
<s> We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
<s> Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
<s> Yes.
<s> I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
<s> Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
<s> Are you reasonably awake?
<s> Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
<s> Yes, I know.
<s> In three days, darling, I hope.
<s> How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
<s> Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
<s> I will if I can, Frank.
<s> There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
<s> Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
<s> Let me see the tracking alignment display.
<s> I want to pick up my car.
<s> Hammond.
<s> Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
<s> Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
<s> Would you guys...
<s> What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
<s> Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
<s> I got a lot to protect.
<s> Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
<s> It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
<s> Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
<s> Thank you.
<s> She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
<s> But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
<s> Must be billy's girl.
<s> One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
<s> Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
<s> Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
<s> You sure that's the reason?
<s> I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
<s> Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
<s> Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.
<s> Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
<s> Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
<s> I didn't have the time.
<s> Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
<s> Shit.
<s> Hey ... Dick Tracy.
<s> What?
<s> What's wrong with that?
<s> I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
<s> Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
<s> Jack?  What was that?
<s> Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
<s> Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
<s> Where is he?
<s> Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
<s> Don't give me this, we were partners.
<s> It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
<s> This ain't a credit business.
<s> Corn-i-Lius?
<s> Napoleon... small.
<s> You know exactly where they are!
<s> No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
<s> I'm fucked!
<s> ...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
<s> No thank you.
<s> Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
<s> So you do know her.
<s> Dallas. Korben Dallas.
<s> And then?
<s> This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
<s> What is?
<s> Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
<s> On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
<s> I was talking to the cat.
<s> Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
<s> ...Leeloo.
<s> We will be ready, Lord.
<s> Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
<s> Crystal.
<s> Got it...
<s> Fuck it! Hold tight!
<s> Yeah... then I sighed... like this.
<s> What mission?
<s> I thought you were divorced.
<s> Apipoussan!
<s> OK, you can turn around!
<s> I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
<s> The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
<s> Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
<s> This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
<s> An elephant couldn't crack it.
<s> Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
<s> I understand.
<s> I know.
<s> Why the gun?
<s> I don't know what to say
<s> The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
<s> Hmm.
<s> And they are?
<s> Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
<s> Any good?
<s> You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
<s> Don't bore me with that bullshit.
<s> Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
<s> Don't think I won't.
<s> The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
<s> Shut your mouth and drive!
<s> Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
<s> Pardon me?
<s> Max.
<s> You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
<s> How much?
<s> Sounds good, pops.
<s> Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
<s> A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
<s> Where does he sell it?
<s> Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
<s> I'm a working stiff, pops.
<s> I try to be.
<s> We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
<s> Will you watch it and see for yourself?
<s> I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
<s> I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
<s> Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
<s> They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
<s> We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
<s> There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
<s> No.
<s> There wasn't one.  The police looked.
<s> No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
<s> Will you let me look?
<s> I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
<s> She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
<s> You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
<s> I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
<s> No, you may not.
<s> What?
<s> It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
<s> Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
<s> We have matching luggage.
<s> Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
<s> Extra money, huh?
<s> Three days.
<s> Who?
<s> Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
<s> It's okay, we're just about there.
<s> Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
<s> Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
<s> You just stay put.  You need rest.
<s> Who said I...wait, what?
<s> Yeah...I guess.
<s> You're right.
<s> Me too.
<s> I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
<s> Sobering...
<s> Since my little girl became a mom...
<s> No, the Dan part was nice...
<s> No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
<s> I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
<s> That's their problem.
<s> Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
<s> Who?
<s> Yeah...
<s> I can't listen to this.
<s> It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
<s> Dead?  Matter of fact, he's much better. He's left the hospital.
<s> Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
<s> I guess.
<s> A lot of people think like that.
<s> 'Us?'
<s> Not <u>alone</u>, you're not!
<s> What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
<s> Listen!  Hear that?
<s> Oh it does???
<s> Seems to be all around...
<s> Right at our one-eyed friend!
<s> The frogmen?
<s> Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
<s> Something wrong?
<s> Why do you say that?
<s> What????
<s> What about time...?
<s> We can <u>ram</u> him!
<s> On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
<s> Obviously.
<s> I'll be another!
<s> Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
<s> But <u>answers</u> are what we need - not more questions!
<s> All right - go to it.
<s> You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
<s> Same old shit.
<s> No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
<s> Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
<s> Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
<s> You think so.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Really.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
<s> Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
<s> He sure as hell won't.
<s> Lawford?
<s> It's not that.
<s> It's stupid.
<s> I called Mommy.
<s> That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
<s> I'm not saying that.
<s> A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
<s> Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
<s> Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
<s> Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
<s> Hi honey.
<s> See you tomorrow, maybe.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Tonight. Let's get together.
<s> I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
<s> Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
<s> You knew me as a kid.
<s> I've been thinking about it, that's all.
<s> Wade.
<s> Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
<s> Yes. Here's your ticket.
<s> Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
<s> This town sucks.
<s> Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
<s> He got his deer yet?
<s> We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
<s> In the living room.
<s> Everything you know is from me.
<s> There was something. It happened up your way.
<s> They were out deer hunting, right? Jack probably heard the gun go off, then came back and found the body.
<s> What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
<s> I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
<s> Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
<s> A hunting accident is perfect.
<s> Well, I never heard that one.
<s> That's what you think.
<s> You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
<s> It was the experience of a lifetime.
<s> It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
<s> Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
<s> Like any good poker player, they're checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.
<s> why did they do that?
<s> Stand by.
<s> Copy, Air Force One.
<s> The President and I were delighted that we could accommodate you.  Now if you're all cleared?  You can follow me then.
<s> I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
<s> You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
<s> Good. Good.
<s> That isn't necessary.
<s> But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
<s> Please... don't start with me.
<s> That's my job.
<s> Sir...
<s> A MiG? Where the hell are we?
<s> Commissioner.
<s> I was reading too.
<s> Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
<s> Yes I did...
<s> Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
<s> You better check it, Unger.
<s> Sir?
<s> And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
<s> If that's the way you want it.
<s> I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
<s> Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
<s> There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
<s> Ted!
<s> Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
<s> Not when I'm with you, Ted.
<s> Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
<s> What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
<s> I mean for Ted.
<s> Is that a good sign, Doctor?
<s> Simon.
<s> But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
<s> No, I've been excited before.
<s> Simon, why has he become so... so...
<s> I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
<s> No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
<s> I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
<s> It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.
<s> We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
<s> All right.  Here.
<s> Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
<s> Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
<s> Do you have an appointment, sir?
<s> That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return.
<s> Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
<s> People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
<s> Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
<s> Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
<s> Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
<s> Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
<s> Can you fly this airplane and land it?
<s> Surely there must be something you can do.
<s> I can't tell.
<s> Yes. Yes, of course.
<s> A hospital? What is it?
<s> No.
<s> I just don't want to go over it any more.
<s> Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
<s> What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
<s> Hello.
<s> Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
<s> I will, but Jim won't.
<s> Yes?
<s> Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
<s> Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
<s> The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
<s> Yeah...
<s> Show me.
<s> I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.
<s> I am George.
<s> A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?
<s> Did you learn anything?
<s> Did you talk to him?
<s> From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
<s> Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.
<s> No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
<s> Don't count on me, George.  I never had any ideals.
<s> Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
<s> We all did.
<s> Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.
<s> Fuck procedure.
<s> No... two.
<s> Try Joshua Strader, will ya, darlin'?
<s> Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
<s> Say again?  All after incinerators?
<s> That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
<s> Well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  A termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can't move at all.  It is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  She is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
<s> Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.
<s> How long until it blows?
<s> PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
<s> What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
<s> If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...
<s> Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
<s> Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
<s> How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
<s> ...We're coming in.
<s> Alive?
<s> Six meters.  Five.  What the fu --
<s> Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
<s> But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.
<s> Maybe.  Maybe not.
<s> The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
<s> Let's waste him.  No offense.
<s> Look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
<s> Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
<s> How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
<s> Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
<s> The 'maze'?  You mean the air ducts?
<s> You're really something, ace.
<s> I'm sorry, Newt.
<s> Did you ever have a baby?
<s> Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
<s> His Grace is very angry with you.
<s> A brothel.
<s> Well, what does it matter to you?
<s> Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
<s> Why? People fart backwards.
<s> No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
<s> They'll come anyway. They love me here.
<s> Well, ask her!
<s> Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
<s> I can't write it!
<s> He's doing his best.
<s> Hey!
<s> People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
<s> Michael!
<s> You are cattivo, Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
<s> Ah-ha!
<s> Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
<s> And the result satisfies.
<s> Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
<s> Yes?
<s> In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
<s> My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?
<s> Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether.
<s> What is it?
<s> Oh, let's not talk about it.
<s> Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
<s> Do any pupils come to the house?
<s> I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
<s> They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
<s> Wolfi!
<s> What is this?
<s> Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
<s> Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
<s> I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
<s> How could I not?
<s> You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
<s> Do you mean that?
<s> The doctor thinks I am. But -
<s> So now - A minor. Suddenly.
<s> What time?
<s> Please! Just one moment.
<s> Yes!
<s> Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
<s> A little modesty would suit you better.
<s> Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
<s> Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
<s> Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
<s> Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
<s> What do you mean - now?
<s> No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
<s> At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
<s> What did he say?
<s> Warn him?
<s> Call me Alex.
<s> That's not really a very proper question.
<s> Shall I read to you?
<s> No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
<s> Not just a patient -- me.
<s> What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
<s> That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.
<s> See you later.
<s> I'm freezing.
<s> Pull over.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> Chart says he's from New York.
<s> This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
<s> I was having a nightmare.
<s> You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.
<s> So they said.
<s> I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
<s> Yes.
<s> David.
<s> I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
<s> Wrong.
<s> Come on, I'm freezing.
<s> I have no idea.
<s> I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.
<s> Pecos Bill.
<s> It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
<s> Not far enough. Come on.
<s> I'll tell you when we get there.
<s> Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
<s> Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
<s> I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
<s> The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
<s> What?!
<s> Jack, please go away. Please go away.
<s> Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
<s> You must believe me.
<s> The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
<s> What about the zoo?
<s> Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
<s> Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
<s> Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
<s> I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
<s> Where do you think I've been?  I took the baby for a stroll in the park.
<s> Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
<s> All right, let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank, let him do it. I don't want any part of it.
<s> I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
<s> What about?
<s> That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
<s> I can't? You just wait and see. If that run doesn't stop within the next hour, I'll shut the doors. You know what that means? The bank examiner will step in tomorrow. You'll be forced to liquidate. I'll insist upon it. The depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. What's left you gentlemen can have. But I'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
<s> Stand back, Inspector. Let me out of here, or I'll shoot you!
<s> Am I? Why, I - I don't know any reason why I should be, unless of course it's you . . .
<s> Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight!
<s> Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
<s> Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about you and Mrs. Dickson.
<s> You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
<s> Wait a minute.  How do you feel this morning?
<s> Hello, darling.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .
<s> Why, I don't know.
<s> All right. That's all.  Please, Matt.
<s> Good.  You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released.  And listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.
<s> So have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that make? You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they—
<s> Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
<s> Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
<s> Don't you think I know it?
<s> Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
<s> A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
<s> Oh, Charlie again.
<s> Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
<s> Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> What time was it, Mrs. Halligan?
<s> Huh?
<s> wasn't anywhere near this place—
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> I guess so.
<s> Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it.
<s> They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.
<s> Sometimes a wound will kill.
<s> Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
<s> You stay out of this, Bob.
<s> How?
<s> Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
<s> It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
<s> You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
<s> Tomorrow.
<s> You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
<s> He's been full of vinegar lately.
<s> You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!
<s> I think I recognize you.
<s> Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
<s> I got us through the War all right.
<s> Then let me run the show, General Lee.
<s> Strategically.
<s> All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk...
<s> Go home, Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.
<s> Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
<s> So we got a plan?
<s> I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
<s> Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
<s> What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.
<s> Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
<s> We're just fine, thank you, sir.
<s> We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
<s> I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
<s> You didn't want to farm?
<s> You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
<s> Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm.
<s> Yes ma'am.
<s> Pity.
<s> I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
<s> Right here in church?
<s> This time we'll make an exception.
<s> Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
<s> Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
<s> I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
<s> Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
<s> No.
<s> Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
<s> Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
<s> Eight?
<s> Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
<s> Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
<s> Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
<s> Hi. Pat Bateman.
<s> Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
<s> Everybody has a great body now.
<s> It's not.
<s> But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
<s> Yes, I am.
<s> I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry.  You're just not terribly important to me.
<s> How did you guess?
<s> You saw the ad in the Times?
<s> Where are you going?
<s> I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus.
<s> But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
<s> I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
<s> Two at nine? Perfect.
<s> See you then.
<s> I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?
<s> Negative. Cancel it.
<s> Just...say...no.
<s> No, come on. Anywhere you want.
<s> You didn't give them a name.
<s> Jean? Hello? Jean?
<s> What do you think I do?
<s> No. Flattering, but no.
<s> That's...that's too bad.
<s> If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?
<s> You're at Paul Owen s.
<s> Does he do this all the time?
<s> Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
<s> Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
<s> It's no problem
<s> No, I guess it's okay.
<s> Hang...out?
<s> I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.
<s> Well, maybe he did, huh?
<s> But...has anyone seen him in London?
<s> Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
<s> Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
<s> I'm not...
<s> Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
<s> Cecelia is, well...you know 
<s> Then you've gotta ask him about that.
<s> No way. You have this -- destiny.
<s> Milo! What about --?
<s> What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
<s> It was a hate crime.
<s> "Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
<s> Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
<s> ...Different?
<s> Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle.  To tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything from you...
<s> He has thousands of employees, Milo --
<s> Milo, you --
<s> Don't we have any chopsticks?
<s> Right... What's that mean again?
<s> 'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
<s> Gimme the coordinates?
<s> He's working backwards, too.  Let's do number five?
<s> Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
<s> Oh hi.
<s> Okay. I'm Gary.
<s> Take a look at this. Slightly different approach.
<s> Were the flags for Teddy?
<s> Talk about work? Never!
<s> Oh. Yeah.
<s> The wrong place?
<s> ...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
<s> ...Worse?
<s> Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
<s> Let's go.
<s> Any irregularity in the pattern.
<s> I'm calling Gary.
<s> You're famous around here.
<s> We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
<s> Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
<s> Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
<s> You're compulsive.
<s> The Day Care?
<s> There's always a logical answer -- you just have to define the question.
<s> Certainly not at my happy home.
<s> What?
<s> Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
<s> Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
<s> That's lame, isn't it?
<s> Uh. Not exactly.
<s> What d'you mean?
<s> What does that mean?
<s> I've got a girlfriend, remember?
<s> You wanna survive in the software business, you cover your bets... I gotta say, this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested.
<s> Speaking of which...
<s> Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
<s> Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
<s> Where is he?
<s> What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
<s> Or sometimes not at all.
<s> Sak-i it to me!
<s> Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
<s> Hey, how are you?
<s> If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
<s> Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
<s> The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
<s> Yes?
<s> Oh, and Austin...
<s> Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
<s> Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
<s> I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
<s> We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
<s> Sure.
<s> What?
<s> I'm sure.
<s> Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
<s> You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
<s> Of course, luv.
<s> Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
<s> I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
<s> Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case.
<s> No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
<s> Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
<s> Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her-- I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!--
<s> I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
<s> Are you crazy?
<s> That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
<s> I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
<s> Here, have a piece of gum.
<s> Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
<s> It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
<s> Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
<s> Sea bass.
<s> That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
<s> I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
<s> Blow me.
<s> I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
<s> Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
<s> All right then...  ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
<s> You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
<s> Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.
<s> I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
<s> OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
<s> Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
<s> ... head ...
<s> Have we met?
<s> The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
<s> I'm already married ...
<s> Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
<s> So what was all this -- some sort of test?
<s> Thank you, Trubshaw ...
<s> A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
<s> After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea?
<s> I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
<s> Is there anything that isn't?
<s> According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.
<s> I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
<s> Orders.
<s> ... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.
<s> I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
<s> After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
<s> You don't trust me?
<s> You lied.
<s> No idea who. No idea why ...
<s> Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
<s> You first.
<s> Snuff.  I must insist you try some.
<s> '... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
<s> Still a bit chilly ...
<s> I see.
<s> Peter's brother?  But --
<s> I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
<s> It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
<s> Possibly. Split personality ...
<s> She may try to kill you.
<s> Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb.
<s> I feel sure of it.
<s> This way ...
<s> You wish.
<s> Bobbie, what are you talking about?
<s> I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
<s> Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
<s> Hey, man, congratulations!
<s> Maybe it had something to do.
<s> Mr. Thomerson.
<s> Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
<s> Sure have...
<s> I've tried to change her mind.
<s> But how can I do that?
<s> Keep me informed.
<s> What's the matter?
<s> I am committed. I love you.
<s> A real turd.
<s> They'll be up there in a half hour.
<s> Because I love her. What can I tell you?
<s> What's going on?
<s> Rick, I really think I'm in love.
<s> You're a pimp?
<s> I want women.
<s> I couldn't find any razor blades.
<s> It's Bullwinkle.
<s> Can't I just maim it a little?
<s> First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...
<s> The phone made me do it!
<s> Of course.
<s> And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
<s> Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
<s> You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
<s> Let me take the lead, Stephen...
<s> Stevie... I...
<s> John, when you're in there... in the fire... do you ever see...
<s> -- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --
<s> I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
<s> What, you've never seen one before?
<s> Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
<s> I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
<s> -- C'mon, Stephen.
<s> Hey.
<s> What, are you kidding? By myself?
<s> Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
<s> -- I tried, y'know? Helen's right. I don't have all the answers, but goddamn it, I've got some.  Look, you're gonna do what you have to, and maybe I shouldn't have gotten in the way. I'm your brother, not your father. Go on. You gotta go somewhere? Go...
<s> I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
<s> -- What are you doing here?
<s> I know.
<s> So now you suddenly care about my future?
<s> ...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
<s> Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
<s> Do you miss it?  You seem like you do.
<s> -- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
<s> -- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
<s> Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
<s> I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
<s> Trychticholorate.
<s> Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
<s> "Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
<s> But the right guess on this is arson.
<s> But he killed these guys.
<s> No.
<s> And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
<s> -- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
<s> Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
<s> This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
<s> Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.
<s> Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
<s> Okay.
<s> Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
<s> I know you.
<s> I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
<s> I might.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Me?
<s> You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
<s> I forgive you.
<s> All right, cop. I want my money.
<s> Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!
<s> Yeah, sucker. You better be there!
<s> I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
<s> That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
<s> You're a fucking joke, you know that?  He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!
<s> Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
<s> What case?
<s> Sister, we all know what happened to you yesterday morning. I expected that you would want to speak to me about it. But you could have come to my office. Your being here, in the confessional, implies that you, Sister, have done something wrong. You haven't. I assure you. I feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt. If you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of... curiosity or even... pleasure, you mustn't --
<s> Yes, Sister?
<s> I didn't mean to scare you like that.
<s> Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
<s> There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
<s> Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
<s> How much?
<s> And I'm the feet.
<s> To what?
<s> I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
<s> What are there character traits?
<s> Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much.
<s> Dunwitty, don't leave.
<s> The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.
<s> Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
<s> This is Cheeba.
<s> I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
<s> My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
<s> I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
<s> A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
<s> I thought it was appropiate.
<s> To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
<s> You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
<s> Give me the gun.
<s> I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
<s> I don't believe it.
<s> Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
<s> Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
<s> C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
<s> If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
<s> Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
<s> Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
<s> We all stick to this, it's smooth sailing.
<s> You've never had any formal training, either?
<s> You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
<s> Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
<s> And this is my very best friend Mantan.
<s> ...the big apple, New York, New York.
<s> Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
<s> ...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
<s> I thought you got rid of...
<s> ...too late, maybe around...
<s> Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
<s> Just ask me what you want to know.
<s> Why don't you answer?
<s> If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.
<s> Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
<s> The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
<s> But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
<s> Is Miss Dugan well?
<s> Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
<s> I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
<s> Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
<s> Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
<s> How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
<s> By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.
<s> Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.
<s> We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?"
<s> Then you must get it.
<s> I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
<s> Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
<s> I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
<s> Well, sir, this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of His Majesty's closet, and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy.  I should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the Viscounty which you propose to get.
<s> What is to be done?
<s> Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
<s> Yes, of course.
<s> Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
<s> Is he all right, papa?
<s> Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
<s> Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.
<s> Would you have me spend my life all alone?
<s> Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
<s> Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.
<s> Can anybody hear me!
<s> C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
<s> Did Kendall tell you about the PX?
<s> They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
<s> Jesus!
<s> One went off, yeah, but it didn't touch him -- I thought you knew this --
<s> Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.
<s> We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
<s> How do you know that?
<s> Why?
<s> We just want to check your pack --
<s> If not you, then who?
<s> No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
<s> Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.
<s> Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
<s> I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.
<s> I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.
<s> My heart weeps.
<s> Well?
<s> I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.
<s> I didn't do anything --
<s> Maybe --
<s> I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
<s> I'm not gonna let that happen.
<s> Who killed Pike?
<s> Or what? You've gone round the bend --
<s> That is the most unprofessional --
<s> What point?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
<s> And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
<s> Good idea.
<s> This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
<s> He whispered it in my ear.
<s> Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning --
<s> You can't threaten me --
<s> Childs.
<s> I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
<s> Sir, yes, sir!
<s> It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
<s> That's great.
<s> I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
<s> Who is she? Where does she live?
<s> Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.
<s> My father and I have an advantage. We never talk.
<s> Eighteen.
<s> I'm not convinced you should be happy.
<s> Go.
<s> You're lucky to get four words out of them in English. But if you were to walk through the jungle, you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French. Those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
<s> Can I take your picture?
<s> Oh, so this is a tall tale?
<s> I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?
<s> I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
<s> Like this.
<s> But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
<s> I called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way I could get my wife to marry me.
<s> I have the rest of my life to find out.
<s> Probably tonight.
<s> That's because most of it never happened.
<s> Of course.
<s> Yes.
<s> Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.
<s> He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
<s> Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
<s> No I don't.
<s> I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
<s> There's over eighty thousand here.
<s> Do you want to stop?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Name it.
<s> No I haven't.
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
<s> Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
<s> You can stay tonight.
<s> John.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
<s> But, you know, so what?
<s> He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
<s> Why not?
<s> Sometimes.
<s> Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
<s> Get out.
<s> Please, there's no... Oh.
<s> I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.
<s> I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
<s> What was her name?
<s> No. I think I better just go.
<s> You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> It's not mine either.
<s> It's more like a date.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.
<s> Well. Hope you enjoy it.
<s> You gonna sing me somethin'?
<s> Now wait...
<s> Your mother's funeral. I's a pallbearer, remember?
<s> Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?
<s> Let go of my arm...
<s> I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...
<s> In my house, you watch that lip...
<s> Can't sit all day on that sofa. Need to get your legs strong.
<s> I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
<s> You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
<s> Yeah, gal I been here before.
<s> You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
<s> This Rae... you get with her?
<s> You gotta go, R.L.. I ain't foolin' this time.
<s> Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
<s> Not like that.
<s> I do.
<s> Yes'sir.
<s> You could put it that way.
<s> Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel.
<s> All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...
<s> All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.
<s> You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
<s> So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
<s> It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
<s> Saving your life.
<s> Not a prayer.
<s> No.
<s> You said that in the last two places.
<s> Cool?
<s> Yeah... I came to save you.  If you're hopeless, I'll pull the plug.
<s> I wasn't expecting you.
<s> They made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.
<s> Why weren't you at the platform?
<s> Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
<s> You were too far behind.
<s> Shut-up.
<s> I want to yank Kobo.
<s> Big enough.
<s> Let's go.  Him first.
<s> We can't lose.
<s> He's on duty.
<s> You met her.
<s> I don't remember you saying no.
<s> Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
<s> Not in that company.
<s> He was my partner.
<s> The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
<s> Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.
<s> It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
<s> Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
<s> Also extraordinary things.
<s> Of course not.
<s> Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece.
<s> She's not with you?
<s> Got it.
<s> Why, yes, of course.
<s> And what in your estimation works?
<s> Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
<s> Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.
<s> It's okay.  Forget it.
<s> Shot of vodka, please.
<s> Prosit.
<s> Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.
<s> Four years.
<s> I'm doing okay.
<s> I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes.
<s> No rust?
<s> True.
<s> They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
<s> Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.
<s> I bet I would.
<s> A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
<s> Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
<s> You did?
<s> If they are smart, they take naps.
<s> Like?
<s> You mean a woman?
<s> What's up?
<s> Memory implant.  She was programmed. But I think she has transcended her conditioning.  I think she was beginning to suspect.
<s> Five, maybe six.
<s> I mean you're not helping! Why is that, Leon?
<s> What's that?
<s> Yes?
<s> I'm Adam Webber.
<s> She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
<s> Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
<s> Come where?
<s> I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
<s> I just had a mental picture of...
<s> Yes, I'm right?
<s> I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked!
<s> Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
<s> Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
<s> No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
<s> Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
<s> What for?
<s> The big one!
<s> Two weeks.
<s> I told you I've never driven before!
<s> He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
<s> But, Eve, I would--
<s> Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour.
<s> And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
<s> Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
<s> Could I please just go home?  I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again.
<s> What?
<s> Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
<s> Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
<s> Your mom made that all by herself.
<s> Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
<s> I've never met anyone like you in my life.
<s> Russia.
<s> True.
<s> I see.  Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice.
<s> Thirty-five.
<s> The sky!!!
<s> Just look!!
<s> Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
<s> Good!
<s> Well, we're here to help!
<s> Oh, you got a problem with that?
<s> I'll be all right.
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
<s> And now you must let me be the judge of that!
<s> Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> All our friends...
<s> Honey?
<s> No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
<s> What?
<s> You bet.
<s> We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
<s> Well, I am the head of this household--
<s> Some time.
<s> Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
<s> I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
<s> From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
<s> Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
<s> Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
<s> Um...uh...
<s> No, I'm just going to walk around the neighborhood. Don't worry.
<s> Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
<s> Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
<s> Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
<s> Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
<s> I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
<s> Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
<s> Well.
<s> Same here.
<s> There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
<s> Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
<s> I sure don't hate you.
<s> Sure I do.
<s> I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
<s> Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
<s> Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
<s> Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
<s> No thanks. What does that mean?
<s> FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
<s> Okay Frank.
<s> Yeah, I know.
<s> Maybe so.
<s> Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
<s> Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
<s> Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
<s> Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
<s> Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
<s> Are you sure?
<s> I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
<s> He got a little jealous.
<s> That doesn't bother you, does it?
<s> Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
<s> Goodnight.
<s> I'm really sorry.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> No Jeffrey!!
<s> Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
<s> Yes mother.
<s> I can't find the second one, sir.
<s> Let's do him right here.
<s> This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
<s> Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing.
<s> BLAME...
<s> What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
<s> Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
<s> Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
<s> A bit.
<s> Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
<s> Aye.
<s> He's a good man.
<s> Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
<s> Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.
<s> Can she I.D. them?
<s> My, my...
<s> What?
<s> Twist of lemon!
<s> Sweet-n-low!
<s> Eight.
<s> We promise.
<s> What the fuck do you mean?
<s> We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
<s> Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
<s> What do you want me to say?
<s> Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
<s> Dignan, it's --
<s> See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be --
<s> What do you think the cops have?
<s> Yeah.
<s> We got it. We got it.
<s> Don't even say it, man.
<s> They obviously weren't designed for racing.
<s> No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
<s> Bob?
<s> OK.
<s> Would of been nice.
<s> Don't panic, Anthony.
<s> I know.
<s> What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
<s> What the fuck are we doing out here?
<s> I did.
<s> Take your second position.
<s> Careful. Check his pulse.
<s> Applejack's stuck in the elevator?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Behind Bob's house.
<s> What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.
<s> He stole a tractor.
<s> It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this.
<s> Grammar.
<s> I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
<s> That sounds like Dignan.
<s> No. Bob did.
<s> It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
<s> Let them fight.
<s> Move.
<s> OK, Dad.
<s> I'm not playing any more golf.
<s> Hopscotch. The code name is hopscotch.
<s> No.
<s> I didn't do anything.
<s> Temporarily.
<s> You're Anthony?
<s> Uh-uh.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> What's he doing here?
<s> Well, this isn't really a party per se.
<s> It's true, Dignan.
<s> I'll just drive my car.
<s> You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.
<s> Well, don't blame me. I told you.
<s> That's your domain.
<s> I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
<s> That's too bad.
<s> No. I was calm.
<s> But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
<s> You don't even know his name.
<s> Stand by. Bird Dog?
<s> Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
<s> I didn't think there was an alarm.
<s> What's that?
<s> Here we go.
<s> I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
<s> Well, I think --
<s> Who? Applejack?
<s> Can't get it. It won't... 
<s> ...this is Conklin's computer.
<s> Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?
<s> Thanks.
<s> The sooner the better.
<s> Keep going...
<s> Okay... 
<s> Then what?
<s> I can't let you do that either.
<s> Felt a little light.
<s> Conklin up front.
<s> No. There's nothing new.
<s> The Telegraph office.
<s> He was at the campground yesterday.
<s> It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
<s> Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
<s> What if it's not who you think it is?
<s> There must be another way!
<s> Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
<s> Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
<s> I want someone I know to take me in.
<s> There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.
<s> Ramstein Air Base, Germany.  Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital.
<s> What's that?
<s> Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
<s> And the Germans can't match it?
<s> Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
<s> But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
<s> That's where we came out.
<s> I don't want to leave.
<s> My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
<s> You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
<s> Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
<s> Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
<s> Wallace's followers.
<s> Grant, as you do everything else, with treachery. Offer him a truce to discuss terms, and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. He trusts me. Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along. And I will set the meeting, and the ambush.
<s> Wallace's? For treason there is no trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, then executed.
<s> Hamish, I... thank...
<s> Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
<s> Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
<s> With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
<s> Aye, we'll get 'em.
<s> This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
<s> Yes, you are. And you must wake.
<s> And I with you. But you must wake.
<s> Wake up, William. Wake up!
<s> How do you know this?
<s> I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
<s> Every man dies. Not every man really lives.
<s> It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
<s> And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
<s> Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I.
<s> When I asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it.
<s> Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
<s> But you must have something to go on?
<s> Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.
<s> Okay.
<s> What? What could he do?
<s> Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
<s> You need to see the prison shrink, man.
<s> Weirder than this?
<s> Yes.
<s> I see a car.
<s> That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart.
<s> Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
<s> So let's go. This place creeps me out.
<s> He must be. They're letting him go, right?
<s> Hi, Lenny.
<s> Wow. That must've taken some courage.
<s> Me? Are you kidding? Why?
<s> Of course.
<s> What do you want to know, Evan?
<s> Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
<s> So it didn't feel... weird?
<s> Go on. Sit down.
<s> Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
<s> I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
<s> We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
<s> Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
<s> ...yes.
<s> But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.
<s> I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
<s> Gee, thanks friend.
<s> Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke.
<s> I think I'll go check out the chapel.
<s> I thought I was the bad guy!
<s> Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
<s> Oh my God oh my God...
<s> What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
<s> As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.
<s> How long can I afford to stay closed?
<s> -- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
<s> It has been a pleasure to meet you.
<s> Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
<s> And the carrying charges?
<s> Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
<s> I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
<s> You needn't be concerned about me.
<s> What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
<s> No.
<s> And I was wondering.
<s> I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
<s> I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor.
<s> It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
<s> I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
<s> Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
<s> It doesn't matter.
<s> I don't think I will, Rick.
<s> You can believe that if you want to.
<s> Please.
<s> No.
<s> If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you.
<s> Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
<s> I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
<s> And I said I would never leave you.
<s> Goodnight.
<s> Apparently he has the letters.
<s> I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
<s> -- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.
<s> Sam?
<s> He came from Paris with Rick.
<s> I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --
<s> You're saying this only to make me go.
<s> Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
<s> I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
<s> There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
<s> Yes. What is it you want?
<s> I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
<s> I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.
<s> Thank you.
<s> I expected no less, Captain.
<s> How do you do, Mr. Rick?
<s> I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
<s> Perhaps.
<s> But we mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they "blundered" into Berlin in 1918.
<s> I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
<s> Ask Monsieur Rick.
<s> And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
<s> Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
<s> Perhaps not.
<s> His escape.
<s> Okay.
<s> Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
<s> Put that phone down!
<s> I don't want them here overnight.
<s> Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Well, I don't think I can remember it.
<s> Yes, boss.
<s> You've had today's water.
<s> You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
<s> Fix raft first.
<s> Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse.
<s> Look again, asshole.  It's a mirage.
<s> Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.
<s> There was an unavoidable delay.
<s> Okay.  Sure.
<s> Well, I do a little drawing --
<s> I had it on the island with me.
<s> Cold.
<s> You want to.
<s> I can't take him to work.
<s> No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --
<s> I would have done the same thing.
<s> Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
<s> Well, when that IV runs out, you're through with us.  Just the dentist tomorrow.
<s> You bet I do.  High tide comes right up to this road.
<s> Let's eat.
<s> There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
<s> Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us?
<s> Can you find her?
<s> It was fifteen minutes late.
<s> But I might not have.
<s> Take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx, that's women, that's life.
<s> Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
<s> I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing.
<s> Hallelujah.
<s> Permission granted.
<s> Life is waiting.
<s> He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
<s> It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
<s> Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
<s> I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
<s> I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find *them*.
<s> I know.
<s> I don't know. She got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she?
<s> Good night, Daddy.
<s> Daddy, *please*...
<s> Really?
<s> Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?
<s> Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.
<s> I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
<s> Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
<s> I'm not trying to be anything--I'm just doing nothing! If I wait and see long enough, then--with any luck-- I won't *ever* have to make up my mind! Decisions can be painful, after all...
<s> No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you.
<s> Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
<s> Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places...
<s> No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
<s> Well, they aren't.
<s> Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!
<s> I love you, too. See you tomorrow.
<s> Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
<s> Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
<s> Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
<s> Someone not from Maine.
<s> I don't remember.
<s> A B-24 Liberator.
<s> Actually, I volunteered.
<s> What about the trees?
<s> It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
<s> Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
<s> Not yet. What do you know about it?
<s> *Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
<s> Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
<s> It look nicer then home!
<s> Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
<s> That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too. Ain't that right?
<s> I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.
<s> Uh, Maker's Mark. Rocks.
<s> Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
<s> It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
<s> That's right. So, brainiacs that we are, we thought we'd be innovative and relocate east. Try our luck with a straight corporate loan out here.
<s> Sort of like a letter of intent.
<s> Everything looks in order.
<s> I know. It won't go unnoticed.
<s> The standard ten.
<s> Two million.
<s> What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
<s> Just the last three weeks.
<s> Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.
<s> Having a gun pointed at you for one. It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. Three on a match, black cats... Believe it. Believe it all.
<s> My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million.
<s> It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.
<s> You're pissed we didn't get credit?
<s> I just don't know if this says, "me". What's the fabric?
<s> How's that? He works for Gillette.
<s> No, not "whatever." You're either in or you're out.
<s> She's up for it.
<s> You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
<s> We got caught. So you know it won't happen again.
<s> All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.
<s> You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me.
<s> What?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Don't ruin this for me.
<s> Sounds respectable.
<s> You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now?
<s> We never had a problem with that before.
<s> What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
<s> And we got rid of the red head.
<s> Jake? Customs?
<s> That's what I like about you, Lupus. You're a free thinker. Don't let the King tell you different.
<s> It's not history.
<s> You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
<s> I try.
<s> What are we gonna do with this stuff anyway? Heroin? What the hell do you do with heroin?
<s> We're here.
<s> Whoa, whoa... There he is.
<s> I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
<s> It's the tension.
<s> I can imagine.
<s> Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
<s> You mean I won't resist them.
<s> It's not just inner beauty, is it?
<s> You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.
<s> There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
<s> Fine.
<s> I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
<s> -- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
<s> It's the truth.
<s> I hope it brings you luck.
<s> Never. Why do you ask?
<s> That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
<s> Your father?
<s> Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology.
<s> I don't gamble.
<s> Just an accident. Nothing.
<s> Then you're not a pro.
<s> Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
<s> Well, life's not fair. We know that.
<s> Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
<s> Over the river.
<s> You've done pretty well.
<s> I'd like to buy you a drink.
<s> Any exceptions?
<s> Five.
<s> I don't gamble.
<s> Fine.
<s> Does he win?
<s> I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
<s> I hope it's not the oven again.
<s> I think he's talking to it.
<s> Oh, God...
<s> Time to start talking.
<s> He just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
<s> Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
<s> Huh?
<s> Bomb?
<s> I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
<s> I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
<s> Intuition is no proof. What concrete evidence do you have of your own existence?
<s> That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
<s> In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
<s> Of course not.
<s> I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
<s> Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?
<s> Any of 'em any good?
<s> Who cares. Don't bother me.
<s> Commander Powell is dead.
<s> -- Remark.
<s> Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it?
<s> ...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
<s> Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
<s> I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
<s> Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
<s> Yeah.
<s> How I make my living, what's your point?
<s> Now that that's out of the way... You want the woman, here's how it works.  You pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever, and I make a call to bring her in.
<s> Yeah, sure, I understand.
<s> Sooo...whattya think?  Maybe after I betray the woman who trusts me and you take her and her daughter out and execute them...we could go on a date.  Play a little miniature golf or somethin'.
<s> What're you talkin' about?
<s> No.
<s> Justine was not an unwilling participant.
<s> And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
<s> I'm really glad we're having this conversation.  You're right.  I was angry at you.  But talking about it-- The scales have fallen from my eyes and I see now that it was all my fault.  Can you ever forgive me?
<s> What?  Where're we going?
<s> It's a rule.
<s> Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
<s> We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
<s> Then how come last night I heard you talking to Logan and you were crying?
<s> Mommy, I'm scared.
<s> Girl's gotta make a living.
<s> Logan Cale.
<s> Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
<s> I won't be staying.
<s> A girl.
<s> You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
<s> Look, thank you for this but--
<s> You don't want to.
<s> Can't help you.
<s> With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
<s> I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
<s> You did.
<s> Only a last name would be nice.  Or the nearest town to this...clinic.
<s> You're crazy.
<s> No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?
<s> What?
<s> Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
<s> Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
<s> You're the best, Maxie.
<s> Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
<s> Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
<s> I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
<s> Hawk.
<s> You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
<s> Whatever... stella.
<s> One more time in English.
<s> Check!
<s> Still too risky for my money.  We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection...
<s> Sure.
<s> It's my Bullworker.
<s> I'm really sorry about that, man.
<s> Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
<s> Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels.
<s> See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
<s> Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
<s> Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
<s> That's it?
<s> Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?
<s> Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
<s> Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie.
<s> Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.
<s> Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!
<s> Let's lift up her shirt.
<s> Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.
<s> The KISS Army!
<s> Neither do I!
<s> Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
<s> So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
<s> Like a spear.
<s> If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
<s> Not until like... eighth grade.
<s> You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
<s> I can do anything I want... and so can you...
<s> I am so sorry.
<s> Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
<s> Hey...
<s> Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
<s> You mean soap?
<s> Will you go with me?
<s> So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
<s> She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?
<s> Where are we going?
<s> You know, Roberta Sparrow. We almost hit her with the car the other day.
<s> I know, Dad.
<s> Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
<s> I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
<s> I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
<s> I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
<s> I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
<s> It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
<s> The good stuff.
<s> What did you want for Christmas that year?
<s> What else makes you feel regret?
<s> If God exists?
<s> Frank is going to kill.
<s> Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts...  Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear.
<s> The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour.
<s> Go back to China, bitch!
<s> She's right over there.
<s> I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
<s> My mom wanted me to have this?
<s> Well, your "cheap whore" is this family's "lovin' mother."  The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and...
<s> No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.
<s> They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
<s> I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
<s> Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
<s> Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
<s> Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.
<s> Yes, Leslie!
<s> Yah-sure, fine... fine.
<s> Loretta, shut it.
<s> Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
<s> I got a hairdo.
<s> So? Be real easy.
<s> It smells funny. Like gasoline.
<s> Last year? It was, "Buy American."
<s> You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!
<s> Yeah.
<s> Tina! Tina!! TINA!!!
<s> And everything.  He should be king!
<s> The king can do no wrong! 
<s> "My dear"...
<s> "My dear"...
<s> About - thirty-four seconds.
<s> Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
<s> I don't want him.
<s> Did you shoot the rapids?
<s> Well, maybe he's still the vice- president.  Now if I were to offer you --
<s> Then you don't wanna work hard?
<s> That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
<s> All right -- I'll go out and find one.
<s> I can't do it right away.
<s> You upstart!
<s> Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
<s> Yes please, two.
<s> I've always thought that myself.
<s> Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
<s> Well, these things take time.
<s> Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
<s> I'll get my bag.
<s> Just a moment, how did you get in here?
<s> So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
<s> He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.
<s> ...Yes, Sir.
<s> Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
<s> I don't know what I've got.
<s> Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
<s> Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother.
<s> That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...
<s> No, but I certainly shall.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
<s> Yyyess.
<s> Say "Mmmerrick."
<s> Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
<s> You did not ask me.
<s> I thought as much.
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh no, I couldn't.
<s> You too, my friend. Goodnight.
<s> Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
<s> You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
<s> There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
<s> You're losing your temper!
<s> Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
<s> Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
<s> These? What are THESE? They're swords.
<s> We never went to bed together.
<s> You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
<s> "The fifth one this week"!
<s> And the week before that?
<s> I'll bring it back.
<s> It was my master Keitel's idea.
<s> What d'you mean?
<s> I shouldn't have come.
<s> I see the world.
<s> Well, how d'you think I feel?
<s> I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.
<s> You don't love ME.
<s> What?
<s> Ah.
<s> Aaagh! Rape!
<s> You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
<s> I don't know! I just did!
<s> Come on, move it!
<s> It saved my father!
<s> I know. I know.
<s> Well, you ARE!
<s> Sorry.
<s> You may need a real Berserk.
<s> Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
<s> ROW!
<s> The sun! That's it!
<s> Look out!
<s> So?
<s> Well, come on!
<s> To the oars!
<s> Do what?
<s> He hasn't.
<s> No, it is NOT.
<s> No, I'm not.
<s> Mum! Dad!
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
<s> Hang on...
<s> She knows it was our fault!
<s> No! It's YOU, Loki! I should never have listened to you!
<s> DEATH TO DRAGONS!
<s> Easy, Dad!
<s> Me too.
<s> I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!
<s> Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name?
<s> You were not.
<s> I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
<s> Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
<s> It's gorgeous.  Just my taste. I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked.  Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.
<s> Why?
<s> Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
<s> My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
<s> I'm not nuts.
<s> Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
<s> That's okay.
<s> Sort of, um...
<s> Well, I wouldn't want to be --
<s> Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
<s> Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
<s> No, I'm okay for now.
<s> You pick it.
<s> Yeah, I guess.
<s> Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
<s> Sounds good. But right now I should go.
<s> Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
<s> You didn't say anything about my hair.
<s> You're not ready.
<s> Hi.
<s> And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
<s> I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
<s> I don't think I've slept in a year.
<s> Okay.
<s> What are you doing?
<s> Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
<s> Yeah.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
<s> I guess so.
<s> Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
<s> I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
<s> You have to stop this!
<s> I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
<s> Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.
<s> I miss you.
<s> Hi, Mary. How's it going?
<s> Very cool. Trippy.
<s> You found us okay?
<s> You love him, don't you?
<s> I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
<s> Cole slaw, ice tea?
<s> No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.
<s> I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility.
<s> She came to help, Howard.
<s> Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
<s> I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
<s> Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
<s> Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
<s> Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
<s> Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
<s> You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.
<s> Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
<s> Getting dressed. I've got to go.
<s> I was a successful model once.
<s> Yep.
<s> Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.
<s> I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
<s> It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
<s> You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
<s> No, thank you.
<s> Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible...
<s> I'm telling you, I saw it...
<s> It is not.
<s> I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...
<s> Run!
<s> Trauma.
<s> I've been listening to the transmission. And I think Houston made a mistake in the translation.
<s> "Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
<s> Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
<s> Oh God...
<s> Start the countdown.
<s> Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
<s> I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
<s> What you got, Peters?
<s> ...how's the client?
<s> Skipper...
<s> Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
<s> Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --
<s> I DON'T KNOW!  I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't understand. Truth takes time.
<s> We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  Fuck this ship.
<s> You're lying...!
<s> ...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
<s> Where is it?
<s> We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.
<s> That's enough!
<s> Come again, Skipper?
<s> Keep your eyes open.
<s> We can take the filters from the Clark...
<s> What is it, Starck?
<s> Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
<s> Five seconds.
<s> Can you shut it down?
<s> Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna need a rubber...
<s> That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.
<s> All boards are green, everything's five by five.
<s> Picking up magnetic interference.
<s> Explosive decompression.
<s> How?
<s> Do they have pressure?
<s> If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense.
<s> I can't believe we built this.
<s> It wants me. I have to go.
<s> Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?
<s> Out front? You home, baby? I got a surprise for you.
<s> Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
<s> Five times.
<s> Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
<s> Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
<s> Go back to the drawing board.
<s> Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
<s> Ben, are you there?
<s> What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
<s> I can go hotter!
<s> What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
<s> Johnny.
<s> That's the temperature of the sun.
<s> Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
<s> Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...
<s> I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
<s> Anger. Rage. Frustration.
<s> No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does.
<s> And reverse the mutations --
<s> He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
<s> You were?
<s> The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents.
<s> Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
<s> I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
<s> Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
<s> Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
<s> Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
<s> Susan. What are you doing?
<s> Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
<s> You want to work at Carl's?
<s> I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
<s> Of course.
<s> No. I want my money back right now.
<s> U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
<s> They're not home yet.
<s> I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom.
<s> I didn't say that.
<s> Maybe yes. Maybe no.
<s> It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
<s> But they weren't mine.
<s> Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
<s> Dad says!
<s> Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you.
<s> Nice to meet you.
<s> Oh, really?
<s> What a guy.
<s> Mark is a really nice boy...
<s> I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
<s> I know it's yours.
<s> Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
<s> She's in my biology class.
<s> Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
<s> What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
<s> I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
<s> That's me, Merv.
<s> Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
<s> Do you think that guy's cute?
<s> Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.
<s> He was hot, wasn't he?
<s> Believe it.
<s> There's nothing to it.
<s> Oh! That's where that group got its name from.
<s> He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.
<s> What do you think it is?
<s> Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!
<s> What do you want?
<s> Well I might go to Dartmouth.
<s> Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
<s> Yeah. She is pretty good.
<s> No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
<s> It's John Bonham's birthday.
<s> I'd like that.
<s> I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
<s> He is. Don't worry, I'll get it to him.
<s> Awake? What do you mean?
<s> Not for me.
<s> IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
<s> Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
<s> What?
<s> One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats.
<s> The medicine? Yes, it's right here.
<s> No, no. Don't leave me!
<s> Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.
<s> Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
<s> Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
<s> Not much. Why?
<s> GO?
<s> Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
<s> Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
<s> Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.
<s> Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
<s> I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
<s> We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in.
<s> It's gone too far.
<s> Right!
<s> Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!
<s> I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention. I swear! All I wanted to do was clean up the room. I don't know anything about dope!
<s> No! I swear I'm not!
<s> Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
<s> A nap won't help. I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights. I can't even remember. If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours.
<s> What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
<s> I'm telling you, I don't see a thing --
<s> Where's that?
<s> And the head?
<s> What!? I'm not going down there again!
<s> This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
<s> He's dead.
<s> Oh.
<s> It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
<s> The girl's got rhythm.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Seven.
<s> What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
<s> What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down, Cocoon.
<s> Hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do?
<s> Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
<s> MOVE YOUR ASS!
<s> HELLLLLLLLP!!
<s> BONSAI!
<s> Amazing you made it this far.
<s> That's fine.
<s> Um, well...
<s> Well...
<s> I just hit it like you said.
<s> This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
<s> Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
<s> God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!
<s> Who is she?
<s> I know, but --
<s> Showdown.
<s> Dick, we need some time apart --
<s> Dick, I can't even breathe here...
<s> I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her.  Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing.
<s> I gotta go now.
<s> See you next weekend, Dad.
<s> I know.
<s> Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
<s> Please, Francie...
<s> I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
<s> Oh Angela, my own... Angela!
<s> Fifteen.
<s> No, I don't hate it.
<s> Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.
<s> Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.
<s> What happened to him?
<s> Kaminski.
<s> They killed him. They threw him out that window.
<s> He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done.  Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job.  I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman.  How d'ya like the camouflage?
<s> Yeah.
<s> I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
<s> I know.
<s> Frances...
<s> Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
<s> Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
<s> No, Harry, I can't -- 
<s> That sure looks like fun...  You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
<s> That's right.
<s> ...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.
<s> Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
<s> Yes.
<s> I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
<s> Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you.
<s> Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy.
<s> Not long.
<s> Yes, Mama.
<s> You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
<s> Yes. It was very good to see her.
<s> Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.
<s> You're kidding.
<s> What?
<s> You drove him to his torment.
<s> Yes. Very close
<s> Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
<s> How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
<s> A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
<s> Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
<s> Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. We'll say it came today. It'll set his mind at ease.
<s> He set things right with a proper apology... and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab!
<s> It's far too late for him to still be out.
<s> I'll have to do better than that.
<s> Only you.
<s> If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
<s> Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
<s> Now husband and wife.
<s> Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
<s> As a march hare.
<s> But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions.
<s> I've been preoccupied.
<s> Is that your diagnosis?
<s> Let it go.
<s> And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken?  Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?
<s> Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
<s> Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
<s> Are you a physician?
<s> Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
<s> Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
<s> Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
<s> Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
<s> Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen. Annie.
<s> I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
<s> Almost five.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> Where'd you get that stuff?
<s> Is it stuck?
<s> I'll spot you five points.
<s> That was the telephone.
<s> Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
<s> I call it my shower dream.
<s> Lead the way!
<s> Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.
<s> One night on the town.
<s> Sure.
<s> Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are.
<s> You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.
<s> So let's do it.
<s> Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
<s> They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
<s> He's running the show.
<s> Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't do nothin' stupid.  You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!
<s> Come again?
<s> My wife.
<s> Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
<s> I was a minister.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.
<s> I swear to God I won't try to escape and I'll do my best to get you into Mexico.
<s> He's smilin' at us. But behind his smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack." I hear that loud and clear.
<s> To yours.
<s> Yeah, I know what's going on. We got a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and simple. And I don't wanna hear any bullshit about "I don't believe in vampires" because I don't fuckin' believe in vampires either. But I do believe in my own two fuckin' eyes, and with my two eyes I saw fuckin' vampires! Now, does everybody agree we're dealin' with vampires.
<s> I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
<s> Yep.
<s> That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
<s> Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
<s> What you said to me in the room.
<s> You asked me if I would --
<s> You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
<s> Get it and bring it up here, will ya, please?
<s> Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!
<s> Anytime.
<s> What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot?
<s> Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
<s> This bar is for bikers and truckers only.  You, get out!
<s> Seth, he did it. You were by the beer cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his face.  And I saw him mouth:
<s> How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.
<s> What?
<s> No, I didn't.
<s> Or what?
<s> Yeah, I think so. What happened?
<s> I did?
<s> Really?
<s> We are?
<s> That's what you look like.
<s> Where are you right now?
<s> Scarred for life, that's how I am!
<s> Actually, our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man.  He's a preacher.
<s> Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
<s> Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
<s> It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.
<s> It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.
<s> I think you've resented me from the start, sir.
<s> The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.
<s> So I'll get a fair shot?
<s> Sir...
<s> Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing.  They'll never know whose leak it is.
<s> California.
<s> This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
<s> Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered.  But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base.
<s> Absolutely not.
<s> I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.
<s> Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
<s> You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.
<s> No, ma'am.
<s> Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break in that line?
<s> Check your watch, Pyro.  Seems fast.
<s> Every class has its surprises, Pyro. This one'll be no different.
<s> Get it up!
<s> You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
<s> She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
<s> What "all females"?  If I'm the only --
<s> I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
<s> You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil.  Analyze.
<s> Just like you would be.
<s> Me?  Why me?
<s> Jordan.  You watch your ass.
<s> The Chief?  Or maybe even Turrentine?  Your C.O.?
<s> Intagliata was out chasing breakfast.  They found his tracks. Well, shit.
<s> They had to kill 'em?
<s> How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?
<s> This is insane.  You've got no proof.
<s> Maybe half.  Not even.
<s> It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore.
<s> For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
<s> It also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir.  So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead.
<s> "Dad."
<s> Should I be afraid?
<s> No.
<s> So am I.
<s> What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?
<s> O'Neil, Jordan.
<s> All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
<s> You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog.
<s> Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
<s> Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
<s> You must have quite some harem.
<s> Yeah, well...
<s> Most people don't.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.
<s> Oh, please, your life doesn't suck. His life sucks.
<s> That's the problem. He did.
<s> Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
<s> What's it to you?
<s> Five bucks.
<s> He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> That is when we will go in.
<s> Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
<s> You're fast.
<s> Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
<s> No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
<s> What are you suggesting?
<s> No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it.
<s> Are you sure? How do you know?
<s> Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
<s> I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong.
<s> I just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend.
<s> Thanks.
<s> ...Damn you!  Damn you!
<s> ...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
<s> I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
<s> The ships are gaining...
<s> There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it?
<s> It's okay. Listen-
<s> Okay, you can go on in... I'm going to get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive.
<s> Okay...  Okay, now what.
<s> Okay, now. But-
<s> Lt. Madison, GO.
<s> Yeah. What's wrong? JASON ~~othIno. I -ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat.
<s> We're getting major structural damage.
<s> The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
<s> No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
<s> All systems are working, Commander.
<s> So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
<s> Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls..
<s> Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.
<s> Oh I make it up. Use lots of "k"s and "v"s.
<s> We should have a turbo. I'm always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?...
<s> Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
<s> Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
<s> Not a clue. You?
<s> We made It. Commander, we made it.' m ALEXANDER sort ov) By Grabtnar' s h~mmer, we  ove to te   ono 'tale.
<s> Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
<s> I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
<s> Turn on the translation circuit.
<s> Because it was on the show!
<s> Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.
<s> Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
<s> Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer.
<s> Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
<s> Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
<s> Simpler.
<s> Catch me later, okay?
<s> Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on in, I'll get some pants on.
<s> Home.
<s> And determination.
<s> Wh... Where are we?
<s> Push It. Hold it down.
<s> The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.
<s> Get oacK on their tail.
<s> You seem pleased by the prospect.
<s> We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?
<s> While they're strung out?
<s> I'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.
<s> None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
<s> Yes, general?
<s> Yes, general.
<s> I, don't know what color is what officer, my lord...
<s> Lafayette will not be happy...
<s> To learn to shoot cannon?
<s> Get the body of our army up to Greene's vanguard as fast as we can.  All the damned fool has to do is hit the British rearguard and then hold for us.
<s> Colonel Hamilton.  Anyone who served under Arnold, I want them shipped north.  I don't want any troops here who served under Arnold.
<s> Don't lie to me, Hamilton!  If I had not court-martialed Arnold...
<s> No one knows...
<s> You're asking me to be president of a republic, not king?  Not a dictator over subjects?
<s> Yes, an astonishing power over weak minds.
<s> Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
<s> I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?
<s> I understand, George.
<s> A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
<s> To assert the rights of our founding fathers!  This country was colonized by Christians!  This shall become a Christian revolution.  Surely as a good Christian you understand that!
<s> They help me understand why we fight.
<s> We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
<s> I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
<s> Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
<s> My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
<s> But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
<s> My God, what?
<s> I think I heard that.
<s> Oh, indeed?  You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes!  They beg you to consider the future.  What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?
<s> You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
<s> I'm with Captain Hamilton.
<s> It is; we need you George.
<s> Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.
<s> I'd throw everything away for you.
<s> That's not what I said!  Now, Sally, you're embarrassing me!  Watch out for her, George; she talks refinement, but she has a barbarous soul!
<s> That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
<s> So where's the money?
<s> Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
<s> That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.
<s> Come here, Farrah...
<s> You're right.
<s> I have to ask you for that key.
<s> Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
<s> Not too bad.
<s> Your who?
<s> That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
<s> Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy.
<s> Who?
<s> What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
<s> What?
<s> I can't do it.
<s> You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
<s> Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
<s> It was waiting out there on another deal, one that didn't go through; one you don't want to know about.
<s> It's not the kind of thing you do.
<s> That's the magic number.
<s> Ray. Look at me.
<s> Look at me, Ray.
<s> That's correct. Look at me.
<s> 'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.
<s> He owes me money.
<s> That's right.
<s> I'm in the movie business.
<s> I'm a producer.
<s> You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
<s> That's right. As a matter of fact...
<s> You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
<s> Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.
<s> A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy".
<s> She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades.
<s> Hey, Harry.
<s> Get the fuck outta my chair.
<s> It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
<s> One of mine?
<s> With what? Wiseguy money?
<s> What happened? The pressure got to you?
<s> That's not bad.
<s> Yeah, I like it, I'm high up, I can see everything, you know? It's the Cadillac of minivans.
<s> How'd you know I was here?
<s> I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
<s> I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons –-
<s> He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
<s> Don't go out of your way.
<s> I just caught the end.
<s> Not yet.
<s> You don't like Martin much, do you?
<s> Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
<s> Oh.
<s> Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.
<s> Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.
<s> Go get your stuff.
<s> Couldn't find my toothbrush.
<s> That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
<s> You heard me, Pick 'n' Save.
<s> No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
<s> Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
<s> You don't? What happened to Muff?
<s> Harry -–
<s> Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
<s> Man's in town two days, thinks he's David O. fucking Selznick.
<s> Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.
<s> Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?
<s> It's a beautiful country. Very clean. Very civilized. And cold.
<s> Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat.
<s> Oh yeah.
<s> Then what the hell happened to him?
<s> Yeah, yeah.
<s> Then it happened before they scuttled her.
<s> Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
<s> If they knew what they were carrying.
<s> The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
<s> There's a charming thought.
<s> I bet you did.
<s> He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure.
<s> Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better.
<s> Better than starving to death.
<s> I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.
<s> Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.
<s> Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
<s> The guy. He just came this way.
<s> Greer?
<s> I'll call us in. Dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up.  Keep an eye on him.
<s> If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
<s> I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
<s> I don't know, are we?
<s> Just lucky I guess.
<s> Epps, over.
<s> If the weather holds it might not be so bad.
<s> I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
<s> Go.
<s> You got that right.
<s> Alright. I'll be right up.
<s> Sorry.
<s> So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
<s> Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
<s> Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
<s> Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
<s> Fine with me.
<s> You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
<s> Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
<s> Who?
<s> Are you going to yell at me?
<s> She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
<s> I just buzzed him in.
<s> Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
<s> Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
<s> Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call.
<s> It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
<s> I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
<s> Let me know as soon as you can, Enid. This could be a great thing for you.
<s> I didn't check my messages...
<s> But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
<s> Jesus...
<s> But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat...
<s> Why?
<s> Then why do you hate me so much?
<s> Because if you do, I'll kill you!
<s> Just take my word for it... if she ever finds out about this I'll never hear the end of it...
<s> Hey Josh.
<s> What?
<s> Good.
<s> Just look at them!
<s> Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
<s> Or maybe not.
<s> Oh yeah.
<s> Why do I always have to do it?
<s> Gross!
<s> Oh yeah...
<s> Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
<s> Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
<s> This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
<s> I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
<s> ...maybe we should be lesbos...
<s> I dunno, but next week is my last class...
<s> No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.
<s> You're insane.
<s> So should I come over?
<s> Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
<s> I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
<s> I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
<s> It's fine.
<s> Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
<s> Oh, hey Enid...  So... we finally made it!
<s> Nothing.
<s> Shhh!
<s> A mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose?  That's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy. Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that.
<s> Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.
<s> You're late, asshole.
<s> Hey, where are you going?
<s> Well why do I care about that?
<s> Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I can play regular records...
<s> So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
<s> You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? You can't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff...  I'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers.
<s> Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
<s> Yeah, well...
<s> Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
<s> PLEASE? We have to!
<s> Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
<s> I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
<s> If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
<s> Let the machine get it. I have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me...
<s> Hi, it's me...
<s> What? You're kidding me...
<s> Really?
<s> Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
<s> I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --
<s> In whatever way you think I mean.
<s> I had to see you.
<s> Can you at least let me in?
<s> What about this?
<s> FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
<s> How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
<s> I can treat him any way I want to - I'm an adult! Leave me alone!
<s> They're Seymour's.
<s> Right.
<s> Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
<s> That slut!
<s> Why don't we start with that next week?
<s> Yes?
<s> -malaria epidemic; very sudden.
<s> Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
<s> -that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
<s> I'm calling it my "contraption"- we're going to surround it with a boma- a fence, to you- and we're going to leave a small opening opposite that door.
<s> Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.
<s> -not a time for modesty, Bob-
<s> Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey.  With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight. 
<s> Well, he got away, didn't he?  Riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off.
<s> It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments.
<s> I am desperate to see Africa- but I hate the leaving.
<s> I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done. 
<s> I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
<s> Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen one.
<s> But you said they were always old.
<s> But of course yours worked.
<s> Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
<s> Because they are here.  Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world.  Come, John- to the bridge. 
<s> You don't know what Tsavo means, do you?  It means "slaughter"...
<s> Thank you, Samuel.
<s> I do, actually; very much.
<s> I feel the same about the bridge. This country certainly didn't ask for it, doesn't need it.
<s> You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
<s> Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
<s> I'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field.  It's a theory Ray and I were working on when we had to dissolve Ghostbusters.
<s> Do you ever see him?
<s> I won't.
<s> Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.
<s> That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
<s> I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
<s> Peter, what about the bathtub?
<s> How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
<s> Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
<s> Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants.  And that's just round one.
<s> What are you doing up here?
<s> Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
<s> I don't think we should leave her alone.
<s> Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.
<s> It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things --
<s> I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
<s> Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble.
<s> Hello, Venkman.
<s> I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
<s> Dana!  Dana Barrett!
<s> This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
<s> Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
<s> We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
<s> Are you kidding?  We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th.  I'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth.  Trust me, I used to drive a cab.
<s> We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.
<s> She's new in town.
<s> Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.
<s> Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
<s> No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
<s> I am Zuul.
<s> Thanks.  What's in there?
<s> Out!
<s> Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
<s> I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
<s> Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
<s> Here are tonight's calls.
<s> I'm not at liberty to say.
<s> In a storage facility.
<s> Yes, it would.
<s> Because you didn't say the magic word.
<s> See!  They are using drugs.
<s> Two wavy lines?
<s> Then my theory was correct.
<s> On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
<s> Were you recently in the bathroom?
<s> Will you guys relax?  We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
<s> Does she want to be?
<s> She said he was "the Destructor."
<s> Gozer.
<s> Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
<s> I blame myself.
<s> Looked at with your eyes.
<s> But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't even bargain with the guy.
<s> What do you mean "choose?"  We don't understand.
<s> And Caesar!  Let's not forget to serve Caesar!
<s> You're coming back?
<s> The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Do you want posters, too?
<s> We have to stop the Germans now!
<s> He left us at dawn.
<s> He must have been.  He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.
<s> I don't know...
<s> The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
<s> I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
<s> He's like you, sir, too tough for the Gods to swallow.
<s> Much more colorful than the ones we wear.  And, of course, less dented.
<s> Well, we can try...
<s> Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive.  They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them.
<s> I can see that...
<s> Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
<s> We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
<s> Let him trust Quintus.
<s> How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
<s> You teach them!
<s> I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
<s> I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> I'm sorry I took you in there.
<s> But could I just tell you this one thing?
<s> Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
<s> It just happened. It was just this thing that happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?
<s> No.
<s> That woman. The older woman.
<s> Ah. Where?
<s> Here? In Berkeley?
<s> Tomorrow?
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> What?
<s> All right. Put it in the room where we were.
<s> Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
<s> What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --
<s> What?
<s> No. 
<s> When is he coming back?
<s> Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
<s> What?
<s> Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
<s> Sit down.
<s> Benjamin?
<s> Will you unzip my dress?
<s> Yes, I have --
<s> I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
<s> Why is it?
<s> Yes. Yes. Let me out!
<s> I'll be up in five minutes.
<s> I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
<s> What?
<s> You're welcome.
<s> Are you kidding?
<s> Well what do you want to talk about?
<s> Well?
<s> How about art.
<s> What one.
<s> What novel did you read.
<s> There's no risk?
<s> About five years.
<s> On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
<s> No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
<s> No.
<s> I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
<s> Are you shocked?
<s> Not particularly.
<s> Yes.
<s> What?
<s> Oh my God.
<s> It was a Ford, Benjamin.
<s> Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.
<s> Let's drop it.
<s> Yes.
<s> Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
<s> You wouldn't.
<s> You don't have to say that.
<s> Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
<s> I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?
<s> Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.
<s> Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
<s> No.
<s> I do.
<s> About an hour ago.
<s> I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
<s> Ben, can I say something to you?
<s> Oh yes.
<s> That's quite a statement.
<s> Can you look through the glass.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.
<s> You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
<s> With the pearls?
<s> What about the money?
<s> Not with strangers.
<s> Money -- Ever heard of it?
<s> Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
<s> Aren't you?
<s> Free --
<s> All right. We'll dance.
<s> I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
<s> What do you want here?
<s> I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
<s> Yes -- I do understand.
<s> That is not so -- you don't want to be alone. 
<s> No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
<s> What?
<s> I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
<s> Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. 
<s> Yes -- yes -- yes.
<s> For Vienna?
<s> Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
<s> Don't worry. I'll be on the train.  He leaves.
<s> They've brought me such good luck -- you --
<s> Do I know him -- I know him through and through.
<s> How's the beautiful lady?
<s> The war dropped him here and forgot him.
<s> Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is.
<s> Insolent -- Berlin manners.
<s> I did not ask your advice.
<s> Good heavens. What for?
<s> I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
<s> No, doctor.
<s> I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.
<s> The Grand Hotel.
<s> Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I had pain I'd be too happy to notice it...
<s> Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.
<s> Yes -- that --
<s> Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.
<s> Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
<s> You don't understand that do you?
<s> Movies?
<s> Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
<s> Yes... A man I know took me to Switzerland last month...
<s> Only in mutual advantages -- moreover...
<s> Can't you understand me?
<s> You think so?
<s> Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we want to know.
<s> Since, on the eleventh of June, this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into -- both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages.
<s> Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
<s> Then, it's all over?
<s> Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
<s> Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
<s> Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, I'm told.  Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?
<s> Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
<s> I've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger -- What reason have we now? The Preysing Company has fallon upon evil days, very evil days.
<s> What a session this has been.
<s> All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.
<s> You haven't time.
<s> I wish to be alone.
<s> Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
<s> The performance -- the performance -- the performance. 
<s> I don't know you.
<s> I could not think of not accepting.
<s> Well -- gentlemen.
<s> Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
<s> Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
<s> You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush you down the toilet. Drive me to the Durando.
<s> I'll loan you a raincoat.
<s> What's that, Lilly?
<s> I like you, too.
<s> No problem. My husband gets up the crack of dawn.  It's his kidneys.
<s> And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
<s> We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
<s> You know who I work for.
<s> Lead on.
<s> Oh, sure. Fine.
<s> I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
<s> Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.
<s> Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep everything the way it was.
<s> Thanks, uh, Lilly.
<s> Well, that's good news.
<s> No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
<s> As though you do what I say.
<s> This way's perfect.
<s> Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
<s> You're smart, Lilly, and you're good-looking. You won't have any trouble finding a job.
<s> Oh, you'll live, Lilly.
<s> And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy.
<s> Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
<s> This time...
<s> Taking you for granite?
<s> Are you sure?
<s> You called the doctor, huh?
<s> Because it's comfortable.
<s> See you soon.
<s> I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
<s> Oh, come on, Roy.
<s> It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
<s> Upstate where?
<s> That's where they keep the criminally insane, isn't it?
<s> Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks. But how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand?
<s> You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
<s> I saw her.
<s> I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is.
<s> What?
<s> For Christ's sake, why not?
<s> I'm happy the way I am.
<s> Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh?
<s> Yes?
<s> Thank you.
<s> No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
<s> You up to it now?
<s> One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...
<s> They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
<s> Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
<s> Broken blood vessels on her right forearm.
<s> Girl scouts.
<s> It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
<s> ... I think it would be best if you both left.
<s> What the fuck are you talking about?
<s> And I should have a son who calls me "Mom".  Looks like we're both shit out of luck.
<s> Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
<s> Will, sit down...
<s> I was trying to protect you from this...
<s> I don't know.
<s> John...
<s> I'm okay.
<s> Looks great.  It does.
<s> He's my brother.
<s> Yeah.
<s> He gave me a fuckin' A?  Wow.
<s> You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
<s> Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
<s> Where's Shane?
<s> We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
<s> Then they can watch.
<s> There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.
<s> I promise.
<s> A man came by the house.  A psychiatrist by the name of Loomis.
<s> What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
<s> Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
<s> Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did.
<s> It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
<s> That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion.
<s> An old friend.
<s> Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
<s> Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.
<s> No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.
<s> I dunno, boy.
<s> Must have changed that law.
<s> The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
<s> Let's talk about it some other time.
<s> Go home!
<s> I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.
<s> She was about to get married again. She locked me out of the bedroom last night.
<s> He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
<s> When?
<s> Oh.  I'd forgotten.
<s> Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
<s> When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
<s> I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
<s> In what way, pray tell?
<s> You're an imbecile.
<s> Everybody thinks that.
<s> The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
<s> They were enemies.  We were at war.
<s> What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
<s> Out!
<s> As a matter of fact--
<s> Are you--do you--
<s> Do you know who Wanda June is?
<s> Where's Mom?
<s> He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father?
<s> England?
<s> Tell me that!  Tell me that!
<s> Go on.
<s> Where did you get the poison?
<s> No, no, no, no, no.
<s> Penelope!
<s> Scat!
<s> You're free to go to her, if you want.  If you'd rather be a woman and run with the women, just say the word.
<s> What time do you get off work, my child?
<s> Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
<s> I couldn't help overhearing that you were about to get married again.
<s> Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
<s> Have some.
<s> I could carve a better man out of a banana!
<s> Buy yourself breakfast.  There we go.
<s> You're wrong.
<s> We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
<s> I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
<s> And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.
<s> Sneaking in the back door.
<s> He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
<s> About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
<s> I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
<s> What a handsome word.
<s> I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have to fight with steel. I can fight with words.  I'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  Call him up in East St. Louis, Penelope.  Tell him to come here.
<s> No.
<s> I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.
<s> Don't!
<s> There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking.
<s> Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
<s> Out!
<s> Gentlemen--that's nice.
<s> It's always locked.
<s> She still has just the one child-- the boy?
<s> I was going to ask.
<s> I can just hear the editorial wee- wee-weeing when Looseleaf and I start flying in pacqualinincheewa root.  I can hear the Alice-sit-by- the-fires now: "We discovered it in the Amazon Rain Forest.  Now we cure you with it.  Now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks."
<s> This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
<s> It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
<s> We'll find out now, won't we?
<s> I've struck my blow.
<s> Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
<s> My mother-in-law.  Fire engines, pulmotors, doctors, cops, coroners--
<s> Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
<s> Premature ejaculation.
<s> Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?
<s> Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
<s> Maybe he'll come back tonight! It's his birthday.
<s> You're married!  You've already got a husband!
<s> You're the only woman he ever took out.
<s> That man is your father.
<s> Dr. Woodly?  You know who this is?
<s> Then get him.
<s> A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
<s> How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
<s> It's jungle rot!  This room is making everybody sick!  This is your family doctor speaking now.  Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety.
<s> I'm glad.
<s> I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
<s> When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
<s> That's when I'll get my confidence back.
<s> Women are always late.  You'll find out.
<s> Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.
<s> We got a birthday cake, kid.  Did you see the cake?
<s> He's the most wonderful guy I ever met, Penelope.  He's the most complicated guy I ever met.  I can't believe it, but he's going to take me to Africa with him.
<s> Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
<s> He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!
<s> He'd go to a movie.  I think that's what he'd do.  If I were sure he was in a movie, I could stop worrying.  We could have him paged.
<s> I believe in miracles now.
<s> Tell her to have a nice trip.
<s> It's really that bad?
<s> I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
<s> Not true.
<s> None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
<s> Yes, we do.
<s> Shit! You just don't want to hire a nigger, that's all. I knew this was a scam. I shouldn'ta come.
<s> You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
<s> Big threat. TV would ream you.
<s> Do you want to take a session?
<s> What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.
<s> You're not a film producer, are you?
<s> No.
<s> A friend.
<s> You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
<s> Not very.
<s> Tijuana.
<s> Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
<s> Where does he live.
<s> What makes you so sure?
<s> Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
<s> Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
<s> Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.
<s> Well, what do they know?
<s> Mr. Van Dorn?
<s> No.
<s> That's like a stag film.
<s> Do you think she's safe?
<s> Get out.
<s> I just heard. Who is he?
<s> Does she know anything about this?
<s> What is going on?
<s> What will I tell the others? They care about you.
<s> Okay.
<s> If you want to watch when we shoot a film, for fifty bucks, I let guys stand around and watch. It's a lot cheaper.
<s> Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you don't have to share the profits. There's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again?
<s> Well, each time he comes in closer, like this.
<s> You're taking a big chance.
<s> Nope never saw her before.  Kurt, come over here. Don't use underage kids. Wouldn't touch 'em for all the cow shit in Mexico.  You recognize this piece of wool, Kurt?
<s> No.
<s> Oh, <u>yes</u>? Well, that's all right. I've got a brother who's a real cut-up, too. I'll never forget the time we had this old TV set with no parts in it. Well, Tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family. We were all hysterical. And here's little Tommy pretending to be Walter Cronkite.
<s> I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
<s> Possession of a stolen shovel.
<s> Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
<s> And that truck - is it registered in your name?
<s> Eh, no.
<s> Oh, at the dentist's?
<s> Well, then, you must come back and visit.
<s> I don't know. Just one of those. 
<s> Because they are all the same.
<s> That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
<s> But we can't just dig it up!
<s> My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
<s> Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Yes. It's almost there.
<s> Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.
<s> Pray? No.  I communicate. 
<s> Give me that.  I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.
<s> No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
<s> Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
<s> Like a tea ceremony?
<s> I wouldn't say "benefit."
<s> Why?
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
<s> Thank you, Uncle.
<s> War is not all black.
<s> Another man's life in your sights.
<s> ZAT!
<s> Oh sure.
<s> Eh?
<s> She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one...
<s> Oh yes. That's fine.
<s> Then I suppose it was me. Get in, Harold.
<s> No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
<s> I knew you'd come.
<s> It certainly is.
<s> Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
<s> So you slept O.K.?
<s> God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know.
<s> Finish what?
<s> What are you talking about? Who are you?
<s> The Cenobites.
<s> See what??
<s> Amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point.
<s> I abhor violence.  Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't think me mad --
<s> I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
<s> No. It's not.
<s> I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
<s> Reliquary --
<s> Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
<s> Oh, stop that --  Damn! Be careful, there --
<s> That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
<s> Oh, as opposed to -- ?
<s> "In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
<s> Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
<s> I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
<s> This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
<s> Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens.
<s> I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
<s> I can live with that.
<s> No one ever helps me. It's my job.
<s> No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
<s> Not from you.
<s> No. Myers is taking me.
<s> Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.
<s> Doesn't sounds like him.
<s> He's just pushy.
<s> Coffee's warming me up.
<s> What -- ?
<s> -- Late. Five minutes late.
<s> Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
<s> Sure.
<s> It'll go in.
<s> Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
<s> You did this before, right?
<s> HE did. I've seen him.
<s> No. That wasn't the deal.
<s> I have to speak to my father.
<s> That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK.
<s> His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
<s> Let me see.
<s> You're still afraid.
<s> So you were cheated.
<s> Maybe.
<s> I need a skin. Then we leave --
<s> Hi. I got soaked.
<s> I have to see my father.
<s> I was here this afternoon.
<s> I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
<s> I'm going to throw up.
<s> I'll be scarred for life.
<s> Larry....
<s> I'm here.
<s> What's wrong with you?
<s> Please...
<s> I don't know where to begin...
<s> Let's keep it that way, shall we?
<s> That's right.
<s> What happened to me?
<s> My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
<s> I said: I found a room.
<s> I love you, honey.
<s> Really?
<s> Finished?
<s> I don't believe it.
<s> I thought we'd lost you.
<s> If there's a train.
<s> Oh, I don't know. Up-tight. Frigid.
<s> What happened to you?
<s> Don't let them take me, Steve --
<s> What's next?
<s> Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
<s> What do you mean, "what?"
<s> Ehh.
<s> To me, it would mean that you're a liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick.  We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century.
<s> Because it's a brilliant film.  It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.
<s> Ha.
<s> Laura said we could.  If we helped out with the posters and stuff.  And we did.  And we are.
<s> We're getting that anyway.
<s> No, you can't.
<s> No.  The Righteous Brothers.
<s> You can be and are wrong.
<s> We work there!
<s> Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry?
<s> I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
<s> I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
<s> Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
<s> So.  Is now a good time?
<s> OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
<s> Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
<s> Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
<s> I understand, Dick.
<s> "Abraham, Martin, and John." That's a nice one.
<s> I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck!  Now get your patchouli stink out of my store.
<s> Good.  So.  Is it my job?
<s> Just the obvious stuff.
<s> No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?
<s> Nevermind.
<s> Will you please just go?
<s> You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime.
<s> Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.
<s> You do, huh.
<s> Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
<s> Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
<s> I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place.
<s> You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.
<s> Those aren't mine.
<s> You're being deliberately obtuse.
<s> Pig died.
<s> My dad died.  My dad, my dad.
<s> Hi.
<s> Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
<s> Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
<s> But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
<s> You're tougher.
<s> Wanna go to dinner?
<s> I tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great.  I thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way.
<s> That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
<s> It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
<s> Not in love, exactly, but...
<s> Hey.  It's Liz.
<s> Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to take sides.  And I like Laura with you.  She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together.  I just wish you two could, I don't know.  I don't think much of this Ian guy --
<s> It's true!
<s> Yup.  Not far from here, actually.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Right.
<s> Everything all right?
<s> Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
<s> Records are those big round black things, right?
<s> The boy _died_?
<s> Basil the II.
<s> Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
<s> Where?
<s> Have you gone to the police?
<s> You are being foolish.
<s> Not all of them.
<s> At least.
<s> You won't.
<s> I see.
<s> What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
<s> You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
<s> Now there's a new topic.
<s> Thanks.
<s> What's all of this got to do with me?
<s> Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
<s> It's that important?
<s> I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  It's just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?
<s> -In nomine sanctus esperitu-
<s> I am from Spain.  And I would like a moment of your time.
<s> It is less.
<s> I don't know why.
<s> This can't be.
<s> Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend yourself.  In this I can help.
<s> Me arm hurts.
<s> All living things pay dues, Conor.  They must be respected for that.
<s> That is not me.
<s> So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
<s> You're not talking sense, Mara!
<s> Certainly not me.
<s> They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
<s> Stay out of it.
<s> Head still secure to the neck.
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> You were never a kid.
<s> I've had a few more concerns.
<s> MACLEOD!
<s> I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy.
<s> And if I refuse?
<s> No.
<s> It doesn't.
<s> That's none of your business.
<s> I've got all the time in the world.  Except right now.  If you will excuse me, Lieutenant.
<s> But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
<s> I'm getting married tomorrow.
<s> No. Roy. Roy V.
<s> I'll come a-running, pardner.
<s> You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
<s> He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
<s> That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
<s> Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
<s> Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
<s> I'm sure you haven't any.
<s> Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that.  Walter!
<s> Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Yes!
<s> Where are we going?
<s> I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
<s> Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
<s> Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
<s> Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
<s> Thanks a lot.
<s> Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --
<s> If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!
<s> Gee! Take a look, will you?
<s> You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
<s> Close that door. Don't let anybody in or out.
<s> Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very interesting. This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with!
<s> No, you don't!
<s> Out of the mouths of babes.
<s> Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?
<s> What?!!
<s> Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
<s> Just what I said. That's what I --
<s> I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
<s> Dead?
<s> No!
<s> That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
<s> I'm not working for any other paper!
<s> He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?
<s> How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!
<s> I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
<s> Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
<s> Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
<s> Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
<s> You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
<s> Huh!
<s> What tickets?
<s> Is he coming back here?
<s> Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!
<s> Is this the Community Hospital?
<s> Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
<s> I mean -- working together. Just like the old days. The things we've been through, Hildy.
<s> Walter!
<s> What's the matter with my brains?
<s> Walter, you can't do that!
<s> You got plenty of money?
<s> They can't do that to me!
<s> Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
<s> Give me a hand with her, will you?
<s> What's the use? I can't win a pot.
<s> Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
<s> The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.
<s> What's the dope, Sheriff?
<s> This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
<s> Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
<s> Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
<s> What do you mean -- through?
<s> Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
<s> But we're going to hang him, Fred. He can't get away.
<s> And you fell for it, Pete. It frightens me what I'd like to do to you.  Who else knows about this?
<s> Now what do you say?
<s> Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
<s> I'm telling you!
<s> Oh-h-h... was she hurt?
<s> Phone for you, Hildy.
<s> Okay, Hildy.  Well, we can't get any official statement --
<s> All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
<s> Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right here.  One hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. Now sign.
<s> I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
<s> What -- already? Why, the dame left only a minute before I did!
<s> I'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me.
<s> How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
<s> No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
<s> Isn't that her picture?
<s> I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
<s> I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.
<s> The what?
<s> You mean here in the city?
<s> Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
<s> You can't bribe me!
<s> Hello, Mollie.
<s> Say, Hildy...
<s> I know.
<s> Very well, Grandpa.
<s> With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
<s> You're much more convincing when you're making it up.
<s> Who told you that?
<s> Sod.
<s> Not now. They wouldn't believe me.
<s> He's the worst liar.
<s> ...and four and five...
<s> Well, for the baby, really.
<s> ...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
<s> Kiss me Hardy.
<s> If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will.
<s> I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac, marching past.  Made my hair stand on end.  I thought, I've been asleep for twenty years.
<s> Propaganda. We've been had.
<s> You taste it.
<s> I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
<s> Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
<s> Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.
<s> No, Mother! It's War! War!
<s> You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
<s> And now we're glad you did.
<s> I don't mind it. It was harder before the war. Trying to keep up appearances. Now it's patriotic to be poor.
<s> Tipsy, topsy, turvy.
<s> I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese.
<s> Things like that get a lot bloodier than ya think.
<s> No, I told you...
<s> Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
<s> Come on.
<s> Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
<s> OK.
<s> Yeah, come on.
<s> Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?
<s> OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up.
<s> Nice.
<s> I was just wondering.
<s> You know... a couple of queers.
<s> I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
<s> I don't drive cross country.
<s> I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
<s> Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign.  Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit.
<s> And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
<s> Thanks.
<s> He won't move.
<s> Turn that fucking radio off!
<s> I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.
<s> It's a girl.
<s> We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
<s> Hmmmmmmmmm?
<s> And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
<s> Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care.
<s> The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.
<s> That kid is one horny retard.
<s> Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.
<s> That's nice.
<s> No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.
<s> Hey, listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
<s> Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.
<s> No please, let me sit this one out.
<s> Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
<s> Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10.
<s> Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see anything now, it's too dark. Let's forget it.
<s> Turn on the headlights. See if anything is out there.
<s> I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
<s> Keys.
<s> His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
<s> What do they call you, sweety?
<s> Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
<s> Huh?
<s> No, just a little too old.
<s> Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had, total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK.
<s> You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized.
<s> I um... no, I don't think so...
<s> Oh, alright... I guess I can trust you... being a man of the law and all.
<s> Oh, you are very welcome... Lord knows how I love a man in uniform.
<s> No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em before...  ...he looks familiar, is he on TV?
<s> I ain't sure that you really need to know. It's better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs.
<s> What! God damn, how many?
<s> Over here, inside the smokehouse.
<s> Yeah...  ...huh, what the hell are you talking about?
<s> Call the chief... We found 'em.
<s> Right...  ...come on.
<s> We found one.
<s> Uh...  We must never act like apes, son. For you see, The ape is our closest biological relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp.  A single chromosome separates us. But you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes?
<s> Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
<s> Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
<s> Great.  God, I've wanted you forever.
<s> Oui, doctor, oui.
<s> Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you.  Now I'm embarrassed that I say this.
<s> I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh?
<s> I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
<s> Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.
<s> No! It is now that you must decide.  I love you, Doctor Nathan...  ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish.  My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you.
<s> You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need!
<s> No. You look so beautiful.
<s> Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts!  I love you, Gabrielle.
<s> Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
<s> Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Oui.
<s> Where do we look for little lost Puff?
<s> It's okay, Puff.
<s> It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
<s> Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
<s> Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.
<s> He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something.  Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.
<s> Oh, Rosie.
<s> Paper or cloth?
<s> Yes, and...
<s> I'll be out in a minute.
<s> Fifteen.
<s> I think he's feral.
<s> Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
<s> Your entire body?
<s> Sure. Of course.
<s> My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project.
<s> Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila.
<s> I'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors.
<s> Lila?
<s> Got it.
<s> I have to talk. Is that okay?
<s> And how do you feel about Gabrielle?
<s> Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow.
<s> It's open...  What'll you have?
<s> That's right, Miss Packard.
<s> Do we need words?
<s> No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
<s> That's the way it's done.
<s> Well, Mr. Felson, maybe you could come out to my place some evening. We could play a few games of billiards.
<s> Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
<s> The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
<s> Yeah. Sure, sure.
<s> To do what?
<s> Why?
<s> For who?
<s> That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
<s> Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
<s> You know everybody, don't you?
<s> I been thinking.
<s> No, no. When you play for me, I pick up all the tabs.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I said we're leavin'.
<s> You want me to tell her for you?
<s> In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
<s> If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
<s> What's your game? What do you shoot?
<s> Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
<s> You well-heeled, partner?
<s> Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.
<s> Yep. Fastest and the bestest... Hey, give us another round, will ya? One for him, one for yourself.
<s> You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
<s> I feel tight -- but good.
<s> Eddie...
<s> Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
<s> So am I... Sit down.  Would you get us a couple of drinks?
<s> Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
<s> My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
<s> What for? To play Fats again?
<s> Glad to meet you.
<s> I'm having some people over for drinks right after the races. Why don't you all come over? Then about nine, ten o'clock we can play.
<s> Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.
<s> Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
<s> Hey, you're Eddie Felson, aren't you?
<s> Yes.
<s> What bus?
<s> How come you didn't catch your bus?
<s> I'm not.
<s> I drink.
<s> Come here.
<s> What did you say that for, Sarah?
<s> You want to go with me?
<s> Yeah. For a little while.
<s> Me. It's Eddie.
<s> I got beat up. They...  They broke my thumbs.
<s> What's it so hot in here for?
<s> Nothin'.  Want another drink?
<s> Leave now.
<s> I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
<s> No.  I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.
<s> You're, uh, you're Minnesota Fats, aren't you? You know, uh, they say Minnesota Fats is the best in the country out where I come from.
<s> Thousand dollars a game.
<s> It comes back.  Flashes.  My name.
<s> Who?
<s> Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
<s> Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
<s> I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
<s> I guess you could say that.
<s> That's the Air Force Base.
<s> If we want it, it is.
<s> It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.  The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...
<s> Yes -- but ...
<s> I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
<s> May I ask why?
<s> I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
<s> I'd believe him.
<s> I don't see anything.
<s> Who are you calling?
<s> What happened to your other slipper?
<s> What?
<s> I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
<s> Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
<s> You have to leave the White House.
<s> David, don't...
<s> Did it work?
<s> Punched the President? Oh my god.
<s> Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.
<s> That signal. It's a countdown.
<s> You don't move soon. I'll begin to decompose.
<s> Three years.
<s> Dad...
<s> She always keeps her portable phone listed, for emergencies. Sometimes it's just her first initial, sometime her nickname...
<s> She didn't take my name when we were married.
<s> It's perfect the line is busy?
<s> You can do that?
<s> What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing!
<s> What'd I say?
<s> It's not me. They're overriding the system.
<s> Better than we thought.
<s> Sir, I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately.
<s> It had been deemed classified.
<s> Yes, I am.
<s> Butt-munch.
<s> I'm a dancer.
<s> Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
<s> You sure?
<s> We're leaving.
<s> Above American soil?
<s> Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
<s> There is no museum in Iskenderun.
<s> The dog!?  You are named after the dog...
<s> Yes. My treat.
<s> Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
<s> Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
<s> Where?
<s> Dad was onto something here!
<s> Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.
<s> Got lost in his own museum, huh?
<s> You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend.
<s> Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.
<s> That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
<s> You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
<s> We're through!
<s> Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!
<s> Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
<s> It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.
<s> So it did.
<s> Where is it? I want it.
<s> Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
<s> Will you take it easy!
<s> Brody's this way.
<s> What final challenge?
<s> What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
<s> I know, Dad!
<s> You call this archaeology?
<s> I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
<s> Junior?! Dad...
<s> What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
<s> Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
<s> No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
<s> Of course. The Thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped Kali with human sacrifices. The British Army wiped them out about the time of the Mutiny of 1857.
<s> It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa. The kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him.
<s> Miss Scott panicked?
<s> When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
<s> And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
<s> Yeah, that's what happened...
<s> What?
<s> Nobody's perfect. The way I heard it, you stole one of them from a small village.
<s> You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones.
<s> Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
<s> Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
<s> Long ago -- before my father's father.
<s> Hey, he's not a waiter...
<s> Siam.
<s> Holy cow -- India? How do you know we're in --
<s> Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
<s> Don't catch cold.
<s> I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
<s> You've got to go to sleep now.
<s> There's got to be another way out.
<s> Who's you?
<s> No.
<s> I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
<s> Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  Why don't I just take you back to UST?
<s> I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
<s> With Authority!
<s> Just scratched my arm, why?
<s> Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.
<s> You are in trouble. Now do it.
<s> Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
<s> The beach.
<s> She's beautiful...! What do I do?
<s> Where are you staying?
<s> ...Rene...
<s> To the hotel. To register.
<s> But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
<s> You have no taste.
<s> Are you serious?
<s> She's the toughest to read.
<s> What if she says something important?
<s> Joe! It's 56 hours!
<s> Is that all?
<s> Why don't you get out of my face.
<s> I told you, I have a feeling...
<s> I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her.
<s> You have to! Quickly!
<s> I can't see a thing.
<s> No. You can't trust her.
<s> I've got an idea.
<s> Just say the words. Just like I told you.
<s> He didn't. He left us that walkman chip to confuse us. Would have kept most people busy. We were too fast for him.
<s> Aim what?
<s> Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
<s> Ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. Looks like all they need is the chip.
<s> We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
<s> Keep thinking.
<s> You've changed your mind.
<s> Yeah, sure.
<s> Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
<s> What part what?
<s> Oh, I can't.
<s> Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
<s> He's not an ordinary man.
<s> That name's familiar.
<s> What?
<s> How do I look?
<s> Here?
<s> Oh....Sure.
<s> I will?
<s> What?
<s> Not you. Them.
<s> A little voice in my head.
<s> I said...I didn't say..anything!
<s> You did. JOE No I didn't. You said   something first.
<s> Yes, of course.
<s> Me still. They left you alone?
<s> You are.
<s> That you're not crazy.
<s> Why do you do it?
<s> You did.
<s> You're talking to me.
<s> They kidded me a little.
<s> There's not much to tell.
<s> Sometimes. I told you I did.
<s> How do you know you can trust me?
<s> Beats me.
<s> ...across THE BORDER. Come on!
<s> It was my choice.
<s> You're gonna laugh.
<s> You are, I've seen you.
<s> We're not moving fast enough for him.
<s> I know a nice island.
<s> I can't get it out. It would take hours.
<s> Yes.
<s> So we better get started.
<s> Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
<s> Instant rice...?
<s> What's that outside, Daddy?
<s> That remote control thing?
<s> Yes, baby?
<s> Lowell?
<s> Sure. Where?
<s> I'll be there.
<s> Okay.
<s> Excuse me, Lowell. Sharon's on line 3.
<s> ...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
<s> C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living...
<s> Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
<s> End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't think so.  Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared.
<s> Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?
<s> You alright, Mr. Wigand?
<s> Hey, Lowell.
<s> You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.
<s> Yes, it's on the stove...
<s> They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
<s> "Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
<s> These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
<s> Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face.  That's why.
<s> That's room service. They usually knock first.  Come on in... Over here, please.
<s> Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
<s> Far as you go where?
<s> If you want to do it.
<s> To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
<s> How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
<s> And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
<s> Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
<s> Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
<s> Good.  You have kids?
<s> Tempura...
<s> I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
<s> What do you want to do, Lowell, look up my ass, too...!
<s> ABC...?
<s> I fought for you... and I still fight for you.
<s> I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
<s> What?
<s> She's okay.
<s> In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...
<s> And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
<s> Well, I wouldn't say --
<s> I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?
<s> Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. Naturally, she misses her kids. Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair. Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop.
<s> I just want to make sure that you both --
<s> Is that... one person?
<s> No frown lines.  New watch?
<s> Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
<s> We did not.
<s> The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
<s> Yes?
<s> Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
<s> That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
<s> I don't know, but don't call me Marylin.
<s> Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
<s> He manufactures staples and industrial brad-tacks. He's very successful.
<s> Maybe they put a horse head in her bed?
<s> I think Ming is older than Tong.  What is this?
<s> I'll be right back.
<s> Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
<s> Did you see the tape?
<s> You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that.
<s> That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
<s> Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
<s> Have you tried the duck?
<s> Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
<s> No. Don't stop.
<s> And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
<s> Yes, Miles. I accept.
<s> In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
<s> I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house.
<s> I love you. I want to have your baby.
<s> I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It is YOU.
<s> You have to leave the house immediately!
<s> Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
<s> Fine. They were created during a dictatorship.  What if something happened to you? What would I tell little Gus when he asked "what was my daddy like?"
<s> My whole metabolism is -- off.
<s> Like I know his intention? Or yours for that matter?  I should join Sam. I'm too old for this bullshit.
<s> He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
<s> Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me.
<s> He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
<s> Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile.
<s> My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
<s> My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
<s> Rex, please.
<s> I don't know. I can assume...
<s> Video.
<s> What are they?
<s> Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
<s> What...?
<s> I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
<s> Yes sir. If you'll excuse me, sir—she sent me for a drink.  Andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs, following which the scene dissolves to the UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR in front of Ellie's door. Andrews enters and knocks several times. Receiving no response, he gingerly opens the door.
<s> I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for—
<s> I'll get it annulled.
<s> It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him. 
<s> No, I'll go through with it.
<s> Amateurs!
<s> What happened to your money?
<s> If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
<s> What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
<s> Well—of all the—well—  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
<s> Seems to me I've already thanked you for that.  What time is the next bus to New York?
<s> Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
<s> You must have me confused with—
<s> Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
<s> Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
<s> I can't go out like this.
<s> Like this. I have no robe.
<s> I met some very interesting women at the showers. We got to chatting about this and that. You know how time files.
<s> Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
<s> That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
<s> You always want to run everything.
<s> Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
<s> To New York?
<s> We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
<s> All right! Don't take them off. Do whatever you please. But shut up about it.
<s> Oh, Peter— 
<s> No. But I've got a penknife. 
<s> You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a car—and I won't use my thumb.
<s> Mind your own business.
<s> Why not? I'm hungry.
<s> Come on! come on! 
<s> Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
<s> Nope.
<s> Goodnight, Mr. Warne. 
<s> You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
<s> Not interested. 
<s> Left twenty minutes ago.
<s> Husband?
<s> Ain't gonna wait a minute.
<s> You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. You can go down to the Sheriff's office.
<s> If you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours.
<s> Yes?
<s> What time is it?
<s> Yeah!
<s> Huh?
<s> Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
<s> Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
<s> "How would you like to have the story, you big tub of—of—"
<s> Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
<s> I'd like to sit with my—uh—wife—if you don't mind. 
<s> Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time. 
<s> You're a pretty shrewd baby.  We better get away from this gang. Talk this thing over privately.
<s> Sure—sure—I'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
<s> When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
<s> You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
<s> Hell, no!  I told this Bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.
<s> The anonymous kind, Chief.
<s> Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill? I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist... after the arrest, 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again.  Now here's another one for you:  What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had been trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine?
<s> Yeah.
<s> This is Louisiana, chief.  How the hell do you know who your daddy is? 'Cause your momma told you so... You're way out there taking a crap in the wind, boss, and I for one ain't going along on this one.  Jim sighs, saddened.  Bill was one of his best men.
<s> Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
<s> And then Sunday?
<s> I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
<s> Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
<s> Fuckin' A.  How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!
<s> Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is too fuckin' big for you!  Who did Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't you get it yet?  I can't be talking like this.  They're gonna kill me. I'm gonna die!  I don't know what happened.  All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest - live in a monastery, study ancient Latin manuscripts, pray, serve God.  But I had this one terrible, fatal weakness.  They defrocked me.  And then I started to lose everything.
<s> But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
<s> Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
<s> Sure it is.  Freckle Face, if I ever handled a minor felon like that, it'd be all over the papers.  I'd catch hell.  And this is the alleged murderer of the President?
<s> Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
<s> No, you don't!
<s> No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
<s> I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.
<s> I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying "We both know who's responsible."  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?
<s> David Ferrie.
<s> Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
<s> That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered.  My statements...
<s> Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
<s> Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
<s> It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday.  A quiet little chat between gentlemen.
<s> Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
<s> How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
<s> Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
<s> I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm tired.  I've had enough!  They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking.  You're ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid "trial"! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?
<s> Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
<s> Boss, the President's been shot.  In Dallas.  Five minutes ago.
<s> Lou, you were in the Marines.  Who would be running that training?
<s> I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
<s> We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
<s> Between six and seven seconds.
<s> How many men?
<s> Allen Dulles?
<s> Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.
<s> Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One "pristine" bullet?  That dog don't hunt.
<s> Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?
<s> Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
<s> No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
<s> I think it started in the wind. Money - arms, big oil, Pentagon people, contractors, bankers, politicians like L.B.J. were committed to a war in Southeast Asia.  As early as '61 they knew Kennedy was going to change things... He was not going to war in Southeast Asia.  Who knows? Probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - Houston, New York - hell, maybe Bonn, Germany... who knows, it's international now.
<s> His name?
<s> More than ten years.
<s> I don't know if I should talk about this.
<s> Anything more specific, Jack?  It's important.
<s> There was one guy, I don't know, big guy, business guy, white hair - I saw him come into the office once. He looked out of place, y'know - like a society guy.  Can't remember his name.  Oswald was with him.
<s> Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?
<s> He'll never make it.  If he wins, they'll kill him.  He wants to avenge his brother.  He'll stop that war. No, they'll kill him before they let him become President.
<s> Germany.
<s> Yes?
<s> That sounds fun.
<s> Who was there for your ass?
<s> Three years.
<s> Let me finish. Can I finish?
<s> Course you didn't.
<s> I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
<s> Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
<s> Hey, Jackie.
<s> She ain't said it, but she's not stupid, she knows it's you who wants her.
<s> Help you get Ordell Robbie.
<s> Okay.
<s> I thought you might want a drink?
<s> So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
<s> Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.
<s> The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
<s> How many trips did you make?
<s> Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
<s> I don't care.
<s> I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
<s> You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
<s> Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
<s> Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
<s> Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
<s> That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
<s> All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
<s> It's not that simple.
<s> I hesitated taking that much.
<s> I'm just tired in general.
<s> Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
<s> Do you live together?
<s> You know what's in the bag you're taking?
<s> You planted that shit on me.
<s> He sells guns.
<s> What are you doing?
<s> And splittin' with her?
<s> What did you say?
<s> But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
<s> Well, it's true, isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think?
<s> If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
<s> Do you think I took some of that money?
<s> Great...  ...Wanda!
<s> He told me to go outside.  "You may leave us now." It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be "the man." You know Mr. Walker don't you?
<s> Beaumont Livingston?
<s> I don't think so, but thanks for the beer.
<s> Got some o.j.?
<s> I knew it.
<s> I think it's a gun pressing against my dick.
<s> The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
<s> They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
<s> I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> What'd you care?
<s> Well, you weren't supposed to be there.
<s> She don't know shit about the money.
<s> Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
<s> Designer clothes.
<s> If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
<s> Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
<s> Yeah, there's another hit left.
<s> You been to Japan?
<s> Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
<s> Does that bother you?
<s> That's good money.
<s> You're outside?
<s> That was Beaumont.
<s> Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise.
<s> What does that mean?
<s> Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'
<s> I shot her.
<s> You know how she is.
<s> In the chest and stomach.
<s> Look, that's the bag she came out with. She never even put her hand in it, and neither did I.
<s> That's right.
<s> Fuck you for asking me that.
<s> You gonna tell me who it was?
<s> Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
<s> He's a big one. You two tight?
<s> You think you could do that?
<s> Man, he won't like that. Beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition.
<s> She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess.
<s> Did the police contact you?
<s> Was she?
<s> Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
<s> I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older.
<s> And where's Jackie?
<s> By herself. That big mandingo nigga Winston ain't there, is he?
<s> I know where to turn.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> No problem.
<s> Just to see you. That's all.
<s> Stop!!!!
<s> It's short, huh?
<s> Just my luck.
<s> He was upset. He thought people were following him.
<s> That's right. We did.
<s> This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
<s> Why do you say that?
<s> How long had that been going on?
<s> Maybe that's the only way to get through. Besides, six heads'll be better than one.
<s> You should go back to her.
<s> I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
<s> It's freezing.
<s> What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
<s> I didn't want to wake you.
<s> If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> I don't know.
<s> A good lay.
<s> I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
<s> Where?
<s> Show me Della!
<s> If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
<s> Get your clothes off.
<s> Lie down!
<s> He did? When?
<s> Let go!
<s> Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?
<s> I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
<s> Stick with me, kid.
<s> I love you when you're angry.
<s> Who are you? What are you doing to me?
<s> It's over, Jake. It's all over.
<s> What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
<s> Long time ago.
<s> A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
<s> Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me.
<s> One drop?
<s> Glorious. I'm not surprised. I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I'm just glad you came back.
<s> I no from around here.
<s> That's what I'd like to know. If you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he's fired.
<s> Push 'em back.
<s> Help me!
<s> Jacob Singer?
<s> Who is?
<s> You come home with me.
<s> How did it happen?
<s> Yes it does.
<s> If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
<s> No.
<s> He....He...
<s> I think I broke my arm.
<s> Then stop talking and work faster!
<s> Faster! Don't we have another gun?
<s> Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.
<s> Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.
<s> You just keep an eye out.
<s> Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live.
<s> Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
<s> I'm pulling, damnit!
<s> Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.  Last chance.
<s> So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.
<s> I thought you meant...
<s> I think I had some when I was eight.
<s> I know you.
<s> I get it.
<s> No shit. I got no problem with that.
<s> Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
<s> Again?! Jesus!
<s> You're leaving me here alone?
<s> Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
<s> Kay-em 14.
<s> You need to get laid!
<s> Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
<s> We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
<s> Alright, I'm . . .  No way . . . is this a joke?
<s> Obviously so.
<s> You're crazy!
<s> Hockey player? He's not a ...
<s> Old Earth?
<s> Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
<s> Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there.
<s> I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
<s> You got it.
<s> Two cases. And dinner when you land.
<s> What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
<s> Where...?
<s> Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news.
<s> You going to be all right?
<s> My kids were on that beach...
<s> Swell.
<s> Rogue?
<s> Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
<s> I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.
<s> A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...
<s> A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
<s> Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
<s> I can't imagine why.
<s> What else could've done that?
<s> I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this.
<s> It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
<s> Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!
<s> Twenty years.
<s> I do.  But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.
<s> You're leaving?
<s> I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
<s> Martin hates boats. Hates the water. On the ferry to the mainland, he sits in the car the whole way over. He's got this childhood thing, there's a clinical word for it.
<s> I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello.
<s> 25 feet. And three tons of him there.
<s> Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet suit.
<s> The shaft is giving.
<s> That's it! I'm standing here arguing with a guy who can't wait to be a hot lunch. Goodbye.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> Thanks for the message.
<s> I did the prep questions for this lab last night. You can copy my answers if you need to.
<s> I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
<s> Or something.
<s> What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
<s> Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin.
<s> You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
<s> Also, I think I'm in love with you.
<s> Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
<s> Yup.
<s> I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.
<s> No... I guess not.
<s> No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
<s> I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
<s> Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
<s> I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it.
<s> I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool.
<s> Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners.
<s> Oh, go fly a kite.
<s> Something happened. Because your eyes? Are very cold? They're very cold, Josh. They're cold, lying eyes.
<s> Geeeerta Rauuuss!
<s> Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
<s> Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
<s> You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Listen.
<s> Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
<s> That suits you.
<s> You're something else.
<s> I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
<s> I actually know this one.
<s> What are you?
<s> Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. You're just not trying.
<s> God, you're so young.
<s> No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
<s> A Maker's Mark, please. Up.
<s> Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.
<s> Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
<s> Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!
<s> Elbow.
<s> I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.
<s> Either I just pissed my pants or...
<s> Thundercats are go!
<s> I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.
<s> Silencio! I just drank my weight in Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto.
<s> Jesus, I didn't say it was.
<s> That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
<s> I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
<s> Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.
<s> It was magnificent, man!
<s> What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.
<s> Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.
<s> Or stage parents!
<s> Right, seriously.
<s> I'm not jealous, and I don't care. I just know he doesn't like Katrina and I don't think he should toy with her emotions like that. She seems so nice and all.
<s> Yeah, downtown.
<s> Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
<s> I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
<s> What's Early been in jail for?
<s> Early, you are so sweet.
<s> What'll we do out there?
<s> Early, can we stop there... just for a little while.
<s> I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
<s> That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
<s> It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
<s> Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
<s> Ain't you goin' to record it?
<s> If you say so.
<s> They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here.
<s> What happened to Adele?
<s> Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
<s> A book on the warehouse murders?
<s> I still think we should have met them first.
<s> Bitch, bitch, bitch!
<s> Fuck!
<s> A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.
<s> I'm finished.
<s> Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
<s> I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
<s> What are you going to do?
<s> Where's Adele?
<s> No, thanks, I can manage.
<s> ...Brian hurt his foot.
<s> No, never. Excuse me.
<s> Wasn't my fault...
<s> With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Are you hungry?
<s> A little bit. But I didn't really want her to.
<s> I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
<s> Yep.
<s> Three pennies and a ball of lint.
<s> No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends.
<s> Oh. You like her?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> I don't know. How much do you want?
<s> Fifteen for me.
<s> Why not? You stink.
<s> Don't look for him. He's doing fine. He's gotta girl. He's fuckin' her right now in Steven's parents' room. So do ya know Joe.
<s> Right here.
<s> Yeah me too.
<s> Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
<s> Don't take a bath. Come swimmin' with us!
<s> You have?
<s> Yeah. I can understand that.
<s> Come on.
<s> No...
<s> Do you care about me?
<s> No.
<s> I tested positive?
<s> Because gee, you don't look OK. I mean you're a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all...
<s> A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> Yeah?
<s> What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
<s> It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.
<s> No, I didn't bleed.
<s> Yeah?
<s> I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
<s> Yeah. She should be at Nasa tonight. Why you lookin for him? You like him now or sometin'?
<s> I no understand you. Maybe crazy.
<s> Yeah.
<s> And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco
<s> But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
<s> Yeah.
<s> Hi Telly. Where you been?
<s> But then I won't need your money.
<s> Yep.
<s> To come?
<s> OK.
<s> It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
<s> What?
<s> How'd you get in here?
<s> Anything?
<s> Sanderson?
<s> Did anyone stand out?
<s> Who is this?
<s> Where is she?
<s> Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
<s> So is mine, within the framework of my rules.
<s> You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
<s> I used a variation.  You should have anticipated that.  Have you figured out the message?
<s> Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check, Peter.
<s> No.  As usual you're wrong.  It is her I want.  Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat.
<s> Set up some pieces on the big board?
<s> Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me.  There can't be more than a handful.
<s> Never mind.  He died two years ago.
<s> The scars on your chest.  From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.
<s> Fuck off!
<s> I just can't believe it.
<s> You're losing me.
<s> My cheering section.
<s> He moves around a lot.  Why?
<s> That's a big area to cover.
<s> What does that mean?
<s> The most logical choice.
<s> No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
<s> Ten days ago.
<s> Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
<s> I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  I can't afford to miss a game.
<s> It doesn't make sense.
<s> I understand that this is just another one of your games.
<s> Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
<s> Whatever's on your mind.
<s> Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
<s> It's alright.
<s> Yes.
<s> If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
<s> I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
<s> It is.
<s> Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
<s> I can't right now.  I've got a game.
<s> You sound like my mother.
<s> How can you look at it so clinically?
<s> Yes you are.  You're playing word games.
<s> Then show me who you are.
<s> Would you settle for pepperoni?
<s> What's wrong?
<s> What?
<s> He didn't tell you either.
<s> I got lucky.
<s> Well, you're beautiful.
<s> I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
<s> Does the Queen live?
<s> Everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death.
<s> Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
<s> She is too deep. The curved tunnel we saw is part of the Vortex, the place of The Beast.
<s> Yes.
<s> The Beast will kill her.
<s> Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
<s> I forbid you!
<s> Saddles.
<s> Yes.
<s> A forest near the Valley of Needles.
<s> Hah! You don't know me, boy.
<s> They do not exist, except in the waters of the Swamp, where they will remain.
<s> At the gallop!
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> I ...  ... am Titch.
<s> Get me down from here you louts or I'll turn you all into pigs!
<s> They will have the life that you and I might have had.
<s> With an old voice?
<s> Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
<s> There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here.  We'll find her.
<s> Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
<s> No, she was not as beautiful.
<s> It is no trickery.
<s> Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.
<s> You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
<s> Huh? I see, but this is the FBI, little girl, and I can't let you in.  But if you leave me his money, I'll give him it myself.
<s> OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
<s> No.
<s> What, for example?
<s> Oh really?  But can you miss the car?
<s> OK.
<s> Quick doesn't mean "ready". And you can't discuss, we said. Right?
<s> No, you can't go out.
<s> Mathilda, stop, please!
<s> There are better things.  You see the importance of the "moment".  Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it.  This way, he already departed. Without knowing.
<s> You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
<s> I love you so much, Leon.
<s> ...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
<s> Huh? That's smart!
<s> Huh? Why?
<s> Messina.
<s> Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
<s> No... Dino's.
<s> It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.
<s> No it's not.
<s> If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
<s> How serious is it?
<s> Can it kill me?
<s> I'm going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar.
<s> No.  How far in one attempt -- what's the farthest someone like myself could walk?
<s> It's just a regular day.
<s> What's that?  That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune.  What you have is a statement.
<s> What do you want from me?  Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you?  Yes... Yes I would.  You know that.
<s> Don't be so sure.
<s> He's plastered.
<s> Good.
<s> And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.
<s> This guy's not a murderer.
<s> You tell stories?
<s> What was that?
<s> Yes.
<s> She knew you loved her.
<s> So I've been informed.
<s> I was thinking you could open another store with investors.  I'm sure a lot of people would want to get involved with you now.
<s> It's mine to risk.
<s> No more words.  Until I touch the ocean with my hands... it's all just words.
<s> Yes.
<s> Hello.
<s> What are my choices?
<s> Water?
<s> Hello.
<s> To death?
<s> No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
<s> Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?
<s> Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
<s> Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
<s> Sorry.
<s> OK.
<s> Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
<s> I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
<s> Then come.  I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
<s> Oh, and what did you do?
<s> You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
<s> Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
<s> Oh, Ben... you look so very sick... my love... you're so pale.
<s> I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
<s> He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.
<s> Did she have a weapon in her hand?
<s> That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.
<s> How about --
<s> Spill.
<s> No!
<s> Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.
<s> You know her?
<s> Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
<s> You're kidding!
<s> What?
<s> Yes, he is.
<s> Thank you. I love you, too.
<s> Did she do that to you, too?
<s> Neat.
<s> Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
<s> And D) Brooke is obviously hiding something.
<s> How do you figure?
<s> I'm quitting.
<s> We're on our way to the bridal show in New York so we thought we'd rescue you from law school for the night.
<s> Where's Warner?
<s> I can't believe you're a Laker Girl!
<s> But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around.
<s> No.
<s> Fine. Except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my Civ Pro professor. But no biggie. You're here now.  How was your summer?
<s> I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
<s> Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
<s> Three months.
<s> Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you.  Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
<s> Cunnilingus?
<s> Yeah, luckily.
<s> But I'm hideous!
<s> Kill me... I want... so nice...
<s> I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art.  They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach.  The pain remains constant.
<s> What will become of me then?
<s> From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.
<s> I'm in no mood for dancing.
<s> I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.
<s> I fear she's lost.
<s> Big question that, lad.  Why what?
<s> Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
<s> We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
<s> Drop a mountain on him and we won't need our troops.
<s> We march on Castle Couer de Noir within the hour.
<s> Whatever for?
<s> Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
<s> Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
<s> Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time.
<s> Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
<s> It bodes evil.
<s> Stay on your guard, Jack.  The bug is enchanted surely.
<s> We do both.  Our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under...
<s> Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly.
<s> And frog don't fly and bite like tomcats.  It be magic, Jack... powerful ogre's magic.
<s> Will you chance a miss?
<s> Mean you to seek him out below?
<s> She lives like all the world before the Baron's curse lifted.  Now the world's reborn, yet still she sleeps...
<s> Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
<s> You'll do it because I am you liege and I command you to do it!
<s> Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
<s> I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.
<s> I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
<s> I don't want it on me.
<s> Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions.
<s> Then, perchance you'll me.
<s> You've freed me, Jack...
<s> That's why he goes masked during the day...
<s> You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
<s> Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
<s> Do I not please you, Jack?
<s> Jest with me then.
<s> A faerie's love makes anything possible.
<s> Watch behind or I'll never collect on it!
<s> Small miracles better than no miracles...
<s> Of course they're alive.  All nature is living.
<s> Up ahead!
<s> Done like a champion.  Can you reach me with the line?
<s> It's done... we'll never catch him.
<s> Oh, but I have.
<s> You've been inside?
<s> He was there and then he wasn't!
<s> We can work.
<s> It's so beautiful.
<s> What color?
<s> You'd better call and cancel.
<s> I couldn't sleep last night.
<s> Has he eaten anything at all?
<s> I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh.  And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying.
<s> Is that legal?
<s> He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
<s> You look better without make-up.
<s> I can use your mom's.
<s> I'm not gay.
<s> You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
<s> If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
<s> Floating to Catalina.
<s> A violation?
<s> If that's what it takes.
<s> It's thirty feet.
<s> how much weight have you lost?
<s> How's your wife?
<s> I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
<s> It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?
<s> She didn't really say.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
<s> There are no windows facing my...exposure.
<s> You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
<s> I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
<s> You'll know me by the time we're through.
<s> If you hit me, I'll call the police.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I might have a solution.
<s> I won't ever hit you.  I don't want you smaller.  I want you to be happy.  You're not.  Not here with me. Not home with your mother.  Not up in Tahoe.  Not alone.  Not anywhere.  You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes.  In your sleep. In your answer to everything.  You're barely alive.
<s> Nothing.
<s> He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.
<s> Are you taking them still?
<s> I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
<s> A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
<s> I need you to do me a favor.
<s> I don't let him.  He just loves to.
<s> He doesn't answer.
<s> Where have you been for a week?!
<s> Why call me?
<s> Well, for later then.
<s> That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
<s> The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George.
<s> I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
<s> I smiled at him.
<s> Don't even...I'm there.
<s> I'm thinking it's too weird now.
<s> What?
<s> Good.  That was the plan.  We couldn't stand him and George needed help.
<s> You can't go because of Sam?
<s> You can't go with me because of Sam?
<s> What are you doing home?
<s> I never asked for more.
<s> Take it off.
<s> Either do you.
<s> Okay.
<s> Why?
<s> Nigger.
<s> Cost you a pair of nylons.
<s> Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
<s> But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?
<s> My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me. You look just like she said.
<s> She got married last month.
<s> Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
<s> I can't wait to see that. You slay me, man.
<s> Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way.
<s> Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
<s> What do you know about boats? I bet you can't even swim.
<s> Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
<s> Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
<s> On your behalf. What happened to we?
<s> You know what, Claude? This whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. That plan with your cousin, did that include me?
<s> New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay?
<s> Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
<s> Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
<s> Say what?
<s> The hell you talking about? What train?
<s> Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers are playing a double-header against the Red Sox.
<s> Don't matter who Camp 12 puts on the mound. All I know is when this season's over Camp 8's gonna have pork chops.
<s> I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises.
<s> They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now.
<s> My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now?
<s> The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
<s> We're not talking, you're talking, and doing too damn much of it, if you ask me.
<s> He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
<s> I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
<s> No, believe me, I'm gonna kill him!
<s> Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
<s> Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
<s> Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.
<s> New York. That's up north, ain't it? They'll find we do things different down here.
<s> Judge gave 'em the long ride.
<s> Move it out.
<s> That's right. We don't need no fences, we have the gun line. It runs from shack to shack clear around the yard. You are now inside the gun line...
<s> You heard what the man said! Move it!
<s> He's a good friend of mine. Drops by the club whenever he's in town.
<s> Come on, old-timer, hook the brothers up.
<s> I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
<s> It'll be too late.
<s> You may be able to buy your way out of trouble up in New York City, but down here we take murder seriously.
<s> Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
<s> Greenville, that the nearest town?
<s> You found him.
<s> Let her go.
<s> What do you think about... Earth?
<s> Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
<s> Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
<s> Maybe try the opposite of that.
<s> I can't screw.  I can't screw.
<s> That turn you on there, RuPaul?
<s> It's freezing up here, Beefy.
<s> I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
<s> Got ya.  Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
<s> C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
<s> This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
<s> Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
<s> Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
<s> Should we wake him up?
<s> Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.
<s> Dude. Seriously?
<s> I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
<s> Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
<s> That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
<s> Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
<s> Why would you be floating?
<s> Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
<s> Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
<s> ...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
<s> Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.
<s> "Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..."
<s> I don't know?
<s> I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
<s> No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
<s> Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
<s> Where do we go?!  Where do we go from here??!!
<s> Do you know how long all this will last? Not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. Ages will roll... Ages. And you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
<s> Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
<s> Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --
<s> I'm very smart.
<s> Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
<s> I thought I had to do something.
<s> Not about that.
<s> You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
<s> I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
<s> Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
<s> The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
<s> "Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
<s> He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
<s> Of course.  I don't know where...  I just took them for granted.  It's our only chance.
<s> No.
<s> It's all right with me. Is he here?
<s> For as long as I can remember.
<s> Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
<s> Never, never, ever. Nothing.
<s> Not yet.
<s> I promise. We'll go on as soon as it's light.
<s> Stay? They lived together all their years?
<s> I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
<s> What do you mean by that?
<s> I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
<s> Right... This just glided along.
<s> As best we can.
<s> Or not so recently?
<s> Yeah.
<s> You know what I think?
<s> There's no such thing as a bad coincidence.
<s> Yeah, I remember.
<s> It's me...
<s> Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes.
<s> He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
<s> Okay.
<s> No.
<s> The wife killer?
<s> No... Here he comes.
<s> Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
<s> Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide.
<s> Coming up.
<s> DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
<s> A videotape.
<s> No, nothing.
<s> I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
<s> Yeah?
<s> I wish I knew.
<s> But...
<s> Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
<s> Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
<s> You know who it is.
<s> I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.
<s> Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".
<s> I don't remember... What happened that night?
<s> I don't want to talk about it...
<s> I do like you, Sheila.
<s> Come on.
<s> Yes. Might as well - all of it.
<s> I'm a paleontologist.
<s> A paleontologist.
<s> Well, what do you know about that!
<s> Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
<s> It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
<s> Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
<s> That's ridiculous.
<s> Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
<s> colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people—
<s> Horns? What kind of horns?
<s> And be poisoned out here in the open?
<s> Gold. You were going to—
<s> Well - I'm—
<s> How do you do?
<s> So there are others?
<s> Who, for instance?
<s> And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
<s> The only one.
<s> You've very kind Mr. Lovett.
<s> Are you so certain you are away from it?
<s> No, Mr. Conway, I'm not lying. What reason could I have for lying? The chances are that we'll never come out of that horrible trip alive, but I'd rather die out there in a snowstorm and be buried alive, than to stay here one more minute now.
<s> Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
<s> Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
<s> Yes, Bob.
<s> Do try to sleep, Bob.
<s> I don't know. I can't get the dialect.
<s> It's not knowing that's so awful, Bob. Not knowing where you're going, or why, or what's waiting when you get there.
<s> It looks like it.  Smell those fumes?
<s> Dead?
<s> That's where we were this morning. He had it marked. Right on the border of Tibet. Here's where civilization ends. We must be a thousand miles beyond it - just a blank on the map.
<s> What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
<s> Chang's first question was about the pilot.
<s> George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
<s> So you think I'm mad?
<s> So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
<s> Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
<s> Why not?
<s> You're wrong, George.
<s> I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
<s> What if he refuses?
<s> You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
<s> We'd be eternally grateful if you—
<s> Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
<s> I wonder.
<s> You see, it's not a dream.
<s> Why, mother?
<s> I'd love it!
<s> It's Fenner.
<s> Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
<s> I gotta be honest about something.
<s> Oh, you'll still, be guarding him.
<s> They don't.  Now, son.  If you get the job, you're going to be working with some very particular people who like to do things in some very particular ways.  Here's a little piece of advice:    Don't use this so much.
<s> Well this didn't.
<s> Actually, sir--
<s> Oh. Shit. it's in the car--
<s> Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...
<s> Why?  What are you gonna do?
<s> I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.
<s> This is a college?  I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival.
<s> Keep her out of here while I check it out.
<s> You don't know the half of it.
<s> You don't know me at all.
<s> Let's check am out.
<s> I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
<s> A what?
<s> No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
<s> What if he's telling the truth?
<s> Since as long as we've been keeping records...
<s> Do his job.
<s> Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
<s> What is it?
<s> But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
<s> Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of.
<s> Most entirely.  Earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which, in order for the planet to survive, must be exterminated.
<s> Nope.  Nothing at all.
<s> Will it lower the curve?
<s> This guy.  Where was he?
<s> May I have a look?
<s> They went right to the President.
<s> I got a planet check on that bug.  It's from way the hell out in the third belt. it's organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system.
<s> Don't tell me.  Insects.
<s> Just a guess.  But I think found a nest.
<s> Can you see?
<s> Anderton --
<s> Oh, Jesus...
<s> The nano... what?
<s> No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
<s> Drowning.
<s> Try again.
<s> Don't worry, Lamar.
<s> Hang on, Lamar --
<s> Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
<s> I understand.  Sir.
<s> What?
<s> I'm fine.
<s> And who the hell is that?
<s> Everybody runs.
<s> Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.
<s> The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
<s> Sir?
<s> Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
<s> Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
<s> Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
<s> It helps if you don't think of them as human.
<s> That's right.
<s> They don't belong to anybody.
<s> I feel bad about that.  I need you to forgive me.
<s> Some -- somebody's father?
<s> I put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay.
<s> The precogs were wrong.
<s> Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
<s> I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
<s> Obviously, for Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.  After all, what good is a Justice system that instills doubt?  It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.
<s> Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
<s> You shouldn't.  You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself.  Not the young federal agent who wants your job.  Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created.  Don't trust anyone.  Just find the Minority Report.
<s> I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
<s> Wait, just a second...
<s> Yes.  This is from the twins, Arthur and Dashiel.  Agatha's stream was missing.  Now this one is from the cyberparlor.  Anderton downloaded it directly from Agatha. Watch...
<s> I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
<s> How?
<s> Yes.
<s> I think you're swell company, Knott.
<s> Who?
<s> Sure.  Raincheck.
<s> Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
<s> Have you been there recently?
<s> You mean after he lost your son.
<s> You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
<s> They were grabbing her fucking ass --
<s> Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.
<s> Snifter are for warm drinks --
<s> What's 'incidentals?'
<s> Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
<s> Nightlife. Where's the hot ass?
<s> But maybe that's okay. Maybe that's just what you need.
<s> You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
<s> Ricky, can you put on a seat belt?
<s> She's, uh, sleeping.
<s> Chloe?
<s> Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
<s> Some favor. I hope they know you're not like Wendy.
<s> You shouldn't. He likes you.
<s> Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
<s> Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
<s> How could you let her see this?
<s> I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
<s> She'll be out in a minute.
<s> No.
<s> What do you mean 'troughed?'
<s> And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.
<s> This one?
<s> No.
<s> Ruiz knows about this?
<s> You told him you liked him.
<s> He'll work it off.
<s> How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
<s> Take a few days --
<s> Nah, man...
<s> Hi. I'm Jimmy.
<s> Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
<s> Understand me?
<s> Ricky's taken care of.
<s> Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
<s> He's not here.
<s> What are you saying?
<s> Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
<s> It's not losing record.
<s> Don't be shitty.
<s> Yeah. I know the number.
<s> I know the number.
<s> Then why do you try to get in?
<s> Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
<s> C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
<s> Pretty nice.
<s> What's the movie?
<s> You sure?
<s> How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
<s> Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
<s> But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
<s> What are you doing?
<s> You think Maxie doesn't want us to roll hard? Why do you think he gave us all this bread? Or the number on the pager? We gotta represent him by showing some class. The man's got an operation. How does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it?
<s> Well, I don't want to walk.
<s> They said a hundred thirty-fifth and Twelfth.
<s> I told you what they said.
<s> Oh, give me a break. Don't tell me you feel bad for the guy.
<s> You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
<s> His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
<s> I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins.
<s> You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
<s> What do you have left?
<s> I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
<s> What do you mean 'kinda?'
<s> That's a good idea, maybe I will!
<s> The line's over there.
<s> Cool. See you later.
<s> Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
<s> Drinks are free, right?
<s> Where do you live?
<s> 'Strapped?'
<s> You really in trouble?
<s> Couldn't make it. Here's the money.
<s> You're from LA, right?
<s> And the money. Where do we bring the money?
<s> Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right?
<s> Outfit? What's he talking about?
<s> So, you must be the Red Dragon.
<s> No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
<s> You never had it.
<s> There's two guns on you.
<s> 'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
<s> I ain't said I'm ashamed.
<s> No. That's the name of the slave- master who owned your family. You don't even know who you are. You're nothing. Less than nothing. A zero. Who are you?
<s> But the key to Islam is submission. That is why twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of Holies, to pray. We bend our knees in submission.
<s> Mr. X, I won't make you out a liar.
<s> Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
<s> Why do you ask?
<s> Are you?
<s> Yes. Did you eat?
<s> You're with me even when you're away.
<s> What do you think?
<s> Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
<s> What do you want me to do?
<s> I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.
<s> So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
<s> The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
<s> But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
<s> Sure, man.
<s> Now you come back.
<s> Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
<s> All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
<s> Your control over your children, therefore --
<s> Please make way, please --
<s> No. You'll be marked for death.
<s> What's your story, baby?
<s> Well, all reet, then.
<s> Fine as May wine.
<s> Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
<s> I was special. The only colored kid in class. I became a sort of mascot. Like a pink poodle.
<s> It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
<s> It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
<s> Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
<s> [It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia. The gun you're about to find in that suitcase.]
<s> It's a little late.
<s> So what do I get in return?
<s> [Do you know who I am?]
<s> [Who's he?]
<s> [How do I recognize him.]
<s> [In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
<s> [Her life for your life.]
<s> [And one of the founding members of La Hermanidad.]
<s> [And?]
<s> I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
<s> Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.
<s> A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
<s> I know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. Like us.
<s> I go to school, don't I?
<s> Maybe. Did you hear him?
<s> Where?
<s> White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
<s> [Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?]
<s> Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me.
<s> I know you're not.
<s> Still not a question.
<s> Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
<s> Never.
<s> No.
<s> You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
<s> No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that.
<s> Yeah? And if she was ugly?
<s> I know! I just had to let one go because I couldn't afford him!
<s> For a year?
<s> When?
<s> What? Who?
<s> [We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this.]
<s> [I should start going for your tits first.]
<s> And they took that away.
<s> All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
<s> Listen. You people go grab a table. I'll be back inna minute. I'll be right back.
<s> Oh, yeah.
<s> There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.
<s> I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
<s> Angie, by the time I get Clara home, it's gonna be one, one-thirty. By the time I get home, it's gonna be two o'clock. I gotta get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.
<s> She musta kept you inna shadows all night.
<s> Come on over about half past seven, we'll think of something.  Hello, Ma, what's the matter?
<s> Well, he died. You know who else died?
<s> You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
<s> This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
<s> I know it pains.
<s> I'm having a very good time, too.
<s> Yes, I know.
<s> I don't.
<s> I think anything you want to do, you'll do well.
<s> Maybe that would be a good idea.
<s> I like you. I like you. I been telling you all night, I like you...
<s> Please...
<s> Please...
<s> We just live one flight up.
<s> Sure, great if you ain't married.
<s> What girl, what does she know?  Why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while?! Your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine!
<s> Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine. So they ask me, would it be all right if Catherine come to live with us. So I said, all right with me, but we have to ask you. Marty, she's a lonely old lady. Nobody wants her. Everybody's throwing her outta their house...
<s> You not ugly.
<s> Oh, it's a sad business.  My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.
<s> Oh, sure.  Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
<s> I heard you, Ma.
<s> She didn't look Italian to me.
<s> Waddaya read there, Joe?
<s> You just sit here, I gotta turn the fire on under the cooking. 
<s> The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
<s> So she say, "You're spilling the milk." So she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk I spilled, so she got me so mad, so I said, "Mama, you wanna see me really spill some milk?" So I took the bottle, and I threw it against the door. I didn't throw it at her. That's just something she made up. She goes around telling everybody I threw the bottla milk at her. I didn't throw it anywheres near her. Well, I was sorry right away, you know, but she ran outta the house.
<s> That's all right, that's all right...
<s> We want you to do a very big favor for us, Aunt Theresa.
<s> I don't wanna talk about it!
<s> Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?
<s> Waddaya talking about?!!
<s> Never this close.
<s> How you, Radar?
<s> Home.
<s> Back home.
<s> Look at that right eye.
<s> I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.
<s> That's okay. Live a little, learn a little.
<s> Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
<s> This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
<s> All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
<s> Screw it. We been earning our keep as respectable knife artists. Why should we do work any pill-rolling punk could handle?
<s> No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
<s> I can't... couldn't.
<s> You ever caught this bread, and forgive our syndrome before, Duke?
<s> N-n-no thanks, G-General.
<s> At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
<s> What?
<s> I like an olive.
<s> Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
<s> You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
<s> I don't get it.
<s> He can move in here with us.
<s> Not necessarily.
<s> That's right. We work well together.
<s> No, thank you. I'm not the slightest bit interested.
<s> No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
<s> There's nothing ridiculous about it.  A kid like you...
<s> No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
<s> They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
<s> It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.
<s> Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
<s> I didn't mean with me.
<s> Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
<s> I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
<s> Thanks.
<s> I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.
<s> Poker sounds great. When do you play?
<s> That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
<s> Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
<s> That's all the commitment you're offering me?  Or do you have some more extravagant gesture of cooperation?
<s> You mean who hit who?
<s> Yes, sir?
<s> They can't do that to me!
<s> What's that, Henry?
<s> Are you all right?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> All right, but present it to him as a great cause for the common man.
<s> The Websters.
<s> Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
<s> It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammers—start arguments.
<s> What's that?
<s> What letter?
<s> Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
<s> So?
<s> The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!
<s> Holy smokes! Wasting my time listening to this mad woman.
<s> Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
<s> Well, what about it?  Let them see him!  We'll go them one better. They can also hear him.  You own a radio station, Mr. Norton. Why not put him on the air?
<s> If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
<s> Thank you.
<s> That's—
<s> I used to pitch.
<s> Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
<s> Take charge of him. Get him a suite at the Imperial and hire some bodyguards.
<s> Naw.
<s> The heelots!
<s> I know why you're hangin' around—you're stuck on a girl—that's all a guy needs is to get hooked up with a woman.
<s> A gag. A gag!
<s> Yeah? Well, you can have it!
<s> Sure, sure. I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
<s> Better make it doughnuts, huh?
<s> John Doe Club?
<s> Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk.
<s> Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea.
<s> You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
<s> No.
<s> There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good people—they ought to run you out of the country—and I hope they do it!
<s> Thanks.
<s> Did you want to see her about something important?
<s> Good night, John.
<s> Well, you know how they are in baseball—if a guy's mixed up in a racket—
<s> Well, I was just thinking about this John Doe business. Why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Okay.
<s> Hold him.  Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening.
<s> What?
<s> No, sir.
<s> Hello, Roper. Glad you could join us.
<s> Deal.
<s> It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett.
<s> I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
<s> Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
<s> We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
<s> Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.
<s> What if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?
<s> Sorry... Habit.
<s> Like it had to be done.
<s> I know.
<s> We could fill it with water.
<s> I don't gamble.
<s> Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
<s> Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
<s> Why?
<s> A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.
<s> Still needs work.
<s> Occasionally you lose.
<s> Pull up alongside.
<s> I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
<s> Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
<s> You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
<s> What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.
<s> Greg.
<s> What do you want from me?
<s> A deeper level?
<s> Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
<s> Your concern is heartwarming.
<s> Who's running it?
<s> We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for.
<s> If you could meet God, what would you say to him?
<s> That's the grace of this world.  Nothing's impossible.
<s> True.  But why?
<s> Yes.
<s> In here I am.
<s> The weather.
<s> There is no --
<s> What?
<s> The Terrace.  First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
<s> Good question.
<s> No.
<s> -- You told me.
<s> -- The inside?
<s> Once they digitized you, they added it.
<s> Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
<s> Just like that?
<s> Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
<s> -- Waiter.
<s> Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
<s> Stylin'!
<s> LET'S FLY!
<s> Look closer.
<s> The legend goes that you release the power with the power.
<s> Did I say anything?
<s> GO IVAN!!
<s> We couldn't have done it better ourselves.
<s> But I've never served a day.
<s> Since Colosimo bit it, I gotta keep an eye out for his friends.
<s> Maybe. But he'd still be the Boss.
<s> Mr. Rothstein, Can I be frank? You're a gambler, and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef.
<s> Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.
<s> From your mouth ta God's ear.
<s> When you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
<s> But if ya can't catch the guys...
<s> Who hired the bastard?
<s> Ya mean we're so rich we're broke?
<s> No. I'm here with you.
<s> I must be going.
<s> I was calling yesterday.
<s> London?
<s> As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.
<s> I told you twenty!
<s> What's your problem?
<s> They don't give a shit about us!
<s> Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
<s> I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
<s> Never threaten me, Boss.
<s> Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
<s> You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
<s> He's the Boss of all the Bosses, and I respect him.
<s> I got partners.
<s> That's why I'm here.
<s> The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
<s> No matter what you say to me Salvatore, you are my bambino.
<s> Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
<s> Come on. Be polite.
<s> Fuck 'em.
<s> I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
<s> Stu. That was right about the time we met.
<s> I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
<s> Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
<s> Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
<s> Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
<s> Tell me what?
<s> YOU SET ME UP!!
<s> That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.
<s> Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
<s> The ring...
<s> Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
<s> Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
<s> What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
<s> I don't want to talk about it.
<s> That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
<s> Oh.  I thought today was Saturday.
<s> Oh, it was such a big scandal.
<s> Oh.  Well, that would be a ... change.  Thank you, Mrs. Peterson.  You have a very reassuring voice.
<s> Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
<s> Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
<s> Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
<s> Eight to five Little Boy Blue is plastered.
<s> That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.
<s> You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
<s> Well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no use combing my hair for nothing.
<s> Wait--wait. Let's see--watchdog McGann-- he's bound to move right in--get him out of the way first--  Pardon me, friend--I've got some telephoning to do--! 
<s> He isn't going to hurt enough as it is. *She* has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! "I'll turn my glamour on him," she says--
<s> And to Don Quixote!
<s> Do we *have* to?
<s> Why me?
<s> Yes, yes--phone, phone--  A--an outrage, pet--an outrage--I'll look into this--  Hello--Joe!--What!--No! Not really! Terrible!
<s> Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert!  Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!
<s> Well, your children are very bright-- and *they* say Jefferson Smith.
<s> Now, wait fellows--great Heavens. I've got to see those angry committees first--feel them out a little--work for harmony--harmony.
<s> Me! Jim--how--?
<s> Well, Jeff put that out himself.
<s> What stuff?
<s> Emma! Will you *please*--?
<s> Emma!
<s> Emma! I will not have conversations of this sort carried on by the children at dinner!
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> I am about to ask for a roll call on the passage of the Resolution--without further delay. The Senator can have nothing to say at this time that would not be either in bad grace or--
<s> I yield.
<s> Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--
<s> That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
<s> Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
<s> Mr. President--gentlemen--I--I have risen to a painful duty--to say that, out of evidence that has come to my attention, I consider Senator Smith unworthy to address this body!
<s> Will he yield for a question?
<s> Every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--
<s> I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
<s> Now, now, now!  It's all right, Governor.
<s> Most natural thing in the world!
<s> Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
<s> Right.
<s> Tonight.
<s> Calendar?
<s> The Steering Committee.
<s> I said--shall we get started *now* or--
<s> Thanks very much.
<s> Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--
<s> City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
<s> No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
<s> I also answer to whistles.
<s> Look--I think we ought to skip it.
<s> And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
<s> No, I haven't. I guess I thought the name was familiar.  By the way, you discussed with Senator Paine where the camp was to be situated and everything?
<s> Great.
<s> Do you want to dictate them?
<s> Don't mention it--
<s> Oh--Saunders--
<s> Well! You don't say!
<s> You were about to recognize me, sir--
<s> A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?
<s> Listen, Joe--at least--after a day like this--I got one good bust coming before I start showing him monuments--
<s> Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
<s> Well, well!
<s> It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
<s> Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
<s> Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him.
<s> I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
<s> Maybe he won't get up.
<s> Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
<s> Keep doing it! This is the whole works, Joe--we're out of business of bigger than we then we ever were. We can't miss a trick--we can't stop at *anything*--till this yokel's smashed up and buried so deep he'll never--!
<s> I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.
<s> Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
<s> Who's that?
<s> Never can tell what he's going to do.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> I haven't.
<s> No!
<s> Yes!
<s> It isn't all! I'd like to explain—
<s> Look, this is my house. I'd like to—
<s> What happened?
<s> Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living.  Oh, I'm really just a nobody.
<s> No. That is, I didn't—  Until I met you. I like talking to you, though—  Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
<s> Really?
<s> Oh, I don't mind.
<s> Huh?
<s> Me?  Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men. I see General Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and I can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as President—  Things like that can only happen in a country like America.
<s> I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you?
<s> He sounds like a person worth while knowing.
<s> Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
<s> Oh, hello darling.
<s> No. It's nothing.
<s> I can't write it, Mabel! I don't know what's the matter with me.
<s> Why? Why do we have to do it?
<s> He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
<s> I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
<s> It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
<s> Had the boys follow us.
<s> I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
<s> Hello . . .
<s> Shhh!
<s> But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh—
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Better wire him right away, John.
<s> The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip.
<s> Wants to know who the heir is.
<s> See you later, kid.
<s> You can't?
<s> What?
<s> Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
<s> No, thanks.
<s> That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
<s> Why should you?
<s> Entertainment?
<s> Arthur wants to quit!
<s> They'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. They've got you down as a sap.
<s> Thank you.  If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor.
<s> Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
<s> But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?
<s> I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
<s> A child? My uncle's?
<s> And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
<s> Yes?
<s> Take the stand!
<s> Not at all.
<s> I'm kind of nervous. I've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life. Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though.
<s> Christian Svenson.
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> What two policemen?
<s> An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Good kids.
<s> Hmm?
<s> Were you supposed to have a session?
<s> Right now?
<s> How do you mean?
<s> And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
<s> Mr. Follett.
<s> You are so mean.
<s> It's a thought I had.
<s> I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.
<s> I've had my moments.
<s> I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
<s> Yes, your honor.
<s> Oh, I don't know...
<s> Lily, I don't think even you could know that --
<s> Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.
<s> It's a pretty piece of land.
<s> ...And?
<s> ...so accomplished.
<s> He told you.
<s> Don't need it.
<s> I'm trying.
<s> Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
<s> Take a hike, Dr. Quack!
<s> Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
<s> I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
<s> Is she against you getting help?
<s> No.
<s> Where?
<s> So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
<s> Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip.
<s> You like it?
<s> That's one way to put it.
<s> I don't know if --
<s> No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
<s> Um-huh.
<s> Will you be here?
<s> If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> No again?
<s> Nah... scotch.
<s> Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
<s> You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.
<s> Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
<s> -- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
<s> You are Panda, monarch of modems.
<s> Jerking off?
<s> Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.
<s> All new people start with that...
<s> English Lit.
<s> Really?
<s> Yep.
<s> Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
<s> Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.
<s> You're not going to kill us?
<s> Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!
<s> What is he doing here?
<s> No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
<s> Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra?
<s> According to the ancients, cat's are the guardians at the gates of the underworld. Imhotep will fear them until he is fully regenerated, and then he will fear nothing.
<s> Correct, And that's when --
<s> He said... he was just looking for a good time.
<s> You swear?
<s> No, I mean --
<s> Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
<s> Who was talking about what?
<s> No you're not.
<s> Not unless you call me Rick.
<s> Yeah? So? Is that my problem?
<s> Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see that guy's face?
<s> Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.
<s> And when those dirty Yanks go to sleep --  No offense.
<s> Read the inscription on the cover!
<s> Awfully.
<s> OWCH! That's really got to hurt.
<s> That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague!
<s> Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
<s> And then he'll be coming after Evy.
<s> When was that?
<s> The Inscrutable Six?
<s> I can't.
<s> I thought you'd never ask.
<s> Half a Dirty Dozen!
<s> Doctor Heller?
<s> I got it.
<s> And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
<s> You're a spy.
<s> It is?
<s> I just want to be a superhero.
<s> Monica, where are you?
<s> I know I haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a chance?
<s> And you are a fool.
<s> Yeah yeah -- and that, too.
<s> I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
<s> But there's still only six of us.
<s> Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
<s> So you're chicken?
<s> Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
<s> See ya tomorrow.
<s> Shhh.
<s> Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night!
<s> Yes.
<s> We're superheroes.
<s> Not yet.
<s> We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
<s> Who are they?
<s> The who?
<s> It's suicide.
<s> But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
<s> I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
<s> Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
<s> I think it's absolutely charming.
<s> May I come to the map?
<s> No, thank you.
<s> Any cannon?
<s> The numbers are not particularly relevant.  You are not up against soldiers -- this is a mob, and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant.
<s> But who made this treaty?
<s> I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
<s> Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
<s> Ajaccio.
<s> I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
<s> That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
<s> At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
<s> It is the work of incendiaries.
<s> Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!
<s> Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.
<s> I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
<s> My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
<s> Lisette.
<s> Lisette La Croix.
<s> Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
<s> No...
<s> I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness.  And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.
<s> I am afraid, then, I have to ask you both, Joseph as my brother, and Junot as my good friend, whether or not you know anything about this, or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it.
<s> There's probably some explanation.
<s> Why not?
<s> About Hippolyte Charles.
<s> God help me -- yes.
<s> My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
<s> Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
<s> I did not ask her to go to war against me.
<s> Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech.  Now, I order you to come down from the cart.
<s> Life is a burden for me.  Nothing gives me any pleasure; I find only sadness in everything around me.  It is very difficult because the ways of those with whom I live, and probably always shall live, are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight.
<s> Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
<s> Cheeco.
<s> Naw, them dudes is assholes.  Especially that dog - Cheeco.  Watch this little ass, he's sneaky.  Plus, I got something better than a Cadillac.
<s> Yeah, I'm alright.  Is my face still orange to you?
<s> Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!
<s> D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
<s> That ain't gonna work.
<s> That pump was full of money.  I saw where they put it.  Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it.
<s> Hell yeah, I remember you.
<s> I'm sorry to hear that.
<s> Bullshit!  I'll go postal in this mothafucka!
<s> I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week.  I thought that was it.
<s> Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
<s> Let it go, Roach, trust me.
<s> Let it go!
<s> Are you out your mind?  I'm not messing with them S.A.'s boy.  You must be crazy.
<s> Go for it.
<s> And some rolling papers.
<s> He's a boy, dude.
<s> Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
<s> Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot for this community.  By letting us go, you can improve black and brown relations.
<s> Good, let's get out.
<s> I'll take you later.
<s> Nothing.  What you want?
<s> Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby!  This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent.  Ain't that right, nephew?
<s> I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
<s> I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.
<s> For what?  We ain't gonna have no house after the auction tomorrow!
<s> What happened here?
<s> What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
<s> I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
<s> And your husband works for somebody else.
<s> I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
<s> Indeed.
<s> How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone?
<s> You know what I'm gonna do.
<s> No, that's,..that's fine
<s> Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
<s> On TV.
<s> I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
<s> What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
<s> Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change?  You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?
<s> What!?
<s> I don't want my windshield cleaned.
<s> It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
<s> You're going to deny me a lousy dollar after I've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?
<s> What?
<s> No, I didn't. I confiscated it. There's a difference.
<s> Laughs.
<s> Why?
<s> Yeah.
<s> You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control.
<s> Nah.  Hates his wife.
<s> I kill her anyway.
<s> Go ahead, sugar Die.
<s> How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
<s> Not even her?
<s> I will guard Pearl with my life...
<s> It's more fun hearin' stories in the dark.
<s> You have all sinned!
<s> But which one of you can say as I can say: I drove a good man to murder because I kept a-houndin' him for clothes and per-fumes and face paint!
<s> Yes! Yes!
<s> How do you mean?
<s> Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
<s> You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
<s> Come on!
<s> John don't like him much.
<s> Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
<s> She lieth in wait as for a prey. And increaseth the transgressors among men.
<s> Amen.
<s> Who's them Blue Men yonder?
<s> Sshhh...
<s> Hm?
<s> John! Don't!
<s> Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
<s> That's Daddy!
<s> He ain't my Dad.
<s> Getting Pearl to bed. I --
<s> No. No one never did.
<s> She turned me out of the bed.
<s> Well, John, the night before your father died, he told me what he did with that money.
<s> Ben never told you he throwed it in the river? Did he?
<s> How'do.
<s> The Drugstore?
<s> What?
<s> No, nothing.
<s> I sure as hell hope so.
<s> Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
<s> Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
<s> They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
<s> I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
<s> My dream.
<s> It so happens I work here, and there's an unsolved murder. I don't like unsolved murders, especially ones my daughter's mixed up in -- what are you doing here at this hour? You're supposed to be getting some sleep.
<s> Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!  Hey! We got a fire!
<s> I'd've canned your ass if you hadn't. What you got?
<s> Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
<s> School.
<s> But that's just not reality, Nancy!
<s> Dead and gone.
<s> I don't even have it on me, so forget it.
<s> Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
<s> A few friends... just a little dinner party.
<s> I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
<s> I have nothing to hide.
<s> I see.
<s> Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
<s> What was it like?
<s> Evening gown?
<s> He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
<s> Or it might be the firing squad!
<s> ...des raisins de Madère, des framboises... 
<s> But what can we do?... We have to accept.
<s> What is it?
<s> Yes, he looks like a comrade!
<s> How many families live here with you?
<s> Which part of the room is mine?
<s> Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut, Buljanoff? You all look so wintry, Comrades. And why do we always keep the windows closed?  Isn't it amazing, at home there's still snow and ice and here... Look at the birds. I always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. Now I know why. We have the high ideal but they have the climate... well, Comrades, I don't think I need you any more.
<s> Go to bed.
<s> If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
<s> No, sir.
<s> Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
<s> Count d'Algout...
<s> Oh, Leon, you are so good.
<s> It's a real Paris reunion.
<s> I'll send you a muff.
<s> A cow?
<s> Just three people in a room this size? Whew!
<s> Look for yourselves.
<s> Buljanoff, she still has those old- fashioned Bolshevik ideas.
<s> You mean you are deserting Russia?
<s> Just looking around.
<s> Monsieur.
<s> Leon, Leonitchka, she is not going to negotiate! She is going to fight that injunction. She's going to make a precedent of it!
<s> She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
<s> We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
<s> She has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. We would appreciate if you would see to it yourself.
<s> What business?
<s> So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
<s> Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
<s> No.
<s> You're welcome.
<s> You might hold this for me.
<s> I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
<s> You must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles... It glitters!
<s> Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
<s> Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.
<s> I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...
<s> You know I want to...
<s> I don't like your following me.
<s> What are you after?
<s> What?
<s> Why?
<s> Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr. McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs. McIntosh?"...
<s> Foolish? If this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself I would follow it from one end of Paris to the other, and when I caught up with it I would say, "Just a moment, you charming little dress, I want you to meet Ninotchka... you two were meant for each other." Ninotchka feels more comfortable.
<s> I promise... I swear.
<s> My darling.
<s> There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast.  To us, Ninotchka!
<s> And General Savitzky.
<s> A funny story?
<s> Comrades! Good people of France!
<s> Right: Lovers of the world unite!
<s> No! No!
<s> Well, it has to warm up... you have to give it a chance... just like people... like you and me... first you wanted to fight me and now we belong to the same party... salute!
<s> Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.
<s> Huh?
<s> No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...
<s> Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
<s> It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
<s> How do you do?
<s> I'm going, Leon...  but before I leave I must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year?
<s> This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen.
<s> There are a hundred ways to approach it, but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I'm in love, Swana.
<s> I'm afraid that's what it is.
<s> If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd?
<s> Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
<s> Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
<s> That's no business... that's a social injustice.
<s> Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Raw carrots and beets.
<s> Can you recommend a restaurant?
<s> Where is that?
<s> My jewels?!
<s> Why do you bring this up after so many years?
<s> So ... let's go ...
<s> Frankly, sir, it stinks.  I have no access.  I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff.
<s> That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
<s> Son of a bitch.
<s> It's the fall of the Roman Empire, are you blind?  And we're putting fig leaves on the statues ...
<s> Yeah, I knew it.  I knew it from '69 on, and I said it all along, didn't I ...
<s> Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
<s> I thought the gloves were off.
<s> No, no.  He's our only "star" right now.  He'd go crying straight to the press.  He'd crucify us -- the sonofabitch!  Get someone from our staff on his ass. Tap his phones.  I want to know everyone he talks to.
<s> You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
<s> Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena?
<s> Cox!  Fire him.
<s> The hell he will!  Fire him, too.  If you have to go all the way down to the janitor at the Justice Department, fire the sonofabitch!  And ...
<s> I'm afraid we have another problem, Mr. President.
<s> It's totally out of context.  I was protecting the national security.  I never intended --
<s> Yes, you approved it, sir.
<s> It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke.  They went in to get his psychiatric records.
<s> What do you mean, sir?
<s> "Security" is not strong enough.
<s> No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old.  And for God's sake, keep Colson out.  It's time to baptize our young counsel.  That means Dean can never talk about it.  Attorney-client privilege.  Get to it.  And Dean -- you stay close on this.
<s> He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself.
<s> You never told him?
<s> Money.  Follow the money.
<s> Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
<s> It's okay, Bob, we're just rapping, my friends and I.  We actually agree on a lot of things ...
<s> Let him finish, Bob.
<s> What about the documents he promised?
<s> What about happiness, Mother?
<s> Harold ... can I get you anything?
<s> I didn't choose him as my deputy, Mr. President.  You did.
<s> Screw congressional oversight.  I know damn well, going back to the '50's, this agency reports what it wants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know.  Pay close attention to this.
<s> I'm interested in the documents that put your people together with ... the others.  All of them ...
<s> I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
<s> Yes.
<s> He's lying, Clyde.  Always has. That's why Nixon's always been useful. Hold still.  And take your hand off your hip.
<s> Would you walk with me down to the paddock?  I'd like to look at the horses for the eighth.
<s> It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can assure you.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
<s> Remember what Lenin said in 1917, Mr. President: "The power was lying in the streets just waiting for someone to pick it up."  The Communists have never been closer.  Now is the time to go back to the old themes, the ones that made you president.  Let the Communists know you're onto them.
<s> Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.
<s> It won't.  As long as I'm here.
<s> The White House.
<s> A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
<s> We'll see about that.
<s> What do you mean, Jack?
<s> There's no other choice.
<s> Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is my contention.
<s> Jews and Negros don't win elections, Henry.  Better to hang them around the Democrats' necks.
<s> I had nothing to do with that, sir, and I resent any implication ...
<s> Don't be stupid.  The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways.  You're the only friend I've got, Henry.
<s> Yes, Mr. President.
<s> I was the lesser of two evils.
<s> Kissinger's misunderstood.  He pretends to be a liberal for his Establishment friends, but he's even tougher than I am ...
<s> Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
<s> The Jewboy's a Harvard whore with the morals of an eel -- sells himself to the highest bidder.
<s> Sure, I'd like to offer condolences.
<s> Mr. Nixon.
<s> Syracuse.
<s> I like jazz ...
<s> And we got the "big mo"!  We're back!
<s> The hell with 'em.
<s> Well, we could delete it.
<s> You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
<s> It's over, Dick.
<s> He doesn't want me at the funeral.
<s> No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
<s> We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ...
<s> And then you'll be happy?
<s> Can I just ask for one thing?
<s> I asked him, "Lyndon, what would you do, on a scale of one to ten?"  And he said, "Bomb the shit out of Hanoi, boy!  Bomb them where they live." ... John, do you think I was too soft on TV?
<s> I've missed you.
<s> I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
<s> Then what are you scared of, honey?
<s> How am I going to break this to Bob Hope?
<s> When?
<s> You.  What' you're doing --
<s> No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
<s> No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
<s> Who else'd be in your truck.
<s> I deduced it. Once you walked in.
<s> All the time you spend tryin' to get back what's been took from you there's more goin' out the door. After a while you just try and get a tourniquet on it.
<s> It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
<s> Oh yes.
<s> I don't know. My mind wanders.
<s> Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
<s> It could be.
<s> You sure?
<s> I'm hidin' behind you.
<s> I'm ahead of you there.
<s> Wasn't no bullet.
<s> You want me to wait til you've quit the building?
<s> It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
<s> Okay.
<s> I can't plan your day.
<s> Okay. Two of 'em. Both had my father. It's peculiar. I'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night.
<s> No. But I gave my word.
<s> Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself.
<s> I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen.
<s> Yes. Things fall into place.
<s> At the gettin' place.
<s> Just keep it up.
<s> Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.
<s> Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home.
<s> C'mon, pack your things. Anything you leave you ain't gonna see again.
<s> Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
<s> Yes I do.
<s> You should be used to that.
<s> Hey.
<s> No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you.
<s> I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
<s> Where does he work?
<s> Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.
<s> Huh? Airport or airstrip?
<s> Well -- where ya goin'?
<s> Why would I care where you're going.
<s> I seen you was from Dallas.
<s> I didn't mean nothin' by it.
<s> Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything?
<s> I could come back then.
<s> You live in that house behind the store?
<s> You've lived here all your life?
<s> Call it?
<s> You stand to win everything. Call it.
<s> Uh-huh. Double ought.
<s> No sir, it's unusual.
<s> If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
<s> How well do you know Chigurh.
<s> That's not an answer.
<s> Okay. We can stop that.
<s> You want to change rooms?
<s> You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty.  It ain't took.
<s> Not any way.
<s> I didn't say braze.
<s> What did I say?
<s> To kill your wife.
<s> You do, I reckon.
<s> No sir.
<s> Well, you should find out. She keeps talking about them...
<s> Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
<s> Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
<s> Little place called "Williams," why?
<s> Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
<s> WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!
<s> This is really awkward...
<s> ...what're you saying?
<s> I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
<s> I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
<s> He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
<s> I take it I should. I'm sorry.
<s> The day I left you I just drove and drove. I drove all day and all that night, and I didn't go anywhere. I just kept driving. I stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and I sat --
<s> Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
<s> She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
<s> Didn't I?
<s> I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
<s> Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
<s> I got you, Del...
<s> Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
<s> Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
<s> Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
<s> You mean... George McCord, the actor?
<s> ...did I win some contest?
<s> LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S DEAD!
<s> I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
<s> 'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
<s> No, that's not, I couldn't...
<s> Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
<s> Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
<s> He has a wife?!
<s> Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
<s> How many men have I talked to?
<s> Shhh! I heard you the first time.
<s> Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
<s> To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
<s> Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
<s> No, you're not. You're a good doctor, Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell. I've made my decision. Now, if you'll excuse me...
<s> I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
<s> Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> "Injuns?"
<s> I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
<s> Then do as you're told. Get her back.
<s> Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college.
<s> Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
<s> David Ravell.
<s> I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
<s> No doubt, brother - I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.
<s> Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn -
<s> The law. Well the law is a human institution.
<s> That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
<s> Good Lord, what do we do?
<s> Don't know, Delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin' for their lack of sight, even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers. Now clearly, seein' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery. It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-
<s> What're you gonna do with your share of the treasure, Pete?
<s> Where's Tommy?
<s> Okay, Everett.
<s> Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias.
<s> I never knocked over any armored- car. I was sent up for practicing law without a license.
<s> Oh my God!
<s> Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
<s> Well, it's a well-run campaign, midget'n broom'n whatnot.
<s> Reason why he's pullin' ah pants down.
<s> Wipin' little circles with his bread...
<s> Well sure, honey, but...
<s> Don't I know it.
<s> Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash.
<s> For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.
<s> Aw, that's all right.
<s> I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.
<s> How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
<s> Well he's the reform candidate, Daddy.
<s> You got a maiden name, Daddy?
<s> I been calling for four months.
<s> Yes, Joe.
<s> Not exactly, sir.
<s> Yes, sir!
<s> Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out!
<s> Yes, sir!
<s> I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
<s> Well, goodbye.
<s> No, sir.
<s> Zack, don't!
<s> I said, come here!
<s> Yes, ma'am. Four long, hard weeks of sacrifice for my country... for my people... for you. But I survived.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
<s> Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
<s> What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
<s> We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
<s> Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
<s> No. I never feel like that.
<s> You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
<s> Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please.
<s> Of course. I don't want no Okie from Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles.
<s> Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
<s> Not me.
<s> You're a very pretty girl, Paula.
<s> My kinda group!
<s> Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
<s> To have a good time with you until you have to go.
<s> Any time, sailor.
<s> God.
<s> Are those for me?
<s> Shhhh...
<s> Yeah.
<s> But she expects you to marry her?
<s> But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
<s> A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.
<s> God.
<s> Who else but God could think this shit up?  I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in.  God, man, He just loves the irony.
<s> Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.
<s> I don't know, she keeps screamin' the same thing over and over.
<s> Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.
<s> She better.
<s> You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
<s> We've got the Kid!  WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck is she thinking?!
<s> Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
<s> Different tables.
<s> Okay, fuckball, you think.  What are we gonna do?
<s> She lied.  Cops woulda been here by now if she called 'em.  Besides, Junior cut the phones.
<s> Adios.
<s> I don't get it.
<s> Oh, that phone call...
<s> Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
<s> I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
<s> This is it?  I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce that here.
<s> 0150.
<s> Wait.
<s> Feel okay?
<s> Little bit.  Yeah.
<s> What am I, a five year old?
<s> I am.  I'm here.
<s> I was trying not to tell you...
<s> What?!? Don't tell me you're buying this?
<s> Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.
<s> I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
<s> Yeah, it's me.
<s> Who fucking cares? You cops killed Cy. And before you bastards kill anyone else, I'll give you your fucking set up. That make you happy??!!
<s> You know that's bullshit.
<s> Man, fuck you!!!
<s> No, Panther Headquarters.  Least that way we could hang out more like we used to.
<s> N... N...... Not... Oh.
<s> That would be an excellent start.  Tell him to keep a low profile.
<s> Neither your stomach or your opinion matters here Dorsett... What matters is that Mr. Trafficante and the Bureau have come up with a solution to our Panther Problem. One might say...The Final Solution.
<s> Yeah, but aligning with white organizations. I'm not sure now's the time.
<s> From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
<s> Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
<s> Black people getting uppity, feeding their children breakfast, taking their destiny into their own hands. What's this world coming to?
<s> A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
<s> Right on Brother Judge...
<s> What, I don't know how you mean?
<s> Chickenshits, they're grabbing at anything.
<s> Brimmer.
<s> Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
<s> Just a kid.
<s> Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge? 
<s> Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.
<s> Where is he?.
<s> No... wait, there's something else, something weird. I hear he's set up down at that warehouse on fifty deuce. He's talking big and living bigger.
<s> I don't know. I really don't.
<s> Uh... uh... I...
<s> That would be nice, too.
<s> I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
<s> He's not making light.
<s> Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier.  It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.
<s> Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
<s> Oh?
<s> Very well, proceed, sir.
<s> Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
<s> You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back.
<s> If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
<s> It's already over.
<s> He tried.  It didn't take.
<s> If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
<s> We're low on salt.  I should go to Pembroke and get some.
<s> Everyone knows.  It's what made me a hero.  Me, Harry Lee, all of us.  I got a medal.  Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes.  Everyone knows what happened.
<s> I don't care.  I hate him.
<s> It's Mister Marion.
<s> Harry, Harry, Harry...
<s> There's nothing you could have done, Gates is a damned fool.
<s> That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
<s> Four, five miles.
<s> But what about Thomas?
<s> Earned.
<s> Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
<s> Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
<s> Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
<s> Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
<s> Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair.
<s> Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary.
<s> That's enough, Ellen.
<s> No more chocolate chip cookies.
<s> You believe in it.
<s> Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
<s> Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah!
<s> The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis.
<s> Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
<s> Yes.
<s> The place we're going is on the other side of that.
<s> Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
<s> No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
<s> Wendigo?
<s> The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know.
<s> Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
<s> Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
<s> Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
<s> Eh?  You have my word, then -- on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul.
<s> He didn't waste it.
<s> No.  But him I believe.  He us genuinely angry.
<s> I want you to leave.  And never come back.
<s> My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
<s> Thank you, sir.
<s> Then I can wear men's clothing.
<s> Well, I am not going to stay hidden in some cabin, or I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage!
<s> Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
<s> Ceremony?
<s> I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
<s> About the day we met. Do you remember?
<s> Parlay!  I invoke the right of parlay!  According to the Code of the Brethern, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!
<s> -- then we never would have met.
<s> Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
<s> Me!
<s> No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.
<s> Not when you can drink instead, at least.
<s> You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.
<s> We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.
<s> To the Black Pearl.
<s> One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels. Two --
<s> First -- have you found me a crew?
<s> We're not going to just surrender!
<s> I don't think that will be necessary.
<s> Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
<s> I'll be at the wheel myself.
<s> Somewhat.
<s> Aye!  Avast!
<s> I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
<s> Don't worry.  I've already got a Quartermaster -- there!
<s> Depends.
<s> My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner.  His blood runs in my veins.  You need my blood.  And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!
<s> The Black Pearl is a real ship.
<s> Yes it is.  I've seen it.
<s> ... no.
<s> Until he's done.
<s> Have you found Dr. Bright?
<s> Susan, I sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in.  I ask that you keep in mind that I am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what I want.
<s> You egomaniacs make me laugh. Nature's going to bury you like she buries everyone else.
<s> She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.
<s> In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
<s> No, Icky, this is real.
<s> I promise, my dear, I will give the matter some consideration.
<s> I'm so excited, Icarus.
<s> Cleaned up?  It can't be cleaned up! Without the nanobot the waste can't be stabilized!  That's what we've been trying to tell you!  The only thing we can do is run!  Run!  Run!
<s> Look, John, nobody wants to find out what happens.  That's why you're here.  We need your help on this one and that's why that suitcase is here.
<s> The trunk.
<s> Yeah.  But it wasn't a group.  It was one man.
<s> Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
<s> Who isn't?
<s> You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
<s> And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
<s> I guess I should be flattered.
<s> That's right.
<s> What about it!
<s> I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
<s> Probably the caffeine.
<s> I don't know.
<s> You didn't think I could just leave you?
<s> Let's go.
<s> Yes.
<s> I remember I was trying to help...
<s> That's right.
<s> The question is, are you?
<s> It's a miracle.
<s> Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
<s> Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
<s> Well, maybe it's a bit heavy for you. Perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romance—
<s> I'm glad.
<s> Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
<s> When 'we' . . .?  You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?
<s> Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough?  What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
<s> Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live—
<s> Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters!
<s> Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
<s> I poisoned him.
<s> Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening—
<s> I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
<s> Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
<s> Hey, make up your mind, will you?
<s> A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "Just A Gigolo . . . "
<s> No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Your valet, sir.
<s> Drunk, sir?
<s> Oh no, sir!
<s> Thank you, sir.
<s> I beg your pardon, sir?
<s> That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
<s> Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
<s> No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
<s> Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
<s> Never even been to New Madrid.
<s> And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
<s> You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
<s> Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
<s> There's nothing sudden about that—  He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you.
<s> I have it here.
<s> Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He never saw fifty dollars before. You could have bought him for six bits. Funny thing about Bingy. The more he gets - the more he prints. He looks stupid, doesn't he? But oh how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter.
<s> Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
<s> Smythe, come here. I want to talk to you.  Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this house! This big . . . come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, what's the matter with you?
<s> Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
<s> Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?
<s> Very good, sir.
<s> Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?
<s> It can't be possible.
<s> I can't go out there. How can I go out there?
<s> Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
<s> I think ... I might be ill ...
<s> She won't go out with me?
<s> That's not going to happen!
<s> I really don't know.  Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
<s> Very well ...
<s> Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for this.
<s> Get lost!
<s> What's going to happen?
<s> Just take deep breaths.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen ...
<s> That's great.
<s> I told you. I'm like positive.
<s> What?
<s> Yeah ... You don't have rain either?
<s> Scout?
<s> What department store did they go to?
<s> But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
<s> Re-runs?
<s> Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
<s> A deluge doesn't just "happen." Bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ...  You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ...
<s> I didn't do anything wrong.
<s> Why?
<s> I'm going on trial tomorrow?
<s> Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...
<s> Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
<s> Forget about that!
<s> What's the rush?
<s> Hey.
<s> Yeah ... Saw you too.
<s> So you can't talk to me?
<s> Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
<s> And what was this?
<s> Ok. Thank you.
<s> I'm just stopping by to say hello.
<s> So you're coming tonight, right?
<s> She's really cute and she's really nice.
<s> Did I say that?
<s> I feel really on the spot now.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
<s> Yeah? So what are you doing, then?
<s> I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
<s> No.
<s> It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
<s> Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
<s> I have to go.
<s> It's fine. It was fun, though.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Ok.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> If you come to Hawaii --
<s> Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....
<s> I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
<s> You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
<s> Yeah......yeah.....
<s> This is funny.
<s> I'm fine are you ok?
<s> If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
<s> Well who did?
<s> Hello, how are you?
<s> I wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> It takes time to process --
<s> I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
<s> You're goin' on a trip?
<s> Where you goin?
<s> Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
<s> Ok.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Wait a minute --
<s> You have another house somewhere or something?
<s> You know, please, I just wanna say that I didn't say I would help her out; I was very clear about it....I don't think that this is fair.....wait, wait, wait, ouch, ouch.....
<s> What is this, man?
<s> Well....what do you want, then?
<s> Are you going to the party tonight?
<s> What are you doing?
<s> Right now, you're doing nothing?
<s> Seriously.
<s> I'm only paying two of you guys.
<s> Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --
<s> Ok.
<s> I'm sorry. You're right.
<s> Ok.
<s> It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
<s> My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
<s> We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
<s> Once or twice.
<s> I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think.
<s> Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
<s> Why not?
<s> You'll hate me now, won't you?
<s> You needn't worry, Valcour. It's administrative, nothing more.
<s> I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
<s> It's not even a proper novel! It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not to mention the endless repetition of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff" --
<s> One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
<s> You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --
<s> That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
<s> That's enough.
<s> Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
<s> I hope you'll judge him by his progress here, and not his past reputation.
<s> His wife's influence.
<s> Do you favor its publication?
<s> Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?
<s> A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.
<s> That's not our intent --
<s> What could cause a tincture like this?
<s> Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
<s> Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy.
<s> Don't start --
<s> You're far crueler than I, my sweet.
<s> How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
<s> Go on, child.
<s> I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
<s> ....shame on you, truly...
<s> But it's just begun --
<s> She knew what she was signing on for After all, she took the money.
<s> Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
<s> You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
<s> So I've been told.
<s> Do you?
<s> Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee of the master.
<s> Don't
<s> One . . . buys things.
<s> I will not defend my life to you--
<s> I will not have this in my home.
<s> No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
<s> How so?
<s> Thank you, sir. She begins to leave
<s> Huh?
<s> We're using-
<s> Uh-huh
<s> Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
<s> Oh for God's sake, Louella-
<s> Telling stories.
<s> Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
<s> Kid, you just got your ass kicked on Joseph Conrad and now you're gonna go to Schaefer and tell him you wanna do the id and the superego? Stop being so goddamn smart.
<s> So speaks the court jester.
<s> It's too late. The movie's made
<s> This ain't George's doing--!
<s> I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important to me b-b-because I don't want anyone t-t-to, um, know that--
<s> That's for me to decide.
<s> We already made the same offer to the stockholders.
<s> Please don't ask me to do this.
<s> Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
<s> I really think you're
<s> The Palace in New York. But Orson there's something else.
<s> I don't want to sit
<s> It was fun, wasn't it?
<s> Yes!
<s> For what?
<s> Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
<s> No, I can't wait. You know when I wait? When it's important to wait. It's not important to wait for no steak. It's important to wait for Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't important to wait for no steak! I won that fight. So, I stayed in the ring, and that way I made sure everybody knew it. I shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch.
<s> I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
<s> Hit me in the face.
<s> Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
<s> Give me a chance. Let me look.
<s> I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to win. I've done a lot of bad things. I dunno...
<s> No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.
<s> Where you been?
<s> Well, that's what I mean.
<s> Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
<s> When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
<s> So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
<s> So what?
<s> Does that mean...
<s> At night?
<s> It feels real good.
<s> Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
<s> What?
<s> Yeah, what?
<s> What're you talking about?
<s> Do I have to kill you, eh?  Do I have to kill somebody to get an answer?  I know about you at the Copa. I know all about it.
<s> Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
<s> I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
<s> Don't make no difference no more.
<s> Jake, sit down for a minute.
<s> That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.
<s> Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
<s> I'll pull somebody out of Japan.
<s> But his leg!
<s> Well, officer -- do your duty.
<s> I'll bet it's been done.
<s> You think I made all this up?
<s> Not yet.
<s> Who left -- where?
<s> Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
<s> What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
<s> That depends on who "they" were.
<s> I told you that --
<s> Yeah. I sure feel sorry for you, Gunnison. Must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast another whole week.
<s> Indo-China. Got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning. The place is about to go up in smoke.
<s> I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.
<s> Gunnison?
<s> The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
<s> Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
<s> She expects me to marry her.
<s> It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
<s> Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
<s> No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
<s> Get back there! He'll see you!
<s> Look!
<s> You can tell that from here?
<s> Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
<s> When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont -- they'll even contribute.
<s> Without any future?
<s> Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
<s> You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?
<s> He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's --
<s> What about it?
<s> I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
<s> I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.
<s> I do?
<s> I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for a start?
<s> Is he cleaning house?
<s> And the last thing she'd leave behind would be her wedding ring!  Do you ever leave yours at home?
<s> Wanna make the colored lights go around and around?
<s> I'm glad they let you out.
<s> What?
<s> Jim Stark.
<s> Down in back.
<s> You still want to go home, Moose?
<s> Then shut your mouth before your guts run out!
<s> Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we?
<s> And you dropped it?
<s> Yes.
<s> Listen--nobody should make a snap decision--This isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons--
<s> Well--
<s> Will you wait a minute?
<s> You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom?
<s> That's right!
<s> What's that pounding?
<s> Look--just relax, will you?
<s> Stay here.  That was my son!
<s> My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
<s> I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?
<s> Yeah?
<s> I'm here.  Shut up.
<s> Shut up.  Are you nuts?
<s> Wow!  Well now-there-then!
<s> When was that?
<s> I'm here.
<s> Keep away from me!  I don't believe you anymore!
<s> Good Lord!
<s> What's that got to do with it?
<s> Big tough character.  You don't kid me, pal.  How come you're not wearing your boots?
<s> Leave me alone.
<s> I just get so--  Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY  Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.
<s> And they think they are protecting my by moving.
<s> She eats him alive and he takes it.
<s> Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
<s> Listen--
<s> Bully for you.
<s> You going there?
<s> They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?
<s> I'm numb.
<s> So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
<s> No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
<s> See, we're very modern.
<s> So do you.
<s> It is for me too.
<s> We have to go back!
<s> Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
<s> Hi.
<s> No.  I don't even know why I do it.
<s> You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
<s> No.  Why?
<s> I didn't want to stop.
<s> Gabriel, let him go --
<s> YES!!!
<s> I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play!
<s> To all those cons...
<s> We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
<s> One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
<s> Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree...
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yes it was all you --
<s> Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby.  So don't talk to me about little white lies.
<s> And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
<s> What the fuck is going on.
<s> Nick, what are you --
<s> Nick, I love you --
<s> You're in on this.
<s> Canada.
<s> But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.
<s> For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
<s> They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
<s> If he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working on it here.
<s> I'm glad it was me.
<s> Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna be working together here.  Get him back in the rig.
<s> A station wagon in Canada.
<s> We got faith in you, Nick Mason.  You're our inside man.
<s> And I worked there. For a year.
<s> Why not.
<s> Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!
<s> Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it hers.
<s> How'd you know my name...
<s> How'd you know my name was Rudy.
<s> How'd you know my name.
<s> Leave the tree.
<s> OPEN IT!!!
<s> We're aware of your position.
<s> Mr. Bangs.
<s> Acid-chewer.
<s> Five years. Since it opened.
<s> DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.
<s> Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
<s> GUARD!!!
<s> YOU TELL HER!
<s> I'M NOT NICK!
<s> Thanks, don't mind if I do.
<s> No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
<s> Was he all pissed off?
<s> I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
<s> Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.
<s> Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
<s> It's a change.
<s> A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
<s> Dead as Dillinger.
<s> How many employees?
<s> That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
<s> That's your proof?
<s> Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
<s> Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
<s> That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
<s> All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.
<s> Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
<s> Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
<s> Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.
<s> That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
<s> What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
<s> Where?
<s> I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed.
<s> I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.
<s> That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
<s> We can't take him to a hospital.
<s> Well, first things first, staying here's goofy. We gotta book up.
<s> You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
<s> I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
<s> But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
<s> I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
<s> You can stay here if you like.
<s> Like sticking his nose into other people's business.
<s> It's a long walk back to Aspen.
<s> The who?
<s> Go on. Tell me more about her.
<s> You're not going out to look for them?
<s> Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
<s> I don't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they don't want to leave.
<s> Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
<s> Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty- two's more your size.
<s> I won't again.
<s> Finished, son?
<s> Just the grub box and bed rolls.
<s> Kind of sore.
<s> All right, you didn't know.
<s> I'm sorry. Let's go.
<s> If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
<s> No. But it's mine and I didn't want anyone foolin' with it.
<s> Then why stay in the hills.
<s> Yeah.
<s> They went on like I told you.
<s> What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
<s> Thank you, Mr. Graham.
<s> That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
<s> Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
<s> How many ways can a man say no.
<s> Stop it --
<s> He can wait. Let's stay here until morning.
<s> Yeah, we sure have.
<s> Why not? You went farther than that last time.
<s> Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
<s> No.
<s> Would they be good to eat?
<s> Steve --
<s> Oh my god. Madam Elsa, my psychic, told me I would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today.
<s> You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?
<s> Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
<s> It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.
<s> Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
<s> Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.
<s> I'm sorry, Buddy. You seem really nice, but I'm just getting over a really bad relationship, and I'm not ready to start dating yet.
<s> Open chest!!!
<s> Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab.
<s> Huh?
<s> I know, but I've been thinking --
<s> Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
<s> What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
<s> I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago.
<s> I'm Hanson the caretaker.
<s> Thanks. I made them by hand.
<s> Gear. You know, clothing.
<s> Yeah, you feel that? Now put it all together.
<s> Uh, uh.
<s> Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.
<s> That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here.
<s> Theo, did you see the animal?
<s> There's something going on in this house. I'm not crazy.
<s> Let me see the files.
<s> Just a little experiment.
<s> Alright. Come on, you guys.
<s> How is she?
<s> Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  Did you bring my bag?
<s> Dog, you look hot.
<s> It says, "Ray."
<s> "Fucked me."
<s> Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
<s> No more violence... No more violence...
<s> MURDERED?!!
<s> It's a cool idea, Misty! Let's make a gore movie about Mom! Better yet, a TV series!
<s> I DO! Mom's gone crazy!
<s> Is there a killer loose?
<s> Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy.
<s> Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... 
<s> Well, honey, chickadees breed in Alaska, you know. No wonder Dede's hungry. It's a long trip all the way to Baltimore.
<s> Amen to that.  It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!
<s> It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey.
<s> Oh, honey!
<s> What a mess.
<s> ...People who don't mind their own business.
<s> I certainly did.
<s> Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
<s> GODDAMN YOU!
<s> NO I'M NOT, YOU MOTHER-FUCKER!
<s> Marvin A. Pickles.
<s> Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.
<s> ...Browsing.
<s> No...  I don't have room in my kitchen...
<s> Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
<s> You forgot something...
<s> Yes you are.
<s> We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!
<s> Yeah —- sure.
<s> Where?
<s> You could go and open the door.
<s> I did her hair.
<s> Why?
<s> Good.
<s> Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I think I can be more frank with you. I don't believe you. I still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale. It's like some of Jacqueline's stories.
<s> A poet. He's sitting right over there. That's his table —— the one at the feet of Dante.
<s> Gregory ——  you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
<s> Look here, just because Mrs. Romari asked you to amuse us.
<s> This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.
<s> I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
<s> I'm afraid.
<s> I won't get lonely.
<s> Yes.
<s> But it's a small room, Jason.
<s> Why not let your publisher judge that?
<s> Perhaps
<s> I'd like that.
<s> I always thought it was a more intimate relationship.
<s> We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
<s> Yes —— and I must say I've done very well with it -- perhaps even better than Jacqueline.
<s> This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
<s> I doubt if you'll get anything out of that woman. But if  you'd like to try, I'll advance you the money to make the trip to New York. Of course, my dear, if you don't find your sister, you can always come back here.
<s> Please.
<s> I can quote that too; "Those who shall go out into the market place and let their tongues speak of us, and give knowledge of our being and our deeds, whom-so-ever doeth this shall die."
<s> Television?
<s> Yeah, I guess it is. My mother is a complete Anglophile, anything British makes her drool like a baby. She probably heard the name in some movie. She's a prisoner of public television now.
<s> No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?
<s> Nine years.
<s> Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.
<s> Sister older or younger?
<s> Who's Elizabeth?
<s> How do you mean?
<s> Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
<s> Well, let me put it this way: I cannot achieve an erection while in the presence of another person. So, for all practical purposes, I am impotent.
<s> Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
<s> Basically, yes.
<s> The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
<s> Yes.
<s> I know.
<s> Yes.
<s> Why not?
<s> What difference does it make why I do it?
<s> What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
<s> Sometimes. Afterward.
<s> I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.
<s> So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
<s> Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
<s> But I don't understand --
<s> I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
<s> As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
<s> Yeah, you're right. But I never claimed to know everything like you, and have all these little theories. I'm still learning, I know that. But I don't feel like I've wasted time. If I had to go through my marriage to get to where I am right now, fine.
<s> Are you going to see Elizabeth while you're here?
<s> I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
<s> Yeah. Jeez, give me some credit.
<s> Yes!
<s> Not very often.
<s> The friend of John's that was staying at your house.
<s> Yes.
<s> I know, but this... I just feel like everybody I know right now is obsessed with sex.
<s> He doesn't have a phone.
<s> And... do whatever it is you do.
<s> Cynthia!
<s> Did he touch you?
<s> You are in trouble.
<s> I mean, I couldn't do that in front of John, even.
<s> Okay.
<s> You want me to leave?
<s> Well, I don't really listen to her when it comes to men. I mean, look at John, for crissake. Oh, you went to school with him didn't you? You're probably friends or something.
<s> Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
<s> Yes.
<s> Different.
<s> So make an exception.
<s> Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
<s> I want to see you.
<s> Cynthia. John.
<s> Nothing wrong with trying.
<s> Right.
<s> It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
<s> It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?
<s> You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
<s> By definition you're lying to Ann, too.
<s> I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him.
<s> I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
<s> It'll just be me.
<s> What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
<s> Really. How'd it go?
<s> Where are the tapes, Graham?
<s> I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the fucking nut. Now show me those tapes.
<s> I'm not going to give you my keys.
<s> Brian Kirkland, please.
<s> Hi. Want a drink?
<s> No, nothing.
<s> Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
<s> Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
<s> I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
<s> Down to the incinerator.
<s> Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
<s> You touch my spleen, Rollo.  And here all the time I was thinking -- if I ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's happy.
<s> Did I say anything?
<s> You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
<s> OK, Rog. See you at ten.
<s> Time to check with Flavors.
<s> I got it!  I got it!!!
<s> Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?
<s> Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
<s> He was a President.
<s> What are you trying to do?  Make Bert look like a fool?  He's made all the arrangements.
<s> I'M LOOKING FOR TRADE
<s> YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
<s> The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you.
<s> Who?
<s> Thanks Officer Park...Vance.
<s> YOUNG BLOOD
<s> No...couldn't I do this later?
<s> Of course.  He was in great danger of harming himself.
<s> Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
<s> YOU'RE NO GOOD
<s> WHAT A JOKE...
<s> In the old series we didn't have a convertible.
<s> No.
<s> Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
<s> I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
<s> I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
<s> Just seeing how you're doing. And, um, Mom and I were starting to look over the seating charts again, and we're wondering if you wanted Tony Levin to sit next to the Feldmans, or should he be at one of the singles tables?
<s> And?
<s> Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
<s> I'm good.
<s> Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
<s> Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
<s> Stephanie.
<s> Me too.
<s> And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.
<s> She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
<s> I'm working on it.
<s> And Lexapro, yes.
<s> Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
<s> What color is it supposed to be?
<s> I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
<s> So you're going to stop acting?
<s> Then it's a good thing.
<s> You know that chick?
<s> Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
<s> Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
<s> Count me out.
<s> Well, I've been doing some thinking.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Put me down, Jack.
<s> No.
<s> It's private.
<s> Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
<s> Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
<s> Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
<s> That's five clicks, Jackson.
<s> Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day.
<s> Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
<s> I'll pay for it.
<s> Why don't you come in?
<s> Back at you.
<s> I know. I love that.
<s> I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
<s> Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
<s> She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
<s> Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
<s> Well, nice to see you now.
<s> Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
<s> Victoria.
<s> Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
<s> Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
<s> See you over there, Miles.
<s> She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie.
<s> Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
<s> I just got divorced. Phyllis.
<s> It tastes old.
<s> Don't touch him.
<s> I heard them Morgan.
<s> I don't feel much.
<s> ...I will.
<s> I'm here.
<s> It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear...
<s> You want him coming in the house next time?
<s> That's right.
<s> I got him.
<s> That wasn't the answer you wanted?
<s> What time is it?
<s> The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
<s> Ray Reddy's house.
<s> Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
<s> From what?
<s> A mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. It's eleven now.  They're leaving. Beat.
<s> We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this.
<s> Don't do it.
<s> Who wrote this book?
<s> You're scaring your sister.
<s> I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.
<s> Yeah baby. I think someone did.
<s> What was the first thing?
<s> What book!
<s> I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> I just came out to say goodbye.
<s> Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.
<s> That's why I'm here.
<s> I haven't done anything.
<s> You got no idea what they were after?
<s> Which way do you mean?
<s> Yeah?
<s> I've got a job.
<s> She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
<s> Tomorrow we're going to town to straighten that out once and for all. The next day we'll be back here... farming. And these cattle better be gone.
<s> We got married just before this trip, so we could come out here and try the land. It's hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that.
<s> Believe it.
<s> Why?
<s> Half the gunslingers that drift into town turn up on our police force.
<s> What now?
<s> He is now.
<s> Oh, a guy who got run out of town...
<s> What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
<s> Really?
<s> We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
<s> You don't know?
<s> We'll handle that. He's careless.
<s> I heard that too.
<s> I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson straight.
<s> Cobb, you've got nothing I need.
<s> I run the place. What can I get you?
<s> I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
<s> No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll take you to her.
<s> I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two.
<s> It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
<s> I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
<s> You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
<s> Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
<s> Almost right.
<s> I don't know if that's going to happen.
<s> Thank you.  What did you think, Lainey?
<s> Not now.  She's emotional.  Her mother dies today.  Scene forty-two of "Good For Nothing".  It's not a good time.
<s> -- I can explain.
<s> I do?
<s> Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
<s> She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
<s> Exactly.  Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
<s> Hello, is this Elaine?
<s> I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
<s> No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky.  How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
<s> Yes, call me Simone.
<s> You don't secretly want the attention?
<s> Who are you really?
<s> Frank, you know as well as I do, living in a fish bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media...
<s> For you.  I want you to know, Simone appreciates you all working for scale.  But why am I thanking you? Simone can thank you herself.  She insisted on speaking with you before filming begins.  She's on the line now.
<s> Why not?
<s> -- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
<s> Simone!
<s> You do?
<s> I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
<s> Hello, sweetheart.
<s> I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're Viktor Taransky.
<s> Hello, Lainey.
<s> I do okay.  How about you?
<s> It's a yacht.
<s> Abduction?
<s> I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
<s> -- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
<s> Yes, I'd like that.
<s> But that's Simone's part.
<s> Good.
<s> Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.
<s> ... digitized.
<s> No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
<s> Thanks.
<s> No, just one.
<s> Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.
<s> I work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. I try to help them figure things out.
<s> Congratulations.
<s> You use needles?
<s> Next time I won't be scared of you.
<s> See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do have a question.
<s> What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
<s> Never mind.
<s> Yes.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Yes.
<s> Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone...
<s> I guess she did.
<s> You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Standing next to my window.
<s> Dead people.
<s> Cole, please stop.
<s> You're a stuttering Stanley!
<s> S-ssssstop it!
<s> It's our pleasure.
<s> Chuck E. who?
<s> J. C. Penny's?
<s> Bitch.
<s> Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.
<s> "-- an AXE!"
<s> "And a slash-slash there --"
<s> He's right. Nice guitar break.
<s> Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
<s> Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?!
<s> Amends...?
<s> Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
<s> Who? Us?!
<s> Who you callin' "boy?"
<s> Amen.
<s> Yeah?
<s> I said that's enough!
<s> Mmmm -- so can I...
<s> Don't you see? Whatever's going on... I'm part of it.
<s> You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
<s> Spider.
<s> Whatcha' doin'?
<s> I'll get Wally to show me sometime then.
<s> He tried to kill you, Starla.
<s> Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
<s> And this is mine.
<s> That's the mystery of the ages there, Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was, like, in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
<s> Think we should get up a search party, head in there?
<s> Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
<s> What?
<s> Brought you munchies.
<s> That's disrespectful.
<s> Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
<s> Grant, you're sick!
<s> What other stuff?
<s> And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
<s> You paying for the gas?
<s> Whaddya want to know? My sign?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
<s> How do you know?
<s> Weight Station.
<s> Maybe six months with good behavior.  One to five.
<s> You gotta admire the man's determination.
<s> No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
<s> Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.
<s> Two is one.  Listen, let's just stay on the odd channels and switch everytime. Start in the basement. Now, let's haul ass.
<s> If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl.
<s> What's your twenty?
<s> We're gone.
<s> I'll believe it when I see it.
<s> What's that, pardner?
<s> See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger.
<s> -- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
<s> So there are no guests staying on that floor?
<s> No, no, no. We've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
<s> Tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level.  Trust me, we won't any problems with the hotel staff. You show 'em your ID with the letters "F.B.I." in all caps and it's instant compliance. I've seen in happen a hundred times.
<s> All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
<s> Mortal.
<s> Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
<s> Mmm-hmm.
<s> I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry.
<s> I'm not doing cocaine.
<s> -- Fine, fuck, I got it... Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport.
<s> I sent Hugo, he should be there!
<s> That's already happened hoss. It's naive to think otherwise.
<s> Only if you really, truly mean it.
<s> Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
<s> I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
<s> -- and you're gonna feel altogether fucked, by me, if you don't handle this. I'm the one, does the face plant, this falls apart, not you.
<s> Israel's legal representation, the firm of Culpepper, Brody and Reed, which is currently the subject of a joint SEC and Treasury Department probe, were left holding the bag after he skipped bail. Over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day. Rupert Reed, one of the firm's partners, has learned of Israel's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of Jack Dupree to pick him up and return him to Las Vegas... that can't happen.  We have a Gulf Stream standing by at Reagan International to transport you two to Lake Tahoe.  It's very simple gentlemen. Valacchi, Fratiano, Gravano -- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of The La Cosa Nostra, than Buddy Israel.
<s> And you just figured that out?  The Swede isn't a hitman, is he? He's a surgeon. Sparazza didn't want Israel's heart for a trophy, he wanted it for a transplant... why?
<s> Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we --
<s> Nah, nuthin' on my end --
<s> -- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
<s> Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
<s> Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
<s> Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
<s> Bag this fucker Buzzy.
<s> 'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
<s> Not you. Some assholes on the elevator... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what? Why the fuck they call'm "working girls."
<s> Jus' keep doin' y'damage girl, keep these mafuckas off my as--
<s> He said that the shit could get hot, could get heavy... I said good.  'Cuz I got two of the hottest, heaviest bitches alive.
<s> Oh, that's a relief.
<s> I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?
<s> But I can't leave with you.  I won't make it.
<s> Yes.
<s> I'll be right back.
<s> I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.
<s> Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
<s> It's something.
<s> I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.
<s> I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
<s> For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me.  That's all I know right now.
<s> I'm disgusting.
<s> Then you won't make it.
<s> It's an experiment.
<s> You go ahead.  Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now.  Everything's a blur.  I like distinctions.
<s> Not too sure about that.
<s> Urdu and Hindi.
<s> That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?
<s> Claire, will you calm down?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular "marching band".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady --
<s> No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
<s> Do you dance?
<s> Pretty bad.
<s> It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy.
<s> Mike...?
<s> You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
<s> Too kinky.
<s> Unbelievably handsome.  You look fantastic in a suit.
<s> She bought it.
<s> Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
<s> I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.
<s> He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
<s> No, I need'm now!
<s> I just gotta talk to her, T.J.
<s> Does it make you... hard?
<s> No, sir...
<s> Is she injured?
<s> I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.
<s> That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
<s> I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
<s> Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire! It's pitch dark in here!  You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!
<s> I'm not lettin' no one go.
<s> Don't you fuckin' give orders to me...
<s> Shooting?
<s> You stop him?
<s> No…not really.
<s> Remember Little League?
<s> I know.
<s> Hm.  What a lump.
<s> Harry…
<s> Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
<s> Why home? The real world beckons, man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
<s> You're not half the idiot I am, Harry.
<s> Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
<s> Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
<s> Can I get a word in edgewise?
<s> Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
<s> Well...
<s> Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
<s> You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
<s> Hm.  Well, I like you, too.  I like your aunt.  I like your shoelaces. I like--
<s> Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
<s> Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
<s> Your records are older than you are.  Have you never heard of new wave?
<s> Yes.  Do you have a date?
<s> See?  You big dullard.
<s> It's fine.  Tell me what--
<s> Aunt May, what happened?
<s> How is he?
<s> Let's talk in the hall.
<s> Truth. Pure, eternal.  Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
<s> Actually, I got this spider bite…
<s> Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
<s> I don't think I'll be running into him.
<s> Yup.  Oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  Solid, solid novelty act.
<s> Forgive me if I don't feel too sympathetic right now.
<s> Phooey on that.
<s> Plenty.
<s> You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
<s> Then we shall all zalute Feldwebel von und zu Schulz! About face!
<s> There was that ammunition train in the depot at Frankfurt, see? So Dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb, see? Then he waits until the train starts moving out, see? And one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor, see? So he throws it, see, and three minutes later -- voom! See?
<s> Don't worry. He'll be all right.
<s> Coming up.
<s> No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
<s> Anybody here wanna double their bet?
<s> Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
<s> Why not?
<s> You ain't going to squeal this one, brother.
<s> You betcha. I said one of us is a stoolie. A dirty, stinkin' stoolie!
<s> Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
<s> No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
<s> I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
<s> He is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
<s> I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
<s> Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
<s> Let me go!
<s> It's beautiful!  You goin' to eat it all yourself?
<s> So it is from the finance company. So it's better than no letter at all. So they want the third payment on the Plymouth.  So they want the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh. So they want the Plymouth.
<s> I'll open mine, too.
<s> It's that song, Harry!
<s> Why, sure!
<s> Animal! Animal! Wake up!
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.
<s> Good.
<s> Because that's where he is. In the water tank.
<s> Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
<s> One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
<s> Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?
<s> A little weak today.
<s> With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
<s> Sure I heard it. I still got one good ear.
<s> That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
<s> You did!
<s> Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.  Let's have that civilian stuff.
<s> Thirty-fifth.
<s> Where. Up Joey's ocarina. Didn't you know?
<s> Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
<s> Ach, terrible! Such foolish boys. Such nice boys. I'd better not talk about it. It makes me sick to my stomach.
<s> How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
<s> Who's the guy, Schulz?
<s> Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
<s> Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
<s> He is.
<s> I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!
<s> Full disruptors.
<s> Sorry, Captain. The ribbon has already entered the galaxy. It will pass through this sector in approximately thirty-one hours.
<s> Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
<s> It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
<s> The station complement was nineteen.
<s> The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
<s> I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
<s> You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
<s> She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
<s> I hadn't planned on it.
<s> Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
<s> I've warned ye about that back of yours. You should have a doctor take a look at it.
<s> It's like you always said- if something's important enough, you make the time.
<s> Phasing? To where?
<s> I thought you might.
<s> A photon torpedo?
<s> Where are the deflector relays?
<s> Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
<s> You want me to contact Starfleet?
<s> My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
<s> Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
<s> Not if it means killing over two hundred million people.  I wonder, did your wife Leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder?
<s> Time has no meaning there. The predator has no teeth.
<s> Thank you.
<s> And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
<s> Execute!
<s> Put me on the hailing frequency.
<s> Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us.
<s> Keep trying, Chekov. At regular intervals.
<s> Could be Grissom.  Patch in the hailing frequency.  U.S.S. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Come in, please.
<s> Wait a minute...! We don't know what we're talking about here...
<s> Locate.
<s> What is it?
<s> Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
<s> Not exactly.
<s> Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
<s> I know, but -- let's do it by the book. Stand by on this channel.  Go.
<s> Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
<s> Aye, sir!
<s> They've knocked out the damn automation center.  I've got no control over anything!
<s> Yes. And I know you.
<s> About a dozen officers and men.
<s> Come on!
<s> It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
<s> That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd <U>stay</U> there... They say it's exhaustion...  We'll see.
<s> Genesis?! Whatever for?
<s> 
<s> All right, damn you! All right!  Give me a minute to inform my crew.
<s> He would not have spoken of it openly.
<s> ... Yes...
<s> ... The needs of the few...
<s> Yes... But -- how...?
<s> But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
<s> Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
<s> Success, my lord.
<s> I trust my instincts.  Admiral Kirk. This is your opponent speaking.
<s> I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
<s> That's all you have to say?
<s> Amazing! I don't know what to say --
<s> I have my orders.
<s> I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.
<s> Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
<s> Carol!
<s> Is that a poem?
<s> Maybe...
<s> But we can't just sit here -- !
<s> What do you want with us? I demand --
<s> How soon --
<s> Let them eat static.
<s> <u>Full power damn you</u>!
<s> I shall avenge you --
<s> I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
<s> Spock?
<s> Scotty, let's have it.
<s> We'll beam aboard. Alert transporter room --
<s> All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power.
<s> Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
<s> Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
<s> Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?
<s> The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
<s> Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
<s> I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
<s> Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.
<s> Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...
<s> Or the one.
<s> It is still regulation, Admiral.
<s> Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
<s> If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
<s> Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son --
<s> I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.
<s> Stop engines.
<s> I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
<s> I'll try, Captain.
<s> Aft thrusters, sir.
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
<s> Gillian --
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Spock, start your computations for time warp.  Come on, Bones. Let's pay Scotty a visit.
<s> -- That's the general idea.
<s> Captain Spock and I will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
<s> Cramps.
<s> A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
<s> Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.
<s> I liked him better before he died.
<s> ... Best shot...?
<s> How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
<s> I have the coordinates of the reactor...
<s> Mr. Sulu, switch to manual control!
<s> Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!
<s> Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
<s> Go ahead.
<s> Noon tomorrow...?!
<s> Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...
<s> They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
<s> Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
<s> All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz.
<s> You need me.
<s> Permission granted.
<s> Well, I... find that understandable  I mean, you've been through a lot.  Station, please.
<s> The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
<s> Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
<s> You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.
<s> Thank you, Spock.
<s> Right.  Will you help us?
<s> Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
<s> Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
<s> Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!
<s> Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
<s> Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand by de-cloaking -- Scotty, ready for power build up!  Mark, Mr. Sulu...
<s> Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
<s> Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
<s> I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
<s> Humpbacked - people.?
<s> Sorry, sir. We can't even do that in the 23rd Century.
<s> Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
<s> Mr. Sulu?
<s> How long, Scotty?
<s> Don't take too long. We're sitting ducks for their radar systems...  Mr. Sulu, impulse climb.
<s> No power to the bay doors.
<s> It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
<s> Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?
<s> They are my friends.
<s> Sulu Hikaru.
<s> Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...?
<s> It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.
<s> This way!
<s> I thought it might begin the healing process.
<s> No one's ever asked me that before.
<s> Tournel will take you the rest of the way...
<s> No.
<s> The artificial lifeform was right?
<s> Are they in any danger?
<s> What's the last thing you remember, Data...
<s> It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
<s> Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
<s> Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?
<s> If you begin the procedure while the planet is still populated, the Federation will pursue you until...
<s> ... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
<s> This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
<s> You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
<s> Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected.
<s> ... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
<s> The Ba'ku.
<s> Do you have everything you need from command?
<s> Fail-safe?
<s> So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
<s> Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.
<s> Eject the core.
<s> Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters.
<s> We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
<s> So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about?
<s> Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
<s> Transferring controls to manual.
<s> Very well. We'll take an hour. Break out some rations...
<s> Can you beam him off?
<s> Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...
<s> What are they interested in...?
<s> What...?
<s> Got a minute? I... need a little counseling.  First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what?
<s> On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does.
<s> Augh?
<s> And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
<s> I look forward to reading your report.
<s> How did Doctor Almack react to that?
<s> You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.
<s> It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
<s> Ready quantum torpedo.
<s> Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
<s> I am the Borg.
<s> Understood. Keep me informed.
<s> How serious is the damage?
<s> There should be an access hatch nearby...
<s> This is Picard. I've suspended the launch sequence.
<s> Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
<s> We're crossing the threshold!
<s> It'll be tight, but we should make it.
<s> Ready.
<s> Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
<s> Something wrong with that?
<s> No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
<s> Steady as she goes.
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
<s> Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.
<s> We have to cover both possibilities.  We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in.
<s> They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
<s> I'll keep that in mind.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Where the hell are they going?
<s> Hold that thought.
<s> Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.
<s> I wish I knew. Uhura?
<s> Can you - ?
<s> Chancellor Gorkon, can you hear me? Chancellor...?
<s> What's the Brotherhood of Aliens?
<s> That cunning little Vulcan...
<s> Now there's a poser.
<s> You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
<s> I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.
<s> Uhura, monitor!
<s> Aye, sir; thrusters...
<s> Aye, sir; thrusters...
<s> Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
<s> Kill him! He's the one!!
<s> Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
<s> We didn't kill Gorkon.
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman -  ... so I volunteered.
<s> Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
<s> Right -
<s> You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
<s> Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
<s> Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
<s> They're dying.
<s> The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
<s> I'm going to sleep it off. Let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.
<s> I am uncertain.
<s> He was just about to explain the whole damn -
<s> What peace conference?
<s> Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "S." You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -
<s> Not for the actions of another. No one is responsible for any actions but his own. Human beings -
<s> Not yet... Section 4236...
<s> Confirmed, Captain!
<s> What?
<s> Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
<s> If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
<s> What exactly does that mean?
<s> Yes, please continue.
<s> No.
<s> Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
<s> Not tonight, I have work here.
<s> I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
<s> Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?
<s> He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
<s> The resemblance is... striking.
<s> Do you have a moment, sir?
<s> How could I not?
<s> I not only know him, Deanna, I am him.. and he is me!
<s> I know how he thinks.
<s> Make it so.
<s> Then how did a Reman get to be Praetor? I don't get it.
<s> What programs were accessed?
<s> Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.
<s> Sir, we won’t be able to bring you back. It’s a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
<s> There's more... as always. He's Reman.
<s> Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
<s> What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
<s> On screen.
<s> Who was it?
<s> Aye, sir
<s> A coup d'etat?
<s> It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
<s> Away team. Transporter room four.
<s> Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes. The eyes have it.
<s> I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
<s> Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
<s> And what of the Enterprise?
<s> He is what his life has made him!
<s> I am.
<s> Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!
<s> It is... invigorating.
<s> Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi, get those shields online.
<s> We're being hailed.
<s> They will obey, Praetor.
<s> I have a purpose.
<s> And mine is wearing thin, young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--
<s> How much are your rooms?
<s> It is beautiful.
<s> Thank you.
<s> About five miles back.
<s> Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?
<s> We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
<s> When can we expect containment?
<s> It's taken on a disguise.
<s> Oh shit!!!
<s> We don't know what else to do. We need results.
<s> I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
<s> What?
<s> I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
<s> Why are you doing this to me? I'll give you whatever...
<s> Which way do you want to go?
<s> What.
<s> Good.
<s> Coupons.
<s> From?
<s> My... husband.
<s> Shit?
<s> Candy.
<s> You want to try it?
<s> Shit!
<s> My...  ...car will take me...  ...up there... home.
<s> 'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
<s> Yes.
<s> Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
<s> Can I have the gun?
<s> No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
<s> Yes, they are.
<s> I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
<s> Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know.
<s> If you want to keep it, you can.
<s> You could have killed us both!!
<s> Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on.
<s> It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
<s> I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.
<s> Bullshit!
<s> It was only an accident that we discovered them.
<s> Judy, that's stupid.
<s> Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
<s> We will.  Something's wrong here. She's helping him now.
<s> If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
<s> Leave him alone, Tran.
<s> I just got to talk to you for one second.
<s> Come on, Faith!  He's just toying with you.  And when he gets bored, you'll be yesterday's papers.
<s> A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
<s> I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
<s> You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops have more to worry about in this city than the squid-trade, believe me--
<s> Least you can do.
<s> Shutup a second!
<s> I'm on her.
<s> Yeah.  No, not really.
<s> He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
<s> I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
<s> And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
<s> Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
<s> Who was just here?
<s> Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
<s> Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See?
<s> I do mean it.  And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  You understand?
<s> Strickland.
<s> You'll see.
<s> Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!
<s> Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
<s> So that gives you something.
<s> I need to see more... get more detail.  Something.  I feel his presence, so strong...
<s> It's not your fault.
<s> Now you're really getting paranoid.
<s> S'okay.  I know you still love me.
<s> Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  "A Love Supreme." Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.
<s> She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
<s> It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.
<s> People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
<s> Yeah, right, blow it open.
<s> You never told me.
<s> A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
<s> Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.
<s> Are you going to make me beg?
<s> Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
<s> To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
<s> Ten miles back on the Texas side.
<s> Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
<s> Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
<s> It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
<s> At the field office.
<s> Another what?
<s> I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
<s> He got away. I had him. He got away.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.
<s> Huh?, sir.
<s> I was visiting an old college friend.
<s> I didn't use Low's name.
<s> I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
<s> You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose.
<s> Listen to this guy? Can you believe this? He'll never change. Born a liar, first word out of his mouth was a lie. Make up a story, always a story, any goddamn story, to save his ass.
<s> Beats me. He just asked me to come along, double-check the forensics.  What did you do to piss him off?
<s> This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
<s> That information's being withheld from the media.
<s> The other reason?
<s> I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
<s> I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
<s> Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
<s> We did find these, however.
<s> I guess I'm a little paranoid.
<s> They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
<s> No weapon.
<s> I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.
<s> The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found.
<s> It was the mall.
<s> Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about the absence. I had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel.
<s> Something came up, Murman, my man.
<s> [Hello, Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials, I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]
<s> So you're the new meat?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> I know, I know.
<s> You're money, baby.
<s> What's that like?
<s> Nikki.
<s> Hi.
<s> Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
<s> Yes. Like the quiche.
<s> Why? You're not a real man?
<s> It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
<s> Uh, if the guy wants to.
<s> Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...
<s> My pleasure.
<s> No matter what... like splitting aces.
<s> Did you get it?
<s> ...And she's with someone else.
<s> I'm a comedian.
<s> Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
<s> Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
<s> Six years.
<s> Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
<s> Listen. I had a great time.
<s> That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.
<s> ...get the hell outta here already...
<s> Are you on the other line?
<s> ...Six months.
<s> Fine... I guess. You?
<s> Really?
<s> Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
<s> Right.
<s> Right... or more likely the opposite.
<s> There's the rub.
<s> Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
<s> I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
<s> Sure. Kick me when I'm down.
<s> Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
<s> ..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
<s> No. Just O.J.
<s> Don't sweat it. Now I got an L.A. gun story. You should hear the way I tell to the guys back home. He had an Uzi. Mike half-smiles.
<s> Well, you're doing so well...
<s> At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...
<s> They went for someone with more theme park experience. I woulda killed for that job.
<s> Make someone bleed.
<s> So, what? Eleven?
<s> ...He's derivative...
<s> You asshole.
<s> What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
<s> 213-555-4679. That's all. I just wanted to leave my number. I don't want you to think I'm weird, or desperate or something...  ...I mean, you know, we should just hang out. That's it. No expectations. Just, you know, hang out. Bye. 
<s> Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
<s> What are you talking about? Vegas?
<s> Just bring your card. Half an hour.
<s> What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
<s> ...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
<s> Yeah? Well obviously not always!
<s> I know she's coming back.
<s> That's what I'm telling you, baby. The babies love that stuff. They don't want all that sensitive shit. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. They know what you want. What do you think? You think they don't?
<s> Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.
<s> I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
<s> I didn't even like her, to be honest.
<s> I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
<s> What?!?
<s> It's on.
<s> A day.
<s> Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
<s> No.
<s> True.
<s> ...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
<s> Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
<s> ...it's definitely on.
<s> Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
<s> Be smart about it.
<s> Our little baby's growing up...
<s> I'll have the Blackbeard over easy.
<s> I ask for Justice.
<s> America has been good to me...
<s> Like hell I will.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's sick for good this winter.
<s> We gotta move...
<s> Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!
<s> Maybe, or you gotta know now.
<s> And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?
<s> Should I bring him in.
<s> They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
<s> You wanted me to be your son.
<s> Yes.
<s> Even so, I don't think it is safe here anymore.  I've made plans to move you to a villa near Siracuse. You must go right away.
<s> Yes.
<s> This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
<s> You look good, too.
<s> Mike!
<s> I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.
<s> If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
<s> Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
<s> Yeah Kay, I'm here.
<s> Goodbye.
<s> Let HER ask.
<s> You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
<s> How's Mom?
<s> Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
<s> I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
<s> I do renounce them.
<s> I do wish to be baptized.
<s> Is my credit good enough to buy you out?
<s> I don't get it.
<s> It's vile.
<s> Oh darling -- is that for me?
<s> Oh, it was.
<s> It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
<s> Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.
<s> I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling you what I --
<s> What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
<s> You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.
<s> No!
<s> Relax.
<s> Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
<s> I thought you'd missed the train.
<s> I'm not going to say anything -- to Marge, or anybody, the police -- It's a secret between us and I'll keep it.
<s> No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
<s> Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit?
<s> Marge and I are getting married.
<s> What are you doing?
<s> Dickie?
<s> No thanks.  Some kid at the American Express Office.  Are you living here?
<s> Have you done something to your hair?
<s> Is it on "delle Croce, just off the Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you? Last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions. That's not fair, you probably do know your ass from your elbow. I'll see you.
<s> I just don't believe that!
<s> Thanks, yes, I think we did.
<s> Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
<s> I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
<s> I hope she never knows.
<s> Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
<s> Tom, I love you!  See!  I bought it for him, for his birthday.
<s> So I'm learning.
<s> Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
<s> Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?
<s> Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
<s> Really? That's swell. No, I was just -- you're way ahead of me! Great!
<s> Hello Marge!
<s> What?
<s> No glasses.
<s> As in the...?
<s> Randall.
<s> I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
<s> Where have you been since then?
<s> They found this in Dickie's place in Rome.
<s> Just because he doesn't like Americans!
<s> Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
<s> Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...
<s> I give up.
<s> Well, that's entirely your fault. And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too.
<s> I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
<s> Peter, I... I...
<s> Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.
<s> No. Here is a pattern. Two days ago Freddie Miles is dead -- he leaves your apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a little boat is found in San Remo full of rocks, and the owner tells the Police it was stolen on November 7th. We look at hotel records and we see oh! Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then our boatman remembers two Americans taking a boat.
<s> Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
<s> I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
<s> Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
<s> Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
<s> Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab.  I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
<s> I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
<s> Well, I don't follow movies too much...
<s> Yeah.
<s> The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
<s> I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
<s> No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
<s> I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.
<s> Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there?
<s> Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
<s> Could you see anything?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
<s> Stick up?
<s> Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice, Travis.
<s> All right.  You see that guy over there?  His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here.
<s> I don't like my real name.
<s> Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
<s> I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from myself.
<s> I understand, mister. It means something, really.
<s> Besides, I've got to stay here.
<s> You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. You should get rid of them.
<s> I think you should go home, but otherwise I think you should go. It would be great for you. You have to get away from here. The city's a sewer, you gotta get out of it.
<s> My work may take me out of New York.
<s> I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much.
<s> Listen, son, you gonna get smart, you can leave right now.
<s> Why do you ask?
<s> Oh?
<s> I'm no cop.  I want some action.
<s> Yeah, Iris. You know anybody by that name?
<s> Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
<s> Yeah?
<s> The taxi life, you mean.
<s> Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
<s> You want to talk about it?
<s> MY girlfriend's pregnant.
<s> Don't let him do that.
<s> During the time I cooperate, will I be outside?  Outside a jail?
<s> You suppose?
<s> Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing?  HE'S ON THE= PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit.  Gotta go.
<s> For cottonmouth. Goodspeed and the S.E.A.L.s exchange looks.
<s> The cell, Mason.
<s> Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector.  You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers...
<s> Well...
<s> Go on home, folks.  And thanks for the welcome.
<s> Why me?
<s> Nothing.  
<s> Oh.
<s> Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.
<s> Guess I must've learned.
<s> Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
<s> Yes sir.  But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there.
<s> Good.  Good.  Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935.  A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?
<s> Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
<s> No, sir.
<s> I'm not refuting anything.
<s> That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
<s> Um... no.  I don't have a statement at this time.
<s> I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail.
<s> Ben, when's Delly due back?
<s> Well, son, you're home!
<s> Give the man a hug, boy!  That's your father!
<s> The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I remember that one.  Saw it over at the Bijou.  So, you remember that, huh?
<s> Good to meet you.  Again.
<s> Thanks.
<s> We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
<s> A super market.  Huh.
<s> Can't wait.
<s> Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
<s> Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess.  Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to.
<s> Oh.  What... what time is it?
<s> No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
<s> ... Ernie.
<s> Dad, I...
<s> The film broke...
<s> I guess I did.
<s> Hey, it's the best way to tell.
<s> Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
<s> "Ashes To Ashes?"
<s> So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.
<s> It's wrong, Leo.
<s> Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
<s> You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
<s> 'Course they all know me.  And I know all them.  Town's got my name, don't it?
<s> The war...
<s> I already have.
<s> My girlfriend.  If she still is...
<s> It's a lovely garden.
<s> Lovebirds.
<s> How'd you happen to come here?
<s> I suspected as much.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
<s> That's up to you.
<s> Then go.
<s> It's what you said, Mom. Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.
<s> I know.
<s> I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
<s> Morning.
<s> Try my best.
<s> Yep.
<s> Yes?
<s> That's where the Brenners live.
<s> Mmmm.
<s> The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded...
<s> I don't know what good that'll do.  Chickens won't eat.
<s> Yes, very.
<s> You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
<s> I'm sorry, Mitch.
<s> Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
<s> No, not exactly.
<s> Do I sound foolish to you?
<s> I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
<s> What are we going to do about it, Al?
<s> All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney.
<s> Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there. 
<s> Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know that for a fact.
<s> Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
<s> About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
<s> Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
<s> Those are canaries, Miss.  Doesn't this make you feel awful?
<s> All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
<s> That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
<s> Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
<s> I am.  Good day.  Madam. 
<s> That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
<s> I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
<s> I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
<s> It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you...
<s> None of your business.  Am I still bleeding?
<s> Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
<s> Famished.
<s> His wife changed the channel.
<s> It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
<s> Yes.
<s> I told you what happened in Rome!
<s> It is for me.
<s> Helping travelers.
<s> I'm glad you do.
<s> What?
<s> Yes.
<s> No, I have my things in the car.
<s> I'll get it.
<s> Growing a beard...
<s> Well, they'll go along with anything.
<s> Hear, hear!
<s> The bay doesn't.
<s> We'll take it slow until we get to the main road.  Are you ready?
<s> Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
<s> Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
<s> What? Oh, yes, certainly.
<s> No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
<s> That would be just fine.  Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me.  No, this is a small one.  Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you?  Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six.  Yes, a California plate.  No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office?  Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie. 
<s> What were the crows after at the school?
<s> Then let's go. Now!
<s> Put on your coats! Do you want to get trapped here?
<s> I want you to help my little girl.
<s> I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
<s> Richardson is a fine student.  He's got a glib tongue, but you'll be a better doctor, Fettes.  Come along now --
<s> So she told me.  I'm a teacher -- not a practitioner.
<s> No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
<s> Your son, ma'am?  He must have been a fine boy for the wee dog to love him so.
<s> Medicine?  That'll keep.  Sit down.
<s> Don't call me that confounded name, I tell you.
<s> I am a doctor. I teach medicine.
<s> Here, have another glass, MacFarlane. I'll take you home and we'll be friends again -- now that you know that you're Knox's man and my friend -- aye, forever.
<s> I take no gifts from you.
<s> We have never been friends.
<s> I have other means of sustenance.
<s> Would you bribe me to leave you be?
<s> Yes, Doctor.
<s> I'm looking for my friends.
<s> Keep that thing away from me.
<s> A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
<s> They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
<s> What Scar? What fucking scar?
<s> I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
<s> How can you die if you're already dead?
<s> Your father gave them to both of you.
<s> Yes I do, I really do.
<s> I don't want to see!
<s> No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
<s> Yeah, we do.
<s> You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?
<s> You mean Alex.
<s> She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!
<s> She's... sick.  Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
<s> Looks like you have them both on.
<s> It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see.  I thought you'd have the solution by this time.
<s> No -- not at all.
<s> My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
<s> I assure you such power exists.
<s> That can easily be arranged.
<s> Professor Barnhardt.
<s> Of course, dear.
<s> Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.
<s> No. It's for a lot of other things, too.
<s> Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
<s> All right.
<s> Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
<s> He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight.
<s> He says their medicine is that much more advanced.  He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
<s> Just Klaatu.
<s> The first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle.
<s> It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.
<s> I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.
<s> Come on in.
<s> Is that what you're thinking about?
<s> Yes--?
<s> I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
<s> Yes -- Just exactly.
<s> Who?
<s> That's right.
<s> You don't.
<s> C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
<s> Why?  They're only noodles.
<s> Hey, take it easy.
<s> No.  Stick around.
<s> I will, David!
<s> A big legal war wasn't going to improve anybody's situation.  We've all been through enough.  Besides I was raised better than that. Thanks for having us, Dad.
<s> Closet monster!?
<s> It's called the Indian walk. Walkin' without makin' a sound.
<s> 'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
<s> You have a T.V.?
<s> I like Michael.
<s> For what.
<s> No.  I'm up.
<s> Okay.
<s> Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
<s> Can't.  Got plans of my own.
<s> I thought we were poor.
<s> No, no... there's plenty for everybody... Oh, Max, this is Sam... and the Frog Brothers...
<s> Must be a circuit breaker.
<s> Do I look that needy?
<s> It's you I was after all along, Lucy.  To be our day time guardian. I knew if we could bring Sam and Michael into the faimly, there'd be no way you could say no.
<s> Burn??  Are you kidding?  It's freezing!
<s> Michael invited me in.  Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless.
<s> Star.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Michael's great.  I like Michael.
<s> Save Laddie first.
<s> Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
<s> He was protecting <u>you</u>!
<s> What about Mom?
<s> And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?!  You can't predict this time of year...
<s> Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
<s> No.  Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.  Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...
<s> Anybody sick?
<s> Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
<s> Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
<s> Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
<s> Watch Clark.
<s> Who you trying to protect, mutherfucker?  I'm telling you this S.O.B. could be one of them.
<s> Childs, you got the torch?  You get your ass in here!!
<s> I just can't believe this voodoo bullshit.  You believe this voodoo bullshit, Blair?
<s> ... Where is everybody?!  I'm half frostbit!
<s> Smart S.O.B.  He put it together piece by piece.
<s> Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
<s> If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
<s> All in Norwegian.
<s> How far's that?
<s> Started with six.  There'd be four others left.
<s> Well, stick to it.
<s> Well, stick with it.  I want you at it round the clock.  We got to get help in here...
<s> No.
<s> Could anyone have gotten it from you?
<s> Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
<s> Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
<s> Why?
<s> Forget about Childs.  He's over.
<s> Calm down and get in your position.
<s> So what do you make of it?
<s> Right.  Half of us awake at all times.
<s> I had an accident.
<s> On the towers?
<s> Where?
<s> Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
<s> Why should I help you?  You primates -- you great, lumbering, hairy animals, drenched in blood from the moment of your hideous conception -- what have you ever used knowledge for but destruction and bloodshed!  A little bit of learning and you lay waste to the world!  You're no better than the Morlocks!
<s> Oh, shut up.
<s> This is the way in?
<s> As slaves.
<s> I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
<s> What's happening to the moon?!
<s> No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!
<s> Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
<s> Holding you... again.
<s> Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
<s> What?
<s> I live with it every minute of every day.
<s> That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> All right, all right -- here -- everything --
<s> Your husband is dead?
<s> I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
<s> Why not?
<s> Yes.  Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...
<s> Just a dream.  You should sleep too.  You're still not well.
<s> What you need is an engineer.  If you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights, some basic block and tackle mechanism, you could to this a lot more easily.
<s> I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
<s> You know this?
<s> Ouch -- all right, wish me luck.
<s> The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation, a careful evolutionary process, not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
<s> Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
<s> No...
<s> I took a different route.
<s> New Yorkers.
<s> We don't know.
<s> I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
<s> Depends on what you're seeing.
<s> No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
<s> I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
<s> How?
<s> No, we were patients.
<s> Mom, he just fixed our car.
<s> You two ok?
<s> Yeah.
<s> I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
<s> You think Lorenson kills you?
<s> I don't know.
<s> You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
<s> It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
<s> I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
<s> William, you're not making sense.
<s> No, he didn't.
<s> Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we?
<s> When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?
<s> Good. How's your mom?
<s> You're not crazy.
<s> Believe me, I know.
<s> [Beat] Yeah, it is.
<s> Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?
<s> You still don't believe me, do you?
<s> Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
<s> [Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.
<s> [Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
<s> [Beat] I was dropped off.
<s> No, I'm ok.
<s> You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean, you're normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and I have a couch.
<s> [Beat] Why?
<s> You remember it?
<s> Well then, it's a good thing you're not regional manager and I am.
<s> Yes, baby?
<s> Good.  You wanna tell me what happened?
<s> Well, you'd best get something. Even if they didn't do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it.  I want somebody to at least talk to 'em.  Put out an APB with a description and see what we get back.
<s> Oh, great.
<s> It's okay.  I'm married, too.
<s> It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most of the time I just let it slide.
<s> Well, you wanna use the shower?
<s> I'm a robber.
<s> What the fuck is going on?
<s> Christ, sure... yes!
<s> Can't it go to any office?
<s> It's a place called Shaw's Siesta Motel.  The address is 1921 North East 23.  It's under your name.
<s> Peaches.
<s> Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
<s> Who is it?
<s> Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
<s> Yes.
<s> You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.
<s> In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
<s> I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
<s> Yes.
<s> Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
<s> I suggested we go to the police, but you didn't like that; so, frankly, Louise, I'm all out of ideas.
<s> I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
<s> Thelma, I'm going to Mexico.  I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass.  Are you up to this?  I mean, I have to know.  This isn't a game.  I'm in deep shit.  I gotta know what you're gonna do.
<s> I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.  We're too conspicuous.
<s> He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away.
<s> Nothing.  It got messed up.
<s> Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
<s> Just past Boise City.
<s> I swear, before yesterday, neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this.  But if you ever met my husband, you'd know why I just can... You wanna step out of the car, please?  You wanna put your hands on your head, please?  Louise, shoot the radio.
<s> Yes.
<s> Are you alright?
<s> Yeah, right.  We're not gonna get caught.
<s> I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
<s> No... You've always been crazy. This is just the first chance you've had to really express yourself.
<s> It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!
<s> All this for us?
<s> What are you talkin' about?
<s> Grrrreat!
<s> Fresno.
<s> No, I just meant...
<s> You sent that?
<s> I'm sorry, it's just that you're taking this all wrong, pal. Don't you see? You're liberated. I feel liberated. I mean here you've been in therapy thinking you blew it with the greatest girl ever, and it turns out that getting your dick stuck in your zipper was the best thing that ever happened to you!
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Yeah feels like it.
<s> Oh come on, why would I lie?
<s> 'That right?
<s> Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna pack my bags and go back to my own place.
<s> Fucking Sully! Look at you!
<s> I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.
<s> Healy, what I just tell you?
<s> Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
<s> It's right there on your golf bag.
<s> Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.
<s> Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
<s> -- He's in a cage?!
<s> Wow, I've never seen him like this. He doesn't usually like guys.
<s> We will, but first I have a surprise.
<s> When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism.
<s> Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
<s> Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
<s> -- Love story of our time.
<s> Hey, watch your mouth -- she's a great gal. I'm the dumbshit for lying to her.
<s> You look great.  Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants?
<s> Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're not going to believe this -- well, you'll believe it, there's no reason not to -- but I just got beeped for emergency surgery. Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to bail on you.
<s> No.
<s> You can't be serious.
<s> You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses.
<s> No, not at all.
<s> I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half. Not bad.
<s> Oh my.
<s> She's in a wheelchair?!
<s> It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
<s> Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
<s> Surprised?
<s> I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Harvard?
<s> How'd you manage that one?
<s> Nice.
<s> Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line!
<s> No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
<s> Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
<s> Hm?
<s> The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
<s> Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
<s> Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
<s> You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
<s> Healy.
<s> Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
<s> No no no, Tucker, thank you.
<s> I appreciate you looking out for me.
<s> Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
<s> Just a minute.
<s> Who's that?
<s> Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
<s> Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
<s> Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.
<s> That's more like it.  Two more nitrate-sicles please.
<s> Ah, my roots here are too deep. I love my practice, the people I work with, Warren's got a nice thing going  Why don't you just move down here and marry me?
<s> Trying to be.
<s> What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
<s> All right, let's go.
<s> Then what the fuck did you do it for?
<s> I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
<s> What?! No please, sir --
<s> Oh.  Oh, that's a good one.
<s> Of course. Our pledge can be relayed to any government official Secretary Khruschev sees fit to satisfy.
<s> We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
<s> -- Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I told you how stupid it was to float the Lippman article! But you wouldn't listen to me. What if there hasn't been a coup at all? What if it's you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade?
<s> Smoke.
<s> Kenny. It's over.
<s> Says what, Kenny?
<s> Understood, sir. We need to step up the overflights, finalize our pilots' target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes.
<s> Kids are supposed to get detention.
<s> Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
<s> Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
<s> I don't know. I don't know.
<s> Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.
<s> And we can't purge the Chiefs. Our invasion talk will look like a bluff. Or even that there's been an attempted coup.
<s> Okay, Ken. We're going.
<s> Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --
<s> And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
<s> I'm afraid not, Mr. President. The sub has positioned itself between the Pierce and the Soviet ships. Admiral Anderson insists it's too much of a risk to proceed with stopping the freighters. The Pierce would be a sitting duck for the sub.
<s> Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
<s> Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
<s> They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let them go. We're tightening the net on him. We know he's on the reservation.
<s> The only good Indian is a dead Indian, does that old adage still hold true out here?
<s> -- don't "man" me, Jimmy. Where's the key?
<s> That's what it looks like, doesn't it? But that's what a ten gauge, choke-bored, shotgun will look like when it hits your lower back from five feet away.
<s> Cooch. You're my hero.
<s> Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
<s> A long way from home. You be careful out there.
<s> Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never been behind the wheel of a car. It's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving. His parents were killed in a car wreck.
<s> I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
<s> Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
<s> The Little Walking River. You're right. This is part of it. So whoever sunk this car didn't compensate for drought. Goddamn.
<s> You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
<s> Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.
<s> Medicine. As in medicine man?
<s> Why should I tell you.
<s> I don't see the connection.
<s> Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.
<s> Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.
<s> Ray --
<s> What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths.
<s> No. I was sent here cuz I'm Indian. And a good cop.
<s> Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
<s> No. So we can do what the old man said. Red Deer Table, Walter. We have to go.
<s> We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
<s> You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
<s> Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All over again.
<s> Yellow Bird committed suicide at three o'clock this morning. Some gung-ho agent from D.C. pushed him into a corner. You're playing a losing game. Pull over.
<s> What's with you people? Why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time? I came through, man.
<s> I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
<s> They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth.
<s> What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn.
<s> Well, it is. It is that, too.
<s> That's all!
<s> It's classified.
<s> You let me make a fool of myself.
<s> Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
<s> About as much as they think about killing me.
<s> Winston Churchill.
<s> Thanks very much.  Care for some suchi?.
<s> I was flying...my responsibility.
<s> That's what I want.
<s> It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
<s> That's up to you.
<s> ...Something like that.
<s> Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer.
<s> Remember one thing.
<s> What is he doing?
<s> These guys are getting on my nerves.
<s> Okay, okay.
<s> I GOT ONE COMING UP.
<s> Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, I've got it.
<s> What are you talking about, we gotta go!
<s> 280, 290, 300 knots.
<s> The plane is fine.
<s> Well what?
<s> What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it?
<s> So's my Johnson.
<s> What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
<s> Don't chew it, you won't have it that long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.
<s> I want him!
<s> No shit! That why they call him Ice?
<s> Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky.
<s> STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
<s> Figured out what?
<s> So have I.
<s> Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.
<s> What the hell you doing?
<s> Bad?
<s> I talked a man back once. Three months later, we lost him. It's his decision. Only he knows.
<s> Sir?
<s> Yes sir.
<s> I know.
<s> I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man.
<s> He ain't got five kids to feed.
<s> Hey, I got four kids to feed.
<s> Thank you.
<s> May I use your pen?
<s> Fuck you.
<s> He's lying.  Hauser turned against you.
<s> Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
<s> Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> It's about goddamn time.
<s> Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
<s> Come on...put his head in place.
<s> Not really.  I've just always been fascinated by Mars.
<s> Hetero.
<s> Brunette.
<s> At Rekall.
<s> No need to be rude.  I'll do it.
<s> It's a symbol.  Of your desire to return to reality. --Inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.
<s> Any news of Quaid?
<s> Arrest that woman!
<s> O.K., everybody pull out!
<s> Relax, you'll live longer.
<s> You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?
<s> Yes, you do.  That's why we brought you here.  --  Cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain.  And Kuato's  gonna dig it out.
<s> Don't fuck with your brain, pal.  It ain't worth it.
<s> Yeah, sweetheart?
<s> I'm late.
<s> Some men just tried to kill me!
<s> Take it easy.  Tell me exactly what happened?  Why would "spies" want to kill you?
<s> Beats me.  I just work here.
<s> I'm honored.
<s> How real does it seem?
<s> Whatever you say...Just answer one question.  What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?
<s> I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet.  Now you tell me.  Is that worth three hundred measly credits?
<s> There's something I have to tell you...
<s> If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.
<s> Jump!
<s> The reactor.
<s> I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.
<s> No good.  You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail.
<s> Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
<s> I thought you called it your pecker.  Look, don't make the mistake I made.  Twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like Miss October 1968, and where'd it get me?  Here with you.
<s> Fifteen lousy bucks.
<s> Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
<s> Great.  Thank you.
<s> Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
<s> So this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime?
<s> Little sons of bitches.
<s> Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
<s> So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
<s> Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>People</u> magazine...
<s> Civil?  I'm civil.
<s> She wants to lay down.  I'm a little worried.
<s> Yeah, Burt.  The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III.
<s> You don't get it, Pham.  The idea was: we were ripping you off.
<s> Okay, ten dollars.
<s> Those scumsuckers are my radials, Pham!
<s> You okay?
<s> Wait!  How are you going to know they're all following it?
<s> Please... I need to sleep...
<s> Absolutely.
<s> -- With objection!
<s> Complain to the Bar Commission.
<s> I suppose I could find an inmate who'd say that Shu boasted about Chinatown just to survive in the joint -- though he didn't really do it...
<s> What about entrapment?
<s> I can describe it.
<s> No. No...
<s> Right. You're right.
<s> I'm not a kid anymore, I can't be all over the map --
<s> -- Remember?
<s> Easy? No... We have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.
<s> What, the lunatic who --
<s> "Have to"? No...
<s> Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
<s> I've got a meeting in Chinatown.
<s> What's Art Esparza?
<s> You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
<s> Least we'd already be at the Morgue.
<s> I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
<s> Eddie, these things take time. Particularly at this hour...
<s> Want to tell me what went down here?
<s> "Painted"?
<s> I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
<s> For awhile we had this dream we were innocent. That was our bond... but then we woke up. And now I'd like to hear everything.
<s> See-cil.
<s> They g-got the wrong g-guy.
<s> But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court.
<s> I'd need a continuance. Three weeks at least.
<s> Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
<s> Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
<s> -- Roger --
<s> ...A soldado, he takes care of it.
<s> Shu's the only one I know of...
<s> A woman.
<s> Blonde.
<s> She is preparing a great abundance of food.
<s> I want you to kill for me.
<s> Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
<s> Bobby...
<s> We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.
<s> Did she have someone with her?
<s> OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
<s> COOP, AGENT CHET DESMOND HAS DISAPPEARED. GONE LIKE THE WIND IN DEER MEADOW.
<s> What?
<s> Anything else?
<s> What happened to her?
<s> Oh.
<s> I'll get my kit.
<s> Thanks, Sam, for the good work. You have a good eye for detail.
<s> He probably wanted to drive over.
<s> Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
<s> Sure. What do you want me to call you?
<s> No, I want to smoke.
<s> No, you should forget about last night.
<s> What can I tell you?
<s> And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
<s> Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
<s> Let's go all the way.
<s> Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
<s> Gobble, gobble, gobble.
<s> Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
<s> I can't tonight.
<s> That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
<s> What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
<s> Fish eyes?
<s> I understand.
<s> Sure honey, what's the hurry?
<s> I'm sorry, Mom.
<s> Oh, Leland.
<s> Nothing, I chickened out.
<s> As if I didn't know.
<s> What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
<s> Neither does he. That's where he loses. This man's scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his bluff.
<s> All right. But let's keep the price down. I've called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
<s> It looks that way.
<s> I... yes.
<s> I...
<s> Frank Galvin. We've met before.
<s> Don't equivocate. Be positive. Just tell the truth.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> When she...
<s> Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
<s> That's perfectly all right. I'm kind of rushed. Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
<s> Right. Who called?
<s> ...and you're going to do that?
<s> You're going to settle out of court?
<s> I understand.
<s> ...that's perfectly all right.
<s> This is a complicated case, your Honor...
<s> Ready, your Honor.
<s> The TV didn't work.
<s> And what are you? A cop?
<s> What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
<s> Maybe what?
<s> What is that to you...?
<s> No.
<s> I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number?
<s> My subscription lapsed three years ago...
<s> ...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
<s> I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
<s> You know, you're pushy, fella...
<s> ...I know. I went...
<s> He's... you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.  He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
<s> That's for sure, Frank.
<s> I'm going to help her.
<s> I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?
<s> Admittance form is wrong.
<s> Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
<s> Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
<s> D'you find the obstetric nurse?
<s> I think we tried that. The case is over.
<s> Yeah. I'm awake.
<s> The Doctors.
<s> ...one of the other nurses?
<s> All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.?
<s> Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
<s> ...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
<s> But I think I know where she'll be....
<s> Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
<s> Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!
<s> I feel like I did one time when I was small.  Awful scared and lonesome...I'd wandered off - I've forgotten why - but the family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me.  They found me in a church.  I was afraid to go in any place else.
<s> I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
<s> They could be as curious about us as we are about them.
<s> Yes, with these suits.  We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?
<s> I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
<s> I wonder if they're going through this too...?
<s> It's pointing out to the gully - where that meteor came down.
<s> If we get what transportation we can, and pick up instruments and books from Pacific-Tech...
<s> It's always been a good persuader.
<s> They'll probably move at dawn.
<s> Everything human don't have to look like you and me....
<s> Sure, sure!  Everybody understands you wave the white flag, you wanna be friends.
<s> He's not showing it until it's down.  But it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  You and Robert got great ratings today. Which is the first thing we needed to know.
<s> Come on.  Kids love horror.
<s> Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
<s> I'll be there in three hours.
<s> Get her back!  I've got to go in!  Get me a full anesthetic, STAT!
<s> Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
<s> He sleepwalks, you idiot!  He's fully capable of walking out of this hospital.  Oh my God...He thinks I've gone home...
<s> The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
<s> Steady...
<s> John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
<s> Yeah, sure.
<s> Yes?
<s> No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
<s> Big truck went right by before you opened the door.  Life on the Fault Line.
<s> By storytellers, of all things.  Every so often, they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence.  Then it's held prisoner for a while.  In the story.
<s> Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
<s> But it was you that gave Nancy her strength.  So to get out he has to come through you.  And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
<s> Choice?  What kind of choice?
<s> Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
<s> You miss him.
<s> He knows.
<s> Give me some time to blow the man down...
<s> Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.
<s> Watch the tell-tales Chuck.  If we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Gieg, Chuck.
<s> That's what they get for not locking the door.
<s> I just can't believe it.
<s> What?
<s> I know enough.
<s> Well, and it's pretty cool too, ya know?  Bein' here together an all...
<s> Me too.
<s> Fine.
<s> I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
<s> You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.
<s> The fact is... We'd like you to give Phil another chance.
<s> He killed the dolphin.
<s> Of what?
<s> Let the blow drive the boat down wind.  Neutralize our canvas.
<s> Happily, it all worked out... This time.  Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk.
<s> Why are you here?
<s> It has nothing to do with him.
<s> It's okay.  I'll be in, in a minute.  Look, what do you want?
<s> We're short one long boat too.  Come on.
<s> Like you'd know what to do with one.
<s> Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
<s> No, Phil.  It's a mammal.
<s> Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
<s> Aaauuuhhh!!!
<s> I hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
<s> The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.  She never lost a race while you were Skipper.
<s> I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
<s> Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
<s> How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.
<s> Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
<s> This be it?
<s> Well... Yeah - okay.
<s> You black?
<s> You an indian?
<s> Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.
<s> She really say she was pregnant?
<s> She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
<s> You say it's straight ahead a mile?
<s> No... She's fine. Back home.
<s> Do you know Honduras, Johnny?
<s> Guilty on a reduced charge. Hundred dollar fine and ordered to desist. Pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place. You seen it. Plain filth.
<s> If you are truly wild at heart, you'll fight for your dreams... Don't turn away from love, Sailor... Don't turn away from love... Don't turn away from love.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> He is my sponsor. The General is the head of the secret police of Honduras.
<s> Hasta siempre.
<s> Sailor ain't a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And far's I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' Lula. Even there he was protectin' her. You oughta be thankin' him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em. Why am I tellin' you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful is all... You remember that night...
<s> No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
<s> Somethin' was upsettin' you bad last night, and you wanted to tell me and I figured you wanted to tell me so's I could help...
<s> See ya downstairs.
<s> You ain't actin', mama.
<s> Pace, your daddy'd love you even if you didn't have no hair at all.
<s> You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies. He had a long nose, too, like theirs. Did I ever tell you how he died?
<s> And you never told nobody about it?
<s> Here she goes again...
<s> That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...
<s> I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
<s> At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
<s> Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
<s> Those toenails dry yet? We got some dancin' to do.
<s> Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.
<s> You're excitin' me, honey. What'd she do?
<s> You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
<s> You certain?
<s> Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
<s> You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin' before I met you.
<s> Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
<s> I quit workin' for 'im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I don't know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames.
<s> What's that?
<s> I'm afraid she is, baby.
<s> Let's get outta here, honey.
<s> The only one.
<s> You sick?
<s> I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
<s> Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.
<s> That smell's still fillin' this room good.
<s> You talk to 'im some?...
<s> Lula, he mighta did, I don't know. But it don't matter now. Lotta guys go outta control in a war and it ain't their fault.
<s> Thanks, darlin', I know you got my best interest in mind, and I 'preciate it sincerely. I love you, but I gotta sleep now.
<s> I'll bet.
<s> Damn!
<s> HELL NO!!! That's the last thing we need... A buncha cops runnin' around.
<s> I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
<s> Lula's gone off with Sailor.
<s> What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.
<s> Yes... Get rid of him.
<s> Shoot him.
<s> Someone's gonna see us.
<s> Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.
<s> ...Yes you heard me... Don't ever call back here again.
<s> Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
<s> I didn't see nothin'...
<s> So I hear.
<s> Your wife.
<s> I thought you were tinkering.
<s> Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.
<s> Shut up and drink.
<s> Tripp.
<s> Hit your brakes.
<s> Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
<s> Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
<s> Maybe... I don't know.
<s> Only in your bones?
<s> What's to tell?
<s> Find the jacket.
<s> My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
<s> No wonder he screwed us over.
<s> Call it a hunch.
<s> Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last semester, what I said that time in office hours -- I hope there's no hard feelings.
<s> I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
<s> How long have you been having them?
<s> That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
<s> Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
<s> Shut up.  Cupcake. Please. Inside.
<s> Shoot.
<s> It's very convincing.
<s> No! What gave you that idea?
<s> I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in bed I figure them out. The stories.
<s> A little.
<s> She is. Ah. Here we go...
<s> You're welcome.
<s> What'd he say?
<s> Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
<s> Where's that?
<s> I never heard of it.
<s> Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
<s> Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school?
<s> Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
<s> Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box.
<s> I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy?
<s> Jealous? Of me?
<s> I never said that.
<s> Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay? The entire class combined -- including the lovely Hannah Green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?
<s> Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
<s> Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
<s> Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was...
<s> No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
<s> I told you, Sewickly Heights.
<s> It beats 'What's your major?'
<s> You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
<s> No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
<s> Really, Sara, I...
<s> James Leer.
<s> Terry was telling me about you on the plane. It was all so interesting.
<s> Why yes. How did you know?
<s> Tony. Now that I'm home.
<s> That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
<s> It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.
<s> I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
<s> Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office Monday morning.
<s> Taking the long way home.
<s> Hey, Professor Tripp.
<s> Neurologist? Why? What's wrong?
<s> I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
<s> Yeah, you still with Northland?
<s> Beautiful. How's business?
<s> Something wrong with that?
<s> Is it because of Anna?
<s> You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
<s> She's got all this new furniture now. She said it didn't fit anymore, so I kept it in the attic. I thought you might like it.
<s> No thanks.
<s> Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe inside I'm bad, and I'll always be bad.
<s> Carlos, I never raped a woman.
<s> Sure.
<s> I mean... feelings.
<s> In that birch tree is a nest.
<s> Is that right?
<s> Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.
<s> Got something to hide?
<s> You can't talk to me like --
<s> You going to take me on a nature walk?
<s> Yes.
<s> I count my blessings.
<s> 'Fraid not.
<s> Yeah.
<s> If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her.
<s> No you're not.
<s> I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
<s> A diary?
<s> What is your idea of being normal?
<s> Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal!
<s> I know --
<s> I know you're frustrated, Walter, but --
<s> I'm relaxed.
<s> I see my sister.
<s> In my bedroom, sleeping.
<s> In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
<s> We're little kids.
<s> Yes, a nap. Kids do that. You ever take a nap, Rosen?
<s> Nothing.
<s> This is garbage!
<s> Time.
<s> I feel... okay.
<s> I'm just quiet.
<s> Neither do you.
<s> I get that impression.
<s> When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.
<s> Because I like you.
<s> The worst?
<s> Don't be sorry for me. I did those things. No one else did. I'm dealing with that.
<s> Live together.
<s> Piece of cake, baby.
<s> Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole.  Hey, Perry!
<s> Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.
<s> Hey, you okay?
<s> Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me.
<s> Not for long.
<s> Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
<s> What do you think he saw?
<s> How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
<s> Lindsey!  Wait a second--
<s> Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off from chain of command.  He's exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced psychosis.  And he's got a nuclear weapon.  So, as a personal favor to me... will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?
<s> Yeah.  So sue me.
<s> We've only got one suit.
<s> NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
<s> 'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
<s> Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.
<s> It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!
<s> Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.
<s> You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
<s> I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...
<s> I'm thirsty.
<s> Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.
<s> You already know what they are.
<s> Sir, if you have no objections, may we start the search?
<s> That must be Basiluzzo.
<s> That's Patrizia's way of letting us know she's with us.
<s> Then why don't we go up and see the ruins?
<s> How should I be ... arrogant?
<s> And that's what I say, too. We could have all been killed.
<s> And why haven't they left each other?
<s> I know. I keep asking myself what I could have done to prevent all this from happening.
<s> I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For whom? If Anna were here I might understand your scruples. But she's not...
<s> And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
<s> Why?
<s> Aren't you going to change?
<s> Good night. Tell me that you love me.
<s> I deserve it.
<s> Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
<s> You say that just to flatter me.
<s> But what's gotten into you?... We would have known. Sandro must be out in the garden somewhere, taking a breath of fresh air, or watching the break of dawn. It would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type.
<s> But for what reason should I come there?
<s> But why?... What if it starts to rain?
<s> Really! So that you can stuff it with your geraniums.
<s> There too...
<s> Then let's get started... It's senseless to waste any more time.
<s> Listen, Marshal... As for there being reasons for going away, anyone of us might have three thousand of them. So you can assume that she had them. What I want to know, is it possible that the smugglers might have taken her aboard?
<s> Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
<s> I thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. Didn't you, Claudia?
<s> So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
<s> Because this is a Chinese radio.
<s> But for you, what comes first: music or love?
<s> Don't mention it... Pleased to be of service any time.
<s> Yes, even I had a mother. She was part Austrian, but she was still my mother. My childhood was like a tennis match; they bounced me back and forth, here and there...
<s> Lady Patrizia!
<s> I detest it. But, after all, what can you do... It's the latest...and I try my best to adapt myself.
<s> Is that far from here?
<s> Then let's call it a business proposition. Something to round out your salary.
<s> He loves you the way you are.
<s> Who?
<s> Yes, of God.
<s> Yes Mother.
<s> It made them holy.
<s> They were stained.
<s> Yes, Mother.
<s> No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
<s> At least once a week.
<s> Why should they?
<s> Do you remember the night they said it came?
<s> And what happened?
<s> The baby they made up.
<s> Where'd it come from before that?
<s> Yes I do,  but I want you to...
<s> Agnes...
<s> Would you like to ask them?
<s> Martha Louise Livingston.
<s> Not at the moment, no.
<s> Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
<s> I don't know.
<s> She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
<s> Oh, it's even more wonderful then.
<s> Where did you go?
<s> She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
<s> Somebody told her.
<s> Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.
<s> From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
<s> If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... 
<s> Yes.
<s> ... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Because I'm in trouble.
<s> Of what?
<s> May I open my eyes now?
<s> No.
<s> I'm afraid.
<s> Sister Marguerite I think.
<s> What do you feel?
<s> No... don't hit me please...
<s> What did she mean?
<s> And the passage to the barn?
<s> Agnes who did you see?
<s> Who?
<s> Yes.
<s> Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
<s> Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants this to come to trial, not the Church, not the Crown... least of all me.
<s> And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
<s> Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.
<s> You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
<s> When?
<s> Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
<s> Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
<s> ... Thank you.
<s> Unfiltered.
<s> She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.
<s> We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
<s> None as far as I know.
<s> Obviously there was.
<s> Look, someone gave her the baby.
<s> How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
<s> And in your eyes?
<s> When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
<s> And what happened?
<s> About two years before.
<s> But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
<s> And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God...  ... and aren't any worse off than you Mother. People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant...
<s> ???   ... virginity, right Mother?  Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
<s> I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
<s> Because I didn't know... 
<s> I'd like yours too.
<s> Bullshit!
<s> I'd love one.
<s> Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
<s> Would it stop you if I did?
<s> Of course.
<s> You think she's a saint?
<s> She is an innocent.
<s> I left it with her and I went for help.
<s> All right, take your hoop and bowl.
<s> How about Ding Dong?
<s> They'll be here.
<s> Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
<s> You do - repeatedly.
<s> I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty.
<s> But I won't.
<s> I don't care.
<s> He hasn't.
<s> Is he?
<s> Oh, sorry I spoke.
<s> Something like that.
<s> Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
<s> I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
<s> You can learn from books.
<s> Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
<s> Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
<s> Me!
<s> Lip reading.
<s> Nothing good.
<s> Is there a fire, then?
<s> Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
<s> Every morning.
<s> That's all right then.
<s> Eh, don't take out me lines.
<s> That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?
<s> It's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
<s> Well, you shouldn't have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.
<s> Hi, our lot!
<s> I'm not, no.
<s> No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
<s> Oh, leave off!!!
<s> Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.
<s> Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
<s> But...
<s> Who?
<s> Get knotted!
<s> Nine hundred meters and dropping. 800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen.
<s> Point eight six.  We can walk on it.
<s> Activated.  Vertical drop checked. Correcting course.  On tangential course now, orbiting.  Crossing the terminator.  Entering night side.
<s> Is it solid?
<s> Looks like a derelict.
<s> No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
<s> Take care.
<s> Yeah, but this is hard work.  Can't talk now.
<s> God I'm hungry.
<s> The reaction has proceeded too far. The core has begun to melt.  Engines will overload in 2 minutes, 35 seconds.
<s> It grows on you.
<s> That way.
<s> Damn it!  How long to fix?
<s> Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
<s> Here, let me try.
<s> We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it.
<s> Well we better do something.
<s> Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
<s> How about cutting it off?  We can't pull it loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it's stuck to his face.
<s> You can't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits...
<s> It wouldn't come.
<s> Can you do anything for him?
<s> I don't buy that.  There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.
<s> No.
<s> I think it's fizzled out.
<s> We sure need this flamethrower.
<s> <u>Don't touch him, watch it</u>!
<s> Let's let the machine work on him.
<s> Yes, thank heaven.
<s> We're going into the freezers now.
<s> Room by room, corridor by corridor.
<s> I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.
<s> And you and I will bag it, and then we'll take it to the ventral air lock, got it?
<s> Couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?
<s> What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
<s> Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
<s> Any microorganisms?
<s> Anything else?
<s> I agree.  This is the single most important discovery in history.
<s> Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine.  If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.
<s> They seem native to the planet.  It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity.  It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.
<s> Quit complaining; we're in space.
<s> Food-storage room!
<s> Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
<s> The man would need protection, obviously -- as well as some way to drive the thing before him.
<s> Let's be democratic.
<s> Okay.  First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
<s> Sure.
<s> We figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
<s> And?
<s> The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.
<s> That's what I mean.  This is the quietest I've ever heard it.  It's unnatural.
<s> Yeah?
<s> It's alright, it's cool...
<s> York just turned up outside.  We're trying to get him into Infirmary.
<s> Sounds great.
<s> Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
<s> Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions.
<s> How many... how many people are missing?
<s> Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
<s> I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
<s> Only six?
<s> Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
<s> Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right now.
<s> Alright.  Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign a release for the weapons.  Cassie, organise a team roster and put it on the board.
<s> What time's sundown?
<s> It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
<s> I believe I will.
<s> I hope you mean what you say, Eve. I intend to hold you to it.
<s> Paved with what, then?
<s> Why'd call me a killer?
<s> I'm in love with Lloyd!
<s> I don't want to make trouble. All I want is a drink.
<s> Miss Caswell is an actress. A graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts.  Ah... Eve.
<s> Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
<s> That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
<s> It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
<s> I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
<s> The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
<s> Where?
<s> We know you, we've seen you before like this. Is it over - or just beginning?
<s> Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten-  - and you're going to be on time.
<s> Call me when you get in...
<s> And who remembered it? Who was there on the dot, at twelve midnight...?
<s> The reading could have been better, but you said it - now "many happy returns of the day..."
<s> What?
<s> So you've pointed out, so often. So many qualities, so often. Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection - and so young. So young and so fair...
<s> - guilty.
<s> What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
<s> You wouldn't understand.  How was Miss Caswell?
<s> Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.
<s> I understand she is now the understudy in there.
<s> What would you like? Texas?
<s> Also Addison deWitt.
<s> So am I.
<s> I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
<s> Oh, brother.
<s> I'm sure that's very flattering, Birdie, and I'm sure there's nothing wrong with that!
<s> How did you get in here?
<s> Probably not.
<s> I'll just pick up the broken glass.
<s> I don't care if I never get home.
<s> But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
<s> Not at all.  Margo, this is Eve Harrington.
<s> My husband...
<s> I think I'd better. It's been - well, I can hardly find the words to say how it's been...
<s> I don't let myself think about it, even-  - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly...
<s> Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
<s> Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
<s> There can't be very much-
<s> - and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
<s> - an understudy's performance.
<s> Not at all...
<s> The four of you must have so much to say to each other - with Mr. Sampson leaving...
<s> Well, you've done so much... what's new?
<s> Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too "Seventeenish" for me...
<s> What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
<s> Three or four miles...
<s> We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
<s> More than anything in this world, I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can't tell they apart - how can he?
<s> Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
<s> Well... all right.
<s> Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-
<s> I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
<s> Now just a minute!
<s> Nothing much. She apologized.
<s> Nothing...
<s> Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!
<s> I doubt very much that you'd like her in 'The Hairy Ape'.
<s> The play? All right, I guess...
<s> Twentyish. It isn't important.
<s> That's beside the point.
<s> Lloyd, I want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe...
<s> You know, she probably means well, after all...
<s> What's your being married got to do with it?
<s> It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
<s> Well...
<s> It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.
<s> --Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
<s> About the past year.
<s> --she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
<s> It's safe, try it, you'll see.
<s> Go on, go on--
<s> --has he got an ax?--
<s> Then he's got an ax.  Call him anyway.
<s> Segovia begged me for me secret but I said, "No, Andres, you'll have to try and make it without me."
<s> --We got twenty minutes to deadline--
<s> Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
<s> Night.
<s> On the orders of Haldeman?
<s> --that was awhile ago--
<s> You're two months behind--you got enough to cover?
<s> We're a long way from high school, Carl...  ...and I'm scared.
<s> And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
<s> I will not talk about the other two.
<s> We're moving.  I've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. My name's been in the papers too much. Sometimes I wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. I'm not thinking of myself. But my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them.
<s> --it's gotta be Haldeman--someone from the White House had to be involved--
<s> --Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this--
<s> Electronic surveillance.
<s> Mitchell started the cover-up early, everyone is involved in the cover- up, all the way to the top. The whole U.S. intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities. The extent of it is incredible.  And people's lives are in danger, maybe including ours.
<s> It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.
<s> ...you're definitely doing a story...?
<s> I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.
<s> Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
<s> Mitchell knew then.
<s> --don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
<s> James McCord.
<s> ...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
<s> It may never come out.
<s> Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
<s> Nobody ever had too much.
<s> --well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?--
<s> The most powerful man in America is President Nixon, probably you've heard his name.
<s> Thanks, Harry.  Know anything about Colson?
<s> Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
<s> Could develop.
<s> Anyone but Bernstein.
<s> No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
<s> One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
<s> Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
<s> I'm not good in math.
<s> Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
<s> Pardon me?
<s> Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> No idea.
<s> Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
<s> So Oz, you almost made it, huh?
<s> You?  You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
<s> You can call me Oz.
<s> Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
<s> How did you know I was here?
<s> You talked to Stifler?
<s> Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great.
<s> What?
<s> I'm not playing.
<s> What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
<s> Then what the hell are you talking about?
<s> I do, baby, I do.
<s> Finch, you got the Latin homework?
<s> Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
<s> He's going in!
<s> You fuckin' rule!
<s> Do you know about the clitoris?
<s> Okay, well that about covers it.
<s> That's great.  Now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it --  "Stroke the salami!"  Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We <u>all</u> masturbate.
<s> Highly, highly overrated.
<s> Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
<s> Okay!
<s> "Fun loving" -- insane.
<s> Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded...
<s> Apple pie...  McDonald's or homemade?
<s> Oh that's really reassuring.  And don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a fraud.
<s> Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
<s> Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
<s> You've got something going?
<s> Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman, the boy.  I am now a man.
<s> For me?
<s> Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
<s> I am sorry, Jim.  I suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
<s> God dammit, Stifler!
<s> You think so?
<s> Kevin, this is serious!
<s> No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
<s> Yeah.  Are you sure?
<s> I love you.
<s> How the hell do you know all these random songs?
<s> Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Uhh! Would you die already!
<s> Also like sex with my wife.
<s> What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.
<s> AHHHHHHH!
<s> No it isn't! You're dead!
<s> Rip my face off? Hey, we all make mistakes. Hell, I didn't mean to sleep with you on the first night, especially without a condom. But I did, and now I'm paying the price.
<s> Oh, big man. You can beat up a couple of cadavers. Well let me make something real clear, asshole. If you don't kill yourself, at midnight tonight you're gonna transform and murder innocent people!
<s> Yeah... Ditto. I saw, er, I thought I saw you get munched... like Uncle Terrence...
<s> So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
<s> Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.
<s> I know. He told me.
<s> What?
<s> FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
<s> Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...
<s> Hey, I'm new here, what do you want?
<s> Sure. Don't you?
<s> Why isn't it doing anything!?
<s> What?!
<s> Oh no... no....
<s> But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
<s> Yeah, well if I claw my face off, just pack it in ice, okay? Jesus... the cops were probably right. My uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him.
<s> That's what Serafine is searching for. Without much luck, I'm afraid. If only we could speak with him. But alas, he's off in another realm, close to death.
<s> Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business.
<s> That's McDermott, but yeah.
<s> No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
<s> Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
<s> Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
<s> He says -
<s> Double merde.
<s> Get on! Anastasia, get on!
<s> She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to
<s> I'm fine.
<s> Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
<s> I have my reasons.
<s> That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs  ... stretch then that way.
<s> Trying... to... breathe...
<s> It's not you - it's the dress!
<s> Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
<s> I'm glad you	did too.
<s> Is it? Is this what you want?
<s> Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
<s> I cursed then all!
<s> Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
<s> Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
<s> It worked in Odessa...
<s> Rasputin!
<s> Promise me she'll have her home.
<s> Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
<s> This guy's on television.
<s> Alvy Singer over here!
<s> I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.
<s> What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".
<s> Okay, if that's all that we've been through together means to you, I guess it's better if we just said goodbye, once and for all! You know, it's funny, after all the serious talks and passionate moments that it ends here... in a health food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. Goodbye, Sunny.
<s> Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
<s> Yes.
<s> Why not?
<s> Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
<s> Tsch.
<s> You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
<s> M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
<s> Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
<s> I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
<s> Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.
<s> You-you play... very well.
<s> No, Chippewa Falls.
<s> Okay.
<s> You sure?
<s> Right. Well, I don't know, I mean, uh, some of her poems seem - neat, you know.
<s> Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So, anyway, so...  George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was...  shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War.  Anyway, so, so...  George is standing in line, oh, just a sec... uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So, so...  so, he's dead ...  he's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty unfortunate.
<s> Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
<s> You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
<s> That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like. Listen-
<s> It's terrific.
<s> Oh, all right.
<s> Yeah... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce.  Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that?
<s> Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
<s> I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
<s> That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
<s> Yeah?
<s> U-huh.
<s> Oh, yeah?
<s> Do I love you?
<s> Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
<s> 'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know, it's stimulating.
<s> Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
<s> Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.
<s> Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
<s> M'm.
<s> Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
<s> G-go on, I'm interested.
<s> Well, well, sure... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect. So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic... kind of insight.
<s> I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
<s> There's a spider in the bathroom.
<s> I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
<s> I'm sorry. I had the television set had the television-
<s> I don't know.
<s> Ah? Oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.
<s> What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
<s> Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?  Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God!
<s> Yeah, well, we have the, I mean, they were just a terrific audience, I mean, you know, it makes it really easy for me, because I can be... huh?
<s> And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
<s> I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
<s> Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause the Incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs.
<s> It's that they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.
<s> Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.
<s> Tsch, I know. A relationship, I think, is-is like a shark, you know? It has to constantly move forward or it dies.  And I think what we got on our hands  is a dead shark.
<s> Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.
<s> Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
<s> Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
<s> Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
<s> We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.
<s> Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
<s> The what?
<s> I have a headache.
<s> Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.
<s> Uh, oh, I don't know. It might have been Leopold and Loeb.  Hello. Oh, hi... Uh, no, what-what's the matter? What-what-what? You sound terrible... No, what- Sure I- Whatta yuh what kind of an emergency?... No, well, stay there. Stay there, I'll come over right now. I'll come over right now.  Just stay there, I'll come right over.
<s> It's a narrow view.
<s> Yeah, I love it there.
<s> You stopped smoking sixteen years ago, is that what you said? Oh, I-I don't understand. Are you joking, or what?
<s> Ah, Max, you, uh...
<s> Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
<s> You'll total the whole car.
<s> While you're out here, Max, I want you to see some of my TV show. And we're invited to a big Christmas party.
<s> Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
<s> I don't know, I mean, I-
<s> No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...
<s> No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met?
<s> She was stealing.
<s> I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
<s> I just have time to get the, uh-
<s> Yeah.
<s> Oh.
<s> I'm not that good.
<s> Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.
<s> Not this time.
<s> I...wait, what are you talking about?
<s> This is Monica and Ryan.  Mac and Clair.
<s> Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight.
<s> Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold.
<s> I love you, Joe Therrian.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> Did he promise?
<s> Beats a lawsuit.
<s> We're great.
<s> They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
<s> Panes is not on your team anymore.
<s> You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
<s> Dinner.  Don't be angry.
<s> It's a novel.
<s> Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
<s> I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
<s> I'll be with you.
<s> Me too.
<s> And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see?
<s> What?  Oh yeah, the camera man?  They gave me a list.
<s> No, he's absolutely right.  You're absolutely right, Ryan.  Dog talk must be banned.  Canine conversations are completely discouraged... it's really good of you to join us.  Can I get you a drink?
<s> Right away.  Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan?
<s> Very well put.
<s> I'll be your best friend.
<s> Lemon.
<s> Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
<s> This is an amazing present.  What a sweetheart you are.
<s> Time!
<s> No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck.
<s> He always has two or three going...
<s> Yes.
<s> I'm not going to leave you alone.
<s> Let's just go home, okay?
<s> How long ago was it?
<s> Oh?
<s> Thank you.
<s> Oh?
<s> Who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and Myaskovsky.
<s> It could be worse.
<s> I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
<s> I don't want to talk about it.
<s> I never like to talk about my work.
<s> It's just very distracting when you're trying to work.
<s> Rose.
<s> Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
<s> And here they are!
<s> Hm.
<s> The both of you.
<s> And the food sucks, I know.
<s> Not nice.  Not kind.
<s> Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
<s> No...as a matter of fact...
<s> Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
<s> Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
<s> Want a list?
<s> Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
<s> There's something going on, Z --
<s> Oh no...
<s> I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world.  Or beans.  Something like that.  Anyway, I've <u>got to warn the others</u>.
<s> It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?
<s> Duty calls!
<s> Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
<s> Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
<s> I...I have no idea, sir.
<s> Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a <u>food shortage</u>.  Well you boys are gonna be taken care of.  But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for <u>breakfast</u>, we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>lunch</u>, and we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>dinner</u>!
<s> Engaged?  As in you're getting married?
<s> Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
<s> But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.
<s> Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
<s> Maybe I'll get lucky.  You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...
<s> What do I do?
<s> From me the doctor has no secrets. Poor girl -- how could you do a thing like that?
<s> Well, I have some paper towels --
<s> Look, Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait around. I'll wash the dishes and --
<s> Really?
<s> I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
<s> Meet you in the lobby. Okay?
<s> Eight-thirty!
<s> I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
<s> You shouldn't.
<s> Cheers.
<s> Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
<s> I thought so.
<s> Let me help you.
<s> What kind of talk is that?  So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.
<s> My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
<s> I mean -- her apartment.
<s> Miss. 
<s> Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
<s> So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
<s> Pick up your cards and let's go.
<s> So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
<s> Sure.  What's that funny smell?
<s> I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --
<s> No -- just come as you are.
<s> You usually eat alone?
<s> Cheers.
<s> I'm fine all over.
<s> So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
<s> Gas?
<s> Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
<s> That's right, Baxter.
<s> Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway --
<s> That's good thinking, Baxter. Next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're executive material.
<s> Relax, Baxter.
<s> You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
<s> Now what was your news, Baxter?
<s> You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
<s> You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
<s> Now I'll have to borrow your key.
<s> No I didn't.
<s> Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
<s> What does he mean, accident?
<s> I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch.  You know I like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time?
<s> I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.
<s> Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.
<s> Listen, Baxter, we made you and we can break you.
<s> Hi, Doc.  Had a late call?
<s> Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
<s> Me?
<s> It's regulations.
<s> Aren't you?
<s> Sure, Doc.
<s> Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.
<s> You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.
<s> No.
<s> I said I had no family -- I didn't say I had an empty apartment.
<s> It's an emergency -- see you some other time.
<s> No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot!
<s> Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
<s> So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
<s> Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
<s> Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?
<s> First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
<s> Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?
<s> Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
<s> Captain Willard -- go ahead.
<s> We need all our fuel.
<s> Sure, thanks.
<s> Part.
<s> I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.
<s> Let's talk about you.
<s> You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them.  I swear to God I would have, too, if ...
<s> They lined us all up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib -- magnificent meat, beautifully marbled.. Then they started throwing it in these big cauldrons, all of it -- boiling. I looked in, an' it was turning gray. I couldn't stand it. I went into radio school.
<s> Probably is.
<s> That we're dumber than we look.
<s> Yeah, it is.
<s> Looks that way.
<s> I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile --
<s> No -- most of 'em are still standing -- might've been disease.
<s> Where ?
<s> First Air Cavalry. They're the ones gonna get us into the River.
<s> We found some bodies -- let's get out a here.
<s> I think this river wants to take us home fast. I'm practically goin' in reverse.
<s> This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
<s> If they have boats ... or canoes... they'd get lost in the fog. We can't move either -- we'll end up on the shore.
<s> You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
<s> Charlie?
<s> He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
<s> Looks like a two thousand pound to me. Yeah, a two thousand pound bomb.
<s> What about an American named Kurtz?
<s> We endure, captain -- you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar -- destroy that and we'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it. Burn the forest and we'll hide in the swamp. all the while, we do but one thing -- clean the blood off our bayonets.  Au revoir, Captain.
<s> It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.
<s> Just hold up a second, Captain -- I'll get to you soon enough -- We've got things to do here.
<s> Hairy ?
<s> Who?
<s> Yes, I know.
<s> I'm Kurtz.
<s> You know you're right.
<s> What Truth?
<s> You knew him best.
<s> I wasn't looking.. I was running.
<s> That's me.
<s> And shut up.
<s> We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.
<s> I'm sorry to hear that.
<s> The river is beautiful.
<s> Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
<s> 150  CONTINUED:
<s> 175  CONTINUED:
<s> 43   CONTINUED:
<s> 94   CONTINUED:  
<s> There isn't one, unless Corbett's men get here before the plane does.
<s> 168  CONTINUED:
<s> The radio's on the fritz.
<s> Be right back.  I left my camcorder in the car.
<s> Sure did.  He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.
<s> Can't help myself.  Corbett's type always pisses me off.  Oh, I found this at the post office.  Had your name on it.
<s> Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
<s> Yeah.  Maybe so.
<s> -- To take you to jail?  It'll be my pleasure.
<s> You got the belly to look me in the eye and pull the trigger?
<s> I've been on ice like this when I was a kid, skating.  Spread your weight, keep moving.  Go on.
<s> You don't get it, do you?
<s> How many do you see?
<s> Cowardly bastard.  I'm in handcuffs and I still scare the piss out of you.
<s> I liked you better frozen.  You didn't talk so much.
<s> You're wrong.  Everything we do leaves its mark.  You said it yourself -- there are hundred- year-old footprints in the tundra.
<s> I got it from here.  Thanks.
<s> Good idea.  Flying over mountains can give you some nasty surprises.  Go too low, one of the clouds might have a big rock inside it.
<s> Nothing personal.
<s> Back at my place... he, uh, broke his leg.
<s> There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
<s> Mobile Arctic Dwelling -- MAD.
<s> It's a long shot.
<s> We were just talking about him.
<s> On a good day I couldn't spare a crosswalk guard.  But now, no way.  Folks're batshit with the weather turning sour.  Bring him in yourself.
<s> Huh?
<s> Come on. Why fight when we know how it will come out. This isn't like stocking or a string of pearls. You don't send this one back.
<s> I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts.  This can't be right -- con- science.
<s> Everybody wants that, dear -- it doesn't exit...  Sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.
<s> No.
<s> What's wrong with your son, anyway?
<s> What's with the dark?
<s> You all set here?
<s> He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
<s> Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
<s> I want you to go on this trip.
<s> What's that got to do with it?
<s> Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
<s> Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
<s> You promised a nice place -- can't you just...  You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?
<s> I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
<s> Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
<s> Can we order first?
<s> That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?
<s> To hell with sex.
<s> Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
<s> I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
<s> ... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
<s> I had to see you...
<s> I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
<s> Yes. I really would.
<s> No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
<s> Why? What have you been thinking about?
<s> I'll take care of myself --
<s> You don't want to mess with me today. I'll figure something else out tomorrow.
<s> Sure -- take him to the vet.
<s> About a dog.
<s> I'll be able to keep my apartment and studio, won't I?...  Just tell me.
<s> Ask him.
<s> How're you doing?
<s> Maybe this can wait.
<s> Okay, then.
<s> That cleaning woman doesn't...
<s> Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
<s> Oh, my gosh.
<s> Never a break. Never.
<s> I'm going back with you.
<s> Look, we both want the dog -- and...
<s> How about that pose?  This is not fun...  Give me some direction.
<s> What restaurant?
<s> So you're from around here?
<s> Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.
<s> The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
<s> That's right.
<s> You would be.
<s> I don't give a fuck what you are.  I asked you --
<s> Do you want Rath or not?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> He stole another contract.
<s> $1,000,000.
<s> He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there?
<s> What?  How did you know I had a cat?
<s> Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
<s> The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
<s> Right.
<s> It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
<s> No.  It's the truth.  I know what you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  You don't have a social security number.  You don't pay taxes.  You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  You think you can do it again.  But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you.
<s> Just Electra?
<s> That's fiction.
<s> Nothing.
<s> I don't know.
<s> They saw you coming a mile away.  If I had known we'd be using --
<s> And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
<s> You killed him here?  In this city, outside that bank?
<s> Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
<s> Yes.  Here I am again.
<s> No.
<s> I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
<s> Jesus, if someone had --
<s> After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.
<s> Honestly?
<s> Shit.
<s> The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
<s> Electra --
<s> Yes.  Please come in.
<s> I'd love one.  Whatever you're having.
<s> It's a common question.
<s> That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
<s> Anything.
<s> No.
<s> It won't last, believe me. And you, when will you go back to the States?
<s> Yeah and they manage to go to bourgeois joints!
<s> That's Lubosh, the greatest fiddle player in Prague. You must have seen him playing with Johnny on the bridge. ......Come on, let's grab a table.
<s> This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.
<s> You've got to stop using that word "we" it's getting kind of scary. Right Katka?
<s> That makes you an expert I guess.
<s> Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.
<s> Thought of everything haven't you.
<s> Nope, not even close. I've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.
<s> Yes, but it suddenly clicked, this is going to be a crazy place and, since the Commies are used to seeking asylum, we can use that in the marketing.
<s> Can you do the lock on it?
<s> Don't we have enough already?
<s> Is it gone four-thirty?
<s> See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.
<s> Have you ever stolen anything?
<s> No, for the Asylum.
<s> Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
<s> You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
<s> Why don't we go together?
<s> You capitalist pig!
<s> He got that one right.
<s> I could try and get a Western lawyer.
<s> What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them?
<s> Get me one of the disks. Ask a Czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening. Put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to Reuters and be ready to send it, if this doesn't work. You'd better keep clear of your apartment too. Do you know someone with a phone?
<s> You're in the clear, keep it that way, I'll be okay.
<s> No, by road?
<s> Yes.
<s> No!
<s> Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
<s> No I'm not, I came to Prague looking for something - this could be it!
<s> What? You are crazy!
<s> There's nothing there for me.
<s> But I love you!
<s> No, it's not true, you're lying.
<s> It's not so much.
<s> Great....How long will it go for?
<s> Deal!
<s> Uh-huh!
<s> Not all of them!
<s> Working....Under cover.
<s> No way, he even gave me back pay.
<s> All the more reason to eliminate him.
<s> With you.
<s> I'll tell her you were here.
<s> And I have no idea why.
<s> Kelly wouldn't do that.
<s> Cuz nothing happened at school.
<s> -- I like the car I have.
<s> No. I won't be long.
<s> Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed --
<s> I didn't know either.
<s> No thinking. The doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
<s> No. Thanks. Gotta keep my wits for the drive home.
<s> Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ?
<s> Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
<s> 'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
<s> -- I know you don't suck at acting.
<s> Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
<s> And you have to meet my father.
<s> The world of the dead?
<s> That is my telescope.
<s> Don't you?
<s> Before the divorce. My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job.
<s> What would you do up here?
<s> The truth. I just left you out of it.
<s> You planned this --
<s> Because I had it named for you. I know it's not an official designation --
<s> I will.
<s> Yes.
<s> Up to?
<s> No. I want what's best for you.
<s> Ever again.
<s> How do you -- the two of you -- get by?
<s> I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
<s> I helped Jamie with the first one.
<s> She did. It was you.
<s> I'm no dummy.
<s> I'd work backstage or something?
<s> Then you remember more than I do.
<s> I didn't say you did.
<s> A similar triangle?
<s> Scalene?
<s> Fine.
<s> Oh, I'm feeling much better now.
<s> Oh, no, I'm fine...fine.
<s> You mean like how you're supposed to act with someone on a first date?
<s> What drill?
<s> Christ, it's a miracle I was even born! 
<s> No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
<s> Uh -- yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.
<s> Operator! Listen, this is an emergency! I have to make this call, but I don't have a dime -- all I got is a nickel -- but you gotta connect me --
<s> What?
<s> What's this all about?
<s> ...To be traveled through
<s> Get behind the shield! I'm about to release radiation!
<s> Then where the hell is he?
<s> Professor, can this thing send Shemp back in time?
<s> Sure! Listen -- we take the racing results from today's paper...
<s> The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.
<s> Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
<s> We don't....
<s> Believe me, Professor, running around on a nuclear test site can't be any more dangerous than what I've been doing.
<s> Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.
<s> It'll be fine, Marty.  You'll be fine. Good luck. He stuck his hand out and Marty shook it. But there was still a question that was nagging at him...
<s> We're at one and a half miles, so you're just a little over a mile from where you want to be,  Wait until minus 3 minutes before you go -- that should give you plenty of time, and it should be close enough to zero hour that they can't do anything to stop you. Park the truck at 800 and get in the refri-- the time chamber. Just be sure the nose of the truck is pointed at the bomb....the power converter will do the rest.
<s> Professor Brown grinned. I guess I'll see you in... about 30 years.
<s> What? 
<s> Sure,.
<s> Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
<s> Okay.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Not bad.
<s> No, he showed me one.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
<s> Long as my ammo held out... Right there's where you caught me.
<s> They're okay.
<s> I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.
<s> Sure.
<s> Well, it's not good enough.  Just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, Kit? Guy like you.
<s> What's your friend's name?
<s> Well, stop the world.
<s> There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
<s> I don't care.
<s> Okay, but I'm going to keep it for a souvenir...
<s> They're not going to listen to me. You either. Are you kidding?
<s> I don't blame him.
<s> Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Hold it right there.
<s> Who're you?
<s> The creatures?  They attacked you?  They tried to possess you?
<s> Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
<s> Vanished. Thin air.
<s> I look great.  Let's rock 'n' roll.
<s> It?  Who does?
<s> What is it, Tommy?
<s> Don't look at me, Buckaroo Banzai.  I failed flight school.
<s> Figures.  Anybody seen my scope?
<s> Don't shoot!
<s> John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
<s> Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
<s> My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you.  I'm a nobody.
<s> Who were you really trying to kill last night?
<s> Pretty terrible shot.
<s> I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...
<s> What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
<s> Any time.
<s> I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like me.
<s> She was killed, Penny.
<s> Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
<s> Penny--?!  Are you all right?
<s> I have a radio fix...
<s> John Whorfin will kill us!
<s> Why me?
<s> I didn't drop 'em.
<s> Doesn't look anything like her to me.
<s> Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
<s> She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.
<s> He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
<s> Really?...
<s> You wrote his scripts for him?
<s> What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?
<s> I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob-
<s> Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?
<s> To do what?
<s> No, what did it say?
<s> I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
<s> Have you read the Bible, Garland?
<s> Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
<s> See you, Charlie.
<s> You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie.  Your daily routine – you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory...
<s> Not at all. It's damned interesting.
<s> I don't know! I woke up, she was... God, you gotta believe me!
<s> We gotta call the police –
<s> Dammit, don't argue with me. You asked me to believe you – well I do. Now don't argue with me.
<s> ...Both maybe?
<s> Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle!
<s> You don't have to cover for him. It's noble of you, but these things happen in business.
<s> Mr. Lipnik.
<s> I'm checking in. Barton Fink.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Huh?
<s> What –
<s> Nine days – Tuesday –
<s> How's about it, Bart?
<s> It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Don't, Beth.  Don't lie to me.
<s> No.  I mean it, thank you.
<s> Yes you did.  I'm a big girl.  I can handle it.
<s> I don't need any help.
<s> She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
<s> Put your hands up!
<s> I know who you are.
<s> No.  I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night.
<s> I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
<s> Why not?
<s> You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
<s> No, thanks.
<s> I don't know.  But you do.
<s> Yes, you did.  They never tested you, did they?  But Internal Affairs knew.
<s> I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
<s> There's Pepsi in the fridge.
<s> What's it about?
<s> I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
<s> For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
<s> No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.  I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college.  I slept with her once.  She started following me around, taking my picture.  She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman.  It was awful.
<s> I don't know.
<s> What are you researching?
<s> Really.  What are you writing about.
<s> We fuck like minks.  We forget the rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
<s> I hope I helped you out.
<s> Rock and roll, Gus.  Johnny Boz.
<s> I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
<s> What is it you got between you?
<s> Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that.
<s> She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
<s> I'm not gonna get AIDS, pop --don't worry about it.  I always use a rubber.
<s> Why the hell not?
<s> That's her pussy talkin' --He gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger.  He winks at her.  The woman looks away from him, shaking her head.
<s> In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.
<s> Ain't that hard, son.  This young farmgirl, she got tired of all that attention goin' to her little brothers -- she fixed 'em.  Just like 'ole Hazel Dobkins fixed her whole family -- except young Roxy here, she didn't use a wedding present.  She used Daddy's razor.
<s> She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
<s> Are you vice?
<s> I'm Roxy.  I'm her -- friend.
<s> Let's get out of here.
<s> The whole thing – painting.
<s> I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.
<s> Annina Nosei.
<s> How about right now?
<s> I know.
<s> I hate this. Turn that off.
<s> Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
<s> Well, you said that.  You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you?
<s> Yes, but as a black painter –
<s> What?
<s> No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy.
<s> So then what?
<s> For real?
<s> Yeah... I'll paint on it.
<s> I guess it was a long time ago.
<s> Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
<s> Medicine, man! Like health food. I'm taking care of my health!
<s> C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
<s> I hadn't thought about it.
<s> Staten Island would be ok.
<s> A present I picked up for you.
<s> You only want one Big Mac?
<s> That's great.
<s> No name? That's ok. I'll just call you Big Pink.
<s> Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
<s> Jean Michel Basquiat.
<s> Yes, Boss.  If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
<s> No, actually I feel worse.
<s> I will relay the message.
<s> We do.
<s> Maybe you're right.
<s> You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
<s> Well, I could ... free up some time...
<s> Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
<s> Nope, I told her everything.
<s> Nor I, on the second.
<s> Jesus, Selina, you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... I mean, just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
<s> I don't know.  Till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing.
<s> Scared of Oswald, are you?  Why, if his parents hadn't eighty- sixed him you two might've been roomies, at prep school!
<s> It does to me.
<s> I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
<s> But who could've ... no, don't say it.
<s> What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham?
<s> Fred.  Fred?  He's ... actually he's been on an extended vacation, and --
<s> A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
<s> Point is, listen to them.  They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.  If it works, don't fix it...
<s> I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
<s> I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
<s> Too good?
<s> I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success.  As one grows older, one yearns for family.
<s> What is it?
<s> No apology necessary.  That's the first time in thirty years.
<s> There's a lovely inn just down --
<s> Alfred, am I pigheaded?  Is it always my way or the highway?
<s> Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
<s> It appears, sir, that someone has stolen the batsignal.
<s> Rather disappointed at how poorly I taught you proper housekeeping.  And quite well, it seems.  Thanks to you, son.  Thanks to you all.
<s> I'm so sorry to trouble you, but-
<s> My parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago.  Alfred has been supporting me ever since.
<s> Keep it.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
<s> Freeze, you're mad.  This capsule will slaughter thousands.
<s> Me too.  Great stems, though.
<s> Definitely.
<s> Can he save her?
<s> Don't make me kill you in front of the girl.
<s> Umm.  What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
<s> I wish I knew.
<s> But he's never said a word-
<s> She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
<s> She wants to kill you.
<s> Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
<s> As a team, the duncely duo protect each other.  But the Robin is young. Impetuous.  If I could get him alone-
<s> Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.
<s> Of trust. Tell me your plan.
<s> I've got to stop him.
<s> You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
<s> No. You said I. I killed them.
<s> Is he all right?
<s> Dr. Meridian...
<s> ...Batman, Alfred. I'm Batman.
<s> I'm flattered. Not every girl makes a super-hero's night table.  You might have some interesting insights into Two-Face.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> You like strong women. I've done my homework. Or do I need skin-tight vinyl and a whip?
<s> Maybe you just haven't met the right woman...
<s> Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
<s> Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
<s> Gracious even in defeat. How vaguely disappointing. When all this could have been ours together.
<s> So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
<s> So, this Riddler, he's dangerous?
<s> The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be...
<s> You understand obsession better than you let on.
<s> That's usually my line.
<s> Excuse me.
<s> What? This isn't normal?
<s> Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
<s> You do know. Try.
<s> Look, spare me the sermons, okay. You're just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed. You don't even know me.
<s> You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  I want better for you.
<s> Paranoid? The psychotic?
<s> Fred?
<s> Never heard of a double-cross?
<s> So not everyone can be a poet. Still, I respect the sentiment.
<s> Haven't you had enough? Don't Think And Drive.
<s> He won't kill her. -- GODDAMMIT!
<s> ... A hundred and eight?
<s> I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of you.
<s> You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.
<s> Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
<s> Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
<s> Then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. And I know what it is -- Now you'll have to kill me.
<s> Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
<s> I feel naked without it.
<s> Ohhhh... You don't mean that.
<s> He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
<s> I suggest a nice big bomb.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
<s> No shit.  It was all over the pavement.
<s> God!  How old are you?  There ain't no bat.
<s> All aver the world.  They say he's spent half of his life overseas.
<s> Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
<s> Bruce Wayne is out of his mind.  Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.
<s> Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
<s> Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
<s> It's okay.  There's no one out here. Just open the door.  Trust me.
<s> Now what does that mean?  My daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed, and I'm supposed to think it's amusing?  That tie's God-awful.  Why do you wear it?
<s> Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?
<s> Great.  Classic timing.  Why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce?  I'll check my diary later.
<s> Ahm.....
<s> Ahm.... .
<s> But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.
<s> Thanks, David.  Always a pleasure.
<s> Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.  I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
<s> Love to, sir, but no can do.  No spare room.  Period.
<s> And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
<s> Okay, sir.  Certainly.  Good.
<s> No. Perfect.  Looking forward to it. CUT TO:
<s> Glad to hear it.  Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
<s> Er ... pray tell me why?
<s> Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Congratulations. Marvellous thing.  Bravo.
<s> A car sounds sensible.
<s> It's you and Mom that need to talk.
<s> No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands, you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life.
<s> Bye, Bean.  Thanks for everything. And take care, huh?  I know it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.
<s> Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
<s> Me first?
<s> This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
<s> Dammit!!!! Dammit!!!!
<s> Uh, probably, huh huh...Whoa, I think my life is like, flashing in front of my eyes!
<s> Huh? Huh huh.
<s> Huh huh. Jack. Huh huh.
<s> C'mon, Beavis, just start running really fast when you hit the ground. It'll work.
<s> Uh... dill, um, face...
<s> That's alright. I'd rather not know your real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you ten grand plus expenses, all payable after you do her...
<s> Um, um, yeah, probably. Heh heh.
<s> Do you have any oleo? Heh heh.
<s> He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
<s> OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...
<s> Dammit!  Where's that damn unit??!!
<s> Bork, don't you realize what kids today are capable of? Don't you read the papers?
<s> That's better. Yes?
<s> Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
<s> Attention all units. We've got him. He's in front of a camper in the visitor's lot.
<s> Where are his pants?
<s> Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
<s> Uh, you want us to do a guy? Huh huh. No way.
<s> Helen got it for me in Oslo.
<s> I know... I just wish she'd leave us alone.
<s> De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
<s> What's she doing here?
<s> <u>You</u> left me.
<s> Draw door?  I don't know why we keep looking in that stupid book.
<s> No.  But it's somewhere without big worms.
<s> Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.
<s> I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
<s> Maybe we should knock first?
<s> Let's see if she can get my model back.
<s> We were trying to scare your mother.
<s> Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a businessman.  I'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beee</u>tel <u>Jooose</u>!  <u>Who</u> do I gotta kill?
<s> <u>Never trust the living</u>!  We <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.
<s> <u>Out</u>.
<s> What do you expect?  You're dead.
<s> No.  You don't want his help.
<s> I always tell the truth.  Of course I can see you.
<s> No, Lydia, we're dead.
<s> Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
<s> Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Good thing you are beautiful, kid. You are <u>dumb</u>!
<s> My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room.
<s> I'm lonely.
<s> Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
<s> I'm sorry already.
<s> Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!
<s> That's Charles' study.  But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it.  He's such a sheep.
<s> She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin...
<s> It's okay.  How's the dirt business?
<s> I understand. I've seen it done before.
<s> Yes.
<s> It's fine today, Robert.
<s> No, Robert.
<s> It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
<s> I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
<s> Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief...
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> I like to watch. This is fine.
<s> Yes.
<s> No. It won't do that.
<s> I am a very good gardener.
<s> Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.
<s> Yes, so do we.
<s> How is Ben feeling?
<s> Thank you, Eve.
<s> He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Yes. I like to watch.
<s> Hello, Eve.
<s> I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
<s> Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
<s> I don't want Robert.
<s> Your foot! Give me your foot!!
<s> Yes, I understand.
<s> Yes. I am very hungry.
<s> Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
<s> Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.
<s> You're looking much better today, Ben.
<s> Thank you, Ben.
<s> Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
<s> I like to watch.
<s> Hello, Ronald.
<s> I can't write.
<s> No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.
<s> I agree.
<s> Of course. I would like to look.
<s> ... Yes. You can take me.
<s> He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
<s> Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!
<s> Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It happens to old people.
<s> I'm going to work in the garden.
<s> I am a very serious gardener.
<s> ... The gardener?  ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
<s> Yes. I remember when he came. He was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book.
<s> You have me, I am here. What more proof do you need?
<s> Do you need a secretary?
<s> Hello, Sophie.
<s> Would you two excuse me for a moment?
<s> It's not that, I just...
<s> Look, Johanna...
<s> Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
<s> Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
<s> Good. Anything else?
<s> A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
<s> Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.
<s> It's that serious, huh?
<s> Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
<s> Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
<s> I... puppeteer.
<s> The ferret?
<s> No they're not.
<s> It'll never happen, fuckface.
<s> That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
<s> I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.
<s> I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
<s> Schwartz.
<s> Ah. yes, the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
<s> How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
<s> I'm right?
<s> Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
<s> You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
<s> It better be.
<s> I'll protect you, Dollface.
<s> Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
<s> How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
<s> The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
<s> A scary dream?
<s> Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
<s> Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
<s> All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
<s> Count me in.
<s> Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
<s> No, I didn't know that.
<s> That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
<s> One hour.
<s> Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
<s> Great then.
<s> You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
<s> Whatever you're having.
<s> Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
<s> What the fuck is going on?
<s> Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
<s> Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
<s> It's okay, my sweet.
<s> I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.
<s> Derek Mantini!
<s> What want ye, girl child?
<s> I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
<s> There was a boy there...said mama was a jailbird...said he could prove it..
<s> Then what do I do?
<s> ..."Here. Look here. See this mark? If you can't tell me by my face, look here."
<s> I don't know. I think I've lost my mother, Paul D.
<s> Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
<s> At times. At other times I think she was...more. But who would know that better than you. I mean, you sure 'nough you her.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Yes ma'am.
<s> I miss her.
<s> In case of what?
<s> Work? Start learnin your letters again?
<s> Well, what can you do?
<s> Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
<s> I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
<s> DADDY IS COMING FOR US.
<s> Morning, ma'am.
<s> Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
<s> But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. Come sit at the table.
<s> Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't know about. What she look like? You sure that wasn't Denver?
<s> You sure?
<s> Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
<s> You know she married Baby Suggs' boy.
<s> Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
<s> Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
<s> She what run you off? Not what I told you 'bout Sethe?
<s> Paul D.
<s> Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed?  I saw Denver. She tell you?
<s> Make it the way I always do.
<s> Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
<s> Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs.  Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.
<s> The?  Who the fff--
<s> Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
<s> Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed off?
<s> Shut the fuck up, Donny.
<s> Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit.
<s> I'm shomer shabbas.
<s> They won't hurt us, Donny.  These men are cowards.
<s> He's handicapped, huh?
<s> Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
<s> --smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC--
<s> Color?
<s> And what do you do, sir?
<s> Regrettably, it's true, standards have fallen in adult entertainment. It's video, Dude.  Now that we're competing with the amateurs, we can't afford to invest that little extra in story, production value, feeling.
<s> Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties.  If I can find your money, man-- what's in it for the Dude?
<s> Okay, Jackie, done.  I like the way you do business.  Your money is being held by a kid named Larry Sellers. He lives in North Hollywood, on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger. A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure your goons'll be able to get it off him, mean he's only fifteen and he's flunking social studies.  So if you'll just write me a check for my ten per cent. . . of half a million. . . fifty grand.
<s> Relax, man!  No physical harm intended!
<s> You're not interested in sex?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Mmnun.
<s> Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
<s> Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
<s> I want a child.
<s> What?
<s> Yeah man, it really tied the room together--
<s> Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you talking--I'm not--we're talking about unchecked aggression here--
<s> Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my--
<s> Am I wrong!
<s> No, you're not wrong--
<s> Well, just take 't easy, man.
<s> It's your roll--
<s> Well you're right, Dude, I got to thinking.  I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand--
<s> Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.
<s> Well call them up and explain it to 'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking simple, I'm sure they'd fucking understand it!  That's the beauty of it Walter!
<s> The nail polish, Walter.
<s> Now Dude--
<s> The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
<s> And yet his son is a fucking dunce.
<s> We know it's his fucking homework, Walter!  Where's the fucking money, you little brat?
<s> I understand.  That's why I picked up the phone.
<s> Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--
<s> Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?
<s> AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!
<s> I understand sir.  Could you slide your shorts down please?
<s> Are you employed, sir?
<s> I don't know, sir.
<s> Strong men also cry. . . Strong men also cry.
<s> No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me.
<s> I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY GOLDBRICKING ASS!
<s> I said out.  Now.
<s> Stay away from me, mister!
<s> Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
<s> Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
<s> It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
<s> Not good.
<s> He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
<s> Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
<s> So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
<s> You should've killed her, then.
<s> Wait.
<s> Don't even start, old man.
<s> Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.
<s> I know.  Just be quick about it, will you? Do it right.
<s> Who is LaMagra?
<s> There is no cure.
<s> I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night.
<s> I've been better --
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> There's only one alternative to the serum.
<s> What?
<s> Sometimes --
<s> The other elders will never let you get away with this!
<s> Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest.
<s> You've been bitten by a vampire. We've got to try and burn out the venom, just like a rattlesnake bite --
<s> You've been listening in the whole time?
<s> No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something.
<s> How?
<s> Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
<s> --which she may have--
<s> --bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
<s> Trying to find the energy.
<s> Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
<s> Mrs. Leavitt--
<s> --it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
<s> I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
<s> --Nick!!
<s> She <u>is</u>--she's helped solve a bunch of murders: Arizona, New Mexico--
<s> --<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
<s> Why is there no "our" here?
<s> --fine, later, fine.
<s> We've looked at half of one tape.
<s> No.
<s> I know, I know.
<s> What? That made her lose the baby?
<s> Who do you know who can? Where do we go?
<s> If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
<s> Hey, Mr. Graduate Fucking Thesis here was s'posed to be driving!
<s> No.
<s> --Cotter: shut up.
<s> Su casa y shit-o hole-o.
<s> Don't have one.
<s> --anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
<s> Heather, does that look like Domini there?
<s> The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
<s> --Graduate Thesis--
<s> Fine.
<s> I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car.
<s> Ah, Domini?
<s> No. I don't think so.
<s> Why she kills children.
<s> That they'll start touching us inside our heads.
<s> She's off her fucking rocker--
<s> We're not dealing with fucking logic here!
<s> --or Lyme Disease or poison sumac, or God knows what-else we could have picked up in the woods.
<s> You're needed here--keep watching--
<s> I thought all witches were benign and good.
<s> Does she, goddamnit??
<s> Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
<s> --his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
<s> Any time. But you don't have to worry about a thing for a while. Marty went down to Corpus yesterday.
<s> What?
<s> I don't know, he didn't say anything.
<s> I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?
<s> I said you're bad.
<s> Yeah.
<s> ...What do you mean?
<s> I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> ...What was that?
<s> What do you want to know?
<s> What?
<s> ...Friday?
<s> I don't know... I just think maybe I'm making a mistake...
<s> I don't know. Motel... Abby--
<s> What do you mean...
<s> No. It just made them feel better.
<s> So it would seem.
<s> Where?  ...I'm very careful about that.
<s> No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
<s> What?
<s> You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
<s> Okay honey.
<s> Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
<s> Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
<s> You did? A human ear?
<s> Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh my God. Is her son OK?
<s> If you want to.
<s> No way. get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
<s> Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
<s> I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
<s> . I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.
<s> No.
<s> Do you know?
<s> Then don't talk about killing.
<s> I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
<s> Yes.
<s> Frank would open you.
<s> Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
<s> If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
<s> Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
<s> Yeah. What are you doing now?
<s> I don't know. he moved away.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
<s> Alright. Good luck, yourself.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
<s> First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
<s> I'll drink to that.
<s> It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
<s> Could you wait a little while. this key may not fit.
<s> Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. you know what I mean?
<s> . OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
<s> . Actually. I've been in twice.
<s> Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
<s> Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?
<s> Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
<s> You want to go talk to him?
<s> That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
<s> Jeffrey!!
<s> Jeffrey. are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey. I mean it.
<s> What is it?
<s> I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
<s> Go ahead.
<s> Be right down.
<s> Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
<s> You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
<s> Looks like you'd make a good runner.
<s> That sounds great!
<s> Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.
<s> I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
<s> No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
<s> You'll see for yourself.
<s> Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
<s> I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole.  Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here.  I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen.
<s> It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
<s> You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
<s> Don't be ridiculous, these are my babies.
<s> Nice doing business with you, George.
<s> Yeah.  She told me.
<s> No fucking way.
<s> Get me a six pack.
<s> Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must be your lawyer.
<s> Good night.
<s> Now do you see what I am saying?
<s> Allo?
<s> I just got released five minutes ago.
<s> Okay.
<s> What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
<s> Well, you better get here fast.  I'm sitting on...
<s> Just sell it, Derek.
<s> We're half a million off.
<s> Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point five.
<s> Try the closet.
<s> Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us?
<s> What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
<s> I've seen those in magazines.  They're not cheap.
<s> Un sapo?
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
<s> Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?
<s> Family.
<s> I'm going to California.
<s> That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
<s> Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
<s> Not mad.
<s> Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now.
<s> I heard.  Ermine, your son is here.
<s> Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
<s> What do you guys want?
<s> What about him?
<s> No thanks, fellas.  You've got the wrong fucking guy.  I'm not a rat.
<s> He's getting middled, too.  And Derek's our partner.  What's good for us is good for him.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> Why are you smiling?
<s> I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
<s> Oh fucking relax.  Let your hair down for once.  It's your fucking birthday, for Chrissakes.  You're such a fucking pussy.  I swear to G-d, I married this big time drug dealer and wound up with the maid.
<s> My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy.
<s> I'll be here.
<s> Shhhh.
<s> We'll do that tomorrow, okay?  It's lockdown time.
<s> Yes, I do.
<s> Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
<s> Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's an extra two-hundred large.
<s> Yes, I am.
<s> Actually, I've got some news.  That fifty thousand I promised you, I couldn't get it.
<s> What?
<s> Fuck yeah.  I never seen nothing like it.  I'm fucking wasted.
<s> Right.  And Holyoke.  There are a hundred thousand rich kids with their parents' money to spend, but there's never anything available.  Nothing good, anyway.  I'm paying four hundred dollars for shit.
<s> The successes obtained are the results of those methods. One presupposes the other and vice versa.
<s> Let's try to be precise then. The word "torture" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... What type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?
<s> Sid Ahmed.
<s> You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
<s> No, it's better if he doesn't. The house is filled with new people.
<s> Here?
<s> Let's try ...
<s> It's a question of habit ...
<s> Good evening, sir.
<s> For many months, I've had your photo on my desk together with a dozen or so reports on you ... And naturally, I am under the illusion that I know you somewhat. You never seemed the type, Kader, inclined to performing useless actions.
<s> She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.
<s> So -- where do we start?
<s> Joe Koehler.  I know him.  He's an estate attorney -- and he's very expensive.
<s> How?
<s> It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
<s> You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
<s> Then she's not as smart as I thought she was.  You've seen her in the depositions.  Tell me you don't have any doubts?
<s> Back off, John.
<s> I'm talking to you as a friend now. Don't ruin your life, your career for her.  She'll spit you out when this is over.
<s> Your Honor, I'm trying to establish the sense of betrayal Miss Lawson felt when she discovered the man she lived with was a different person than she thought he was.
<s> Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women.
<s> You get his statement?
<s> No.
<s> A little after eleven.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> Fine.  The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.
<s> She didn't.  She just left.
<s> Thank you.  The State rests.
<s> Well -- I realized that she wasn't interested in me.  She was just trying to get information out of me.
<s> Yes -- Insulin and others.
<s> That's all Dr. Paley.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> Oriental medicine.
<s> Then -- those are not your own words?
<s> Yes -- cocaine.
<s> What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
<s> You're lying.  Marsh was wearing a cast on the tape.  It was right before he went to Chicago and met Miss Lawson.  He dumped you for her, didn't he?
<s> Well - I'm a little confused.  This is a charge receipt from Rosen's Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an account.  It's dated the day of the murder.  Is this your signature?
<s> A.M -- or P.M.?
<s> Why'd you come here?
<s> Frank -- what are you doing here?
<s> I'll have you out in a few hours.
<s> If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
<s> No -- it just doesn't look right.
<s> I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
<s> I hardly know him.  He wanted me and he couldn't have me.
<s> It won't be that hard.
<s> She's mistaken.
<s> I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
<s> I don't know, Frank -- but don't you think that's something we should find out?
<s> I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
<s> What does that mean?  You've been thinking about the case?  Or you thought everything out before you killed Marsh?
<s> Tonight we open new doors.
<s> Is Mom yelling at you too?
<s> -- But it's Sunday.
<s> Mr. Roston?
<s> Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
<s> You better.  Please answer the question.
<s> I'm always open to learning new things.
<s> Attractive.  Bright.  Distant. Charming when she wants to be.
<s> That's too bad.
<s> It's not that long.
<s> He's not coming.
<s> Well, there's a problem.
<s> Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
<s> Sshhh. "After going through the safety deposit box, I'm sure you'll find you're way to this letter. It's hard to write this to my own children. I could let this die with the rest of me, I suppose.  But as one gets older, one fears subside. What becomes more and more important is to be known -- known for all that you were during this brief stay. Row said it seems to me to leave this earth without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were. It's easy for a mother to love her children no matter what -- it's something that just happens. I don't know if it's as simple for children. You're all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong. But I thought it was important to give you that chance. To give you the opportunity to love me for all that I was..."
<s> Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
<s> Was this during Betty?
<s> -- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
<s> You're right -- that is sick.
<s> I'd kill him. Him and that Redfield woman. Together. First one then the other. And then I'd laugh.
<s> Oh, yes.
<s> Heat is heat.
<s> No. I was just going to have some iced tea then split the atom, but that can wait.  I just have to get my shoes.
<s> After the divorce.
<s> Sure.
<s> I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.
<s> Why?
<s> Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
<s> I think so.
<s> Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
<s> She starts sniffing me.
<s> No, you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away.
<s> You want to go back in?
<s> What?
<s> I never got lost. For some reason, I'm more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I'm kin to everyone, and no one in particular. See, once you get into the habit of not needing anyone, it's kind of hard to break.
<s> What made you ask such a question?
<s> Wonderful. Uh...
<s> Oh, how is he?
<s> I had a temper.
<s> You're right, you know. We don't have much time.
<s> No.
<s> Yes, thanks.
<s> What?
<s> I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything.
<s> The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
<s> Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
<s> Later. Go back to sleep.
<s> I can't sleep.
<s> I'm going to miss you.
<s> What's her name?
<s> I don't remember!
<s> Cremated?!
<s> WHAT!
<s> Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here.
<s> What the hell you talking about?
<s> Spooked?
<s> Or just Hell-adjacent...
<s> It ain't the money - it's the high.  The big fat floating 'what if?'  And it's way more profitable.  Nobody ever wins.  So you never have to pay out.
<s> Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
<s> Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
<s> Then fuck it!!!
<s> I manage them.
<s> If I did, I wouldn't come within fifty yards of your door.
<s> Back here.  At the end of the block.
<s> Can't be done.  That place already died and gone to hell.
<s> A little business move I made.  On my own.  I think you're gonna approve.
<s> You were just a kid.
<s> Daddy?
<s> Or you didn't know what to do with it.
<s> What building?
<s> That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
<s> You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
<s> Whattaya think?  Can you picture it? Over there the bar, and in here -- the dance floor.
<s> Save him?  What are you talking about?
<s> Then your father's a dead man and Jimmy Bones is gonna be around a long time.
<s> How could that be?  The box was packed!
<s> Just admit it, Caesar.
<s> Caesar, I don't know what you're thinking here, but if you don't put down that gun --
<s> Yeah, I know.
<s> That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> What are you, drunk?
<s> All right, Caesar.
<s> But it could be anywhere.
<s> This is insane!
<s> Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
<s> What?
<s> I had to.  You made me.
<s> They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit.
<s> Yes, I understand.
<s> Sure, Gino, sure.
<s> Pretty good, sir.
<s> Lick me.
<s> Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face.
<s> Why?
<s> Are you okay, Violet?
<s> I thought I heard someone knocking.
<s> Yeah, that's it.
<s> The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom.
<s> Gunfire?  Is this a joke?
<s> I knew it.
<s> Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
<s> He was in love with you, right?
<s> Is that what you think?
<s> Do you think you know me like that?
<s> To let it dry.
<s> Does the case lock?
<s> Johnnie?
<s> Like each other?  They hate each other.
<s> Yeah.
<s> We're almost there, Violet.  just hang on.
<s> Don't be sorry.  Help me.
<s> Pop?
<s> Caesar wants me to stay.
<s> I think everything is okay.
<s> You're asking me a direct question?
<s> -- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
<s> Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
<s> Look, maybe I should just...
<s> Did you?
<s> Then I'll find another ride.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
<s> I dream I'm asleep.  I dream that I'm asleep and I can't wake up.  I don't think I smoke.
<s> I guess so.
<s> -- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
<s> You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
<s> -- how? --
<s> xxxxxx
<s> If you're lucky.  Take it.  There's enough in there to make a life.  Any life.  Just get out now. Get low.  Stay low.  <u>Take it</u>.
<s> This your store?
<s> -- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
<s> That's the only angle.
<s> Hang on... 
<s> Abbott wants to talk.
<s> All of them?
<s> Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
<s> Where am I?
<s> I told you.  You need to rest.
<s> ... have a look.
<s> It's reply paid.
<s> Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
<s> I'm waiting for my daddy.
<s> On yes. Our morale is much higher than theirs, we're fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and pretty consistently knocking them for six. I'd say they're nearly out of the game.
<s> Beginner's luck.
<s> Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
<s> Where's Jill? What have you done to her? Where is she?!
<s> Even later.
<s> Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful - remember me to Alison - and the - er - twins.
<s> Ah ...
<s> Not really, no.
<s> He's a freelance subversive?
<s> She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
<s> Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
<s> Er ... alright. For Christ's sake don't lose it. Here, you'd better sign for it.
<s> Do you know what you're doing.
<s> Sam ... we're proud to have you at Information Retrieval. Merry Xmas. 
<s> I do. Goodbye. 
<s> There are no coincidences, Sam. Everything's connected, all along the line. Cause and effect. That's the beauty of it. Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them.  This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. Bye bye.
<s> Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
<s> Well, all wars do -
<s> What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
<s> Get away!
<s> Stop it ... damn you!
<s> Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us!
<s> Oh God! What have we done?
<s> C'mon. We've got to get out of here.
<s> Take care.
<s> You don't exist any more. I've killed you. Jill Layton is dead.
<s> It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have £31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.
<s> 27156789/074328/K.
<s> Here we are. Pink and blue receipts. All you've got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.
<s> You are good to me Sam.
<s> Yes.
<s> What's the matter?
<s> Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
<s> Ah.  Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
<s> She didn't say anything about it to me.
<s> I won't be held responsible.
<s> A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so.  Monsieur?
<s> What is it?
<s> Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
<s> Actually, I've decided ...
<s> There was a slight complication. Dr. Chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. Nothing to worry about. He's promised me I'll have these bandages off in a ...
<s> I know, I know ...!
<s> Numero trois, steak.  Monsieur, Mesdames, Bon appetit.
<s> Hello. Mr Lowry?
<s> Central Services.
<s> Fixed itself.
<s> Emergency procedures.
<s> Who fixed your ducts?
<s> Why not? All you've got to do is blow yer nose and fix it, haven't you?
<s> Thermostat's gone. And then some.
<s> Are you saying this is illegal?
<s> You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
<s> What if there is no tomorrow?
<s> Sleeping in the back.
<s> I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it?
<s> No.
<s> Ten-four, hon.  This is for you.
<s> No, I'd better not.
<s> What?
<s> You never know.
<s> Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
<s> Our Lady of Misery.
<s> You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago?  When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?
<s> Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
<s> We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
<s> No, no.
<s> I need to sit down a minute.
<s> She's no whore, Marcus.
<s> I need a drink, that's all.
<s> Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.
<s> Can't tell. It was a breech, twins. The other one seems okay, though. Marcus is taking him and the mother to Maternity.
<s> Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives.
<s> I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
<s> You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
<s> That's ridiculous.
<s> What?
<s> I'm not hungry.
<s> Relax, will you.
<s> One more time!
<s> You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
<s> Why don't you lead?  I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
<s> And the rule was...
<s> The pointers were great.  I'll study the tape.
<s> Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry.
<s> Why?
<s> A half hour in the lobby.
<s> Sure.
<s> This conversation is not worthy of you.
<s> Did you shoot their boots?
<s> Can you believe it?  I just risked my life for a network that tests my face with focus groups.
<s> I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
<s> I'll come by your place, right after...drink, take pills... Love you.
<s> They're not that dumb, after all.
<s> You too.
<s> You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
<s> Define your terms.
<s> No.
<s> Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.
<s> I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
<s> I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him...  ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.
<s> Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it.  I think it could turn them around.
<s> I'll speak to you soon
<s> I'll be right down.  It's right tight.
<s> He said something about...
<s> Should I...
<s> Right there, Bobbie.
<s> Bobbie, please.
<s> My roommate's very social -- somebody from Justice was over and...I always hear things before they happen.  Hey, and from now on, so do you.
<s> Thanks a lot, Buddy.
<s> No.  Really...don't worry about it.
<s> What do you mean?  You're one of the few people in this town I can talk to.
<s> No.  But, honest.  What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?  I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick."
<s> So great -- right?
<s> Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
<s> 'Really a lot appreciate it...'
<s> And it has nothing to do with the fact I left your room instead of staying there?
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.
<s> Why, you need me for the story?
<s> Who?
<s> You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
<s> Good night??!
<s> Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
<s> Why did I have to do this to myself?  Watch you take off.  Call me if you need anything.
<s> It would never occur to me to worry at all about you.
<s> Through the closet.
<s> There there...
<s> Walter!  Jeez!
<s> Yes Walter.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
<s> Why not?!
<s> Just about anything, Walter.
<s> Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
<s> What are you doing here so early?
<s> I don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid.  It was out there...
<s> No man, he ain't the type.  He don't get enough vitamin E.
<s> Well it sure looks dead enough.
<s> Well...
<s> You want me to open a window or something?
<s> Yeah, why?
<s> Well Why not?  I gotta make statues Leonard.  You heard Maxwell, they want me to make them.  I can't go back to being a busboy!
<s> I can't talk right now.
<s> Walter shut up and relax!
<s> "Let them die, and by their miserable death become the clay in his hands, that he might form an ashtray or an ark -"
<s> I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
<s> I thought you didn't respect money!
<s> What do you get?
<s> Oh no, I couldn't do that.  Mrs. Swicker would start asking questions. She's my landlady.
<s> Gee.  Thanks.
<s> Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
<s> What's the matter with you!
<s> Amazing!
<s> No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.
<s> Get away from here.
<s> Guys.  The environment.  I'm telling you, it's totally key.  The earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, Sting's doing it.
<s> Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
<s> Hey, it works for me.  If they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...
<s> It's the news, Buffy.
<s> You weren't home.  Like always.
<s> Buffy.
<s> Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
<s> I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
<s> A dress.
<s> For the dance.
<s> Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
<s> Buffy, there's no way you're going out there alone.
<s> Get away from me!
<s> Like my homework.
<s> Yeah, whoops I came.
<s> Did you ever dream that you were someone else?
<s> In Virginia.
<s> Lothos.
<s> I have to show you.
<s> Cramps?
<s> It's true.
<s> Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
<s> And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
<s> Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
<s> They were vampires?
<s> Try to pay attention.
<s> What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
<s> I...
<s> Five.
<s> Not if you're careful.
<s> It's what I was raised to do.  There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.
<s> As for example, what?
<s> You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
<s> Cassandra, you gotta come, too.
<s> Cassandra's really smart.
<s> Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
<s> My parents have money...
<s> She has died.  You are the next to be called.  Why do you think you were sent to me?  Trained as you were?  You bear the mark.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Oh, baby!
<s> Okay.
<s> Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --
<s> Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
<s> Weird?  You mean like you hanging out with that homeless, Poke?  I saw you last night after the game.
<s> As long as there's room for three in it.  What, didn't you bring your new friends?
<s> Would you rather me be making love to him, using your name, or making love to you, using his name?
<s> If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
<s> Not that.  I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
<s> Get over here.
<s> You don't have to...
<s> So am I.  Nuke, honey, we need to talk--
<s> That's great!
<s> I think I'm ready for the Show.
<s> I got lured.
<s> He's a virgin.
<s> What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
<s> Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's
<s> I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
<s> I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home...
<s> Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
<s> How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
<s> He'll learn.
<s> Oh let's not...
<s> Which one of us?
<s> Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
<s> I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already.  A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
<s> God damn it I'm sick of you calling me "Meat"!  You wanta step outside!
<s> It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
<s> Fear and ignorance.
<s> I don't need a crazy woman in my life.
<s> You too...Meat.
<s> The Crash Davis. ) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3-- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear.
<s> And where can I go?
<s> What're you thinking about out here, Nuke?
<s> Pussy.
<s> C'mon, Meat.  You can't hit me 'cause you're starting to think about it already, you're starting to think how embarrassing it'll be to miss, how all these people would laugh.  C'mon, Rook--show me that million dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good idea about the five cent head--
<s> We'll pray anyway.
<s> Looking for Crash Davis.
<s> Where does he go?
<s> They called me up to the Show and I wanta tell Crash goodbye.
<s> Good to see ya.  William would you...
<s> Philip, if you would rise.
<s> I'm serious. No interference.
<s> It's a pity in this...
<s> What do you propose?
<s> Yeah.
<s> All right, take care.
<s> Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay?
<s> Okay.
<s> If his girlfriend was knocked up.
<s> Hey.
<s> You mean, I have your permission?
<s> Me? That's why the bosses sent me out here. They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. Like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [EDDY and JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?  Yeah, right, I'm sure.
<s> Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
<s> ...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
<s> Then he called me a faggot.
<s> What? Ho-  Hey, come here.
<s> I'm sorry about this. Really.
<s> You're still eight pounds over.  What's the reason for this?
<s> What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
<s> Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.
<s> You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the boss.'  That's quiet?
<s> Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad.
<s> ...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
<s> Yeah.
<s> A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
<s> Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
<s> No, a...
<s> Why?
<s> Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.
<s> Yeah, she's with that cocksucker again... and they got Amy.
<s> I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
<s> Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
<s> No. Just stop everything.
<s> L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
<s> Who's this?
<s> Ginger's mission in life was money.
<s> I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.
<s> Hey, Mitch.
<s> Thank you.
<s> I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
<s> I - I - I...
<s> You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
<s> Okay.
<s> Now look,  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
<s> Well, why don't you take it out of your account? There's a lot there.
<s> I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
<s> No, he didn't.
<s> Yeah, how do I know?
<s> What? What?!
<s> First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
<s> I'll go, but I want my money right now!
<s> I'm going to the bank and I'm getting my jewelry too!
<s> What'd you have?
<s> You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
<s> I know you were with somebody. Who was it?  I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.  I just hope it's not them.
<s> Let me tell you something.  Listen to me.
<s> You understand? What? Let you go?
<s> So what? So who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in... huh?
<s> You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
<s> I'm not -
<s> Oh, you are...
<s> What are you running for, Bob? What are you running for?
<s> We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
<s> Eight children! 
<s> I really think you're -
<s> I really think you're overreacting in this whole -
<s> Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
<s> Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?
<s> You call yourself a man? You know you're a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off?
<s> Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
<s> Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
<s> Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
<s> Well, I've been busy. 
<s> That's not a problem, that's not a p-
<s> Lady, I can't. I can't. I ca-
<s> We're waiting on Carmine.
<s> I know.
<s> Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business.
<s> That's enough now!
<s> Mm.
<s> Mm.
<s> All right.
<s> But I knew how to keep the bosses happy. Whenever they gave me little jobs to do, you know, to send a message, I would carry things out...
<s> Pleasure.  Very nice to meet you.
<s> No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
<s> Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
<s> I do.
<s> No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
<s> 'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
<s> Sure did.
<s> Yes, you are.
<s> Come on. Don't be scared.
<s> If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
<s> You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
<s> What's the matter?
<s> What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
<s> Get lost?
<s> Come on! 
<s> Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
<s> It means I got the money.
<s> We're going to Europe. Let the adults talk.  You dye your hair... you get plastic surgery, like we talked about. Right? You're the mother. How much do you think he's gonna pay to get this fuckin' kid back?
<s> What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
<s> Are they out now?
<s> What a smart kid you are!  Okay, eat.
<s> Hold it, hold it. Here.
<s> Get up.
<s> I took care of everybody.
<s> Remo.
<s> ...to a tee. Like the time Tony Dogs...
<s> It's up to you.
<s> So are we.
<s> You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
<s> I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know?
<s> Fuck you!
<s> Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
<s> How you doin'?
<s> Well, I'm a little confused here.
<s> I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth.
<s> You know, I - I'm too upset right now. And - An end has to be put to this.
<s> Yeah.
<s> It's okay. Let her go.
<s> Guilty. I am.
<s> I don't know. I can't remember.
<s> You're probably right.
<s> What's the matter?  What are you saying?
<s> It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
<s> We'll hunt him down together...
<s> I lied.
<s> Oh, how long have you had your own route?
<s> Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight..
<s> I hate innocent bystanders.  Whine, whine, whine. Will he settle?
<s> "Well done," Cactus.
<s> I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
<s> How could I forget. Mammoth--go pet the kitty.
<s> Now he'll be up all night...
<s> Of course it matters!  It throws off everything!  "Superhero" is manhood's highest achievement. Manhood!  Your dirty little secret has diseased us to the core. You were my buddy, my comrade-- women aren't buddies, women aren't warriors!  You tried to turn the Cult of Good into some after-work softball team!  It's time to get thrown from the treehouse...
<s> And...your point?
<s> I know, I should probably tell you, but I just don't feel like it. To be honest, I'm really angry at you. I admired you so much more when you were purely wicked. I mean, look at you now, running around trying to "get to the bottom" of things. Trying to "save the city." It's true we're about to do a very nasty deed, but really, what's it to you?  Since when do you care what happens to a bunch of pathetic Oasiburgians? You're just not yourself, anymore.
<s> The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City...
<s> Enough.
<s> Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
<s> What did--?
<s> You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
<s> We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
<s> Where do you think you're going?
<s> This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
<s> Theo wants to talk again.
<s> Then whose is it?
<s> See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury.  On the job.
<s> With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
<s> That's what I deserve for listening in the first place.
<s> Just like they say; no fucking self control.
<s> Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
<s> I was worried about you.  Both of you.
<s> I don't believe you.
<s> My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
<s> I realize you don't want to be involved.
<s> Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
<s> What are you doing now?
<s> They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun.
<s> Shit, stop with the money!  I never asked for a nickel.  I was just doing this.  And you have to fuck it up with a price tag.
<s> That's not her.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.
<s> But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
<s> Hi Lenore.  It's me.  I got you back.  Courtesy of Star 69.  Are you hurt?
<s> Are you okay?
<s> Your husband?
<s> Do you have to point that?
<s> I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
<s> You wouldn't --
<s> The money, Nels ... ?
<s> Why are we stopping?
<s> Local lawyer for Dominican dealers.  Off to buy a half interest in a mall in Granada Hills on their behalf.
<s> Take your hand out of there. Slowly.
<s> Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
<s> Keep talking.
<s> It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from?
<s> Some loyalty.
<s> Tell the lady to relax.  Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person.
<s> You'll see her.
<s> You'll still have the girl and the husband.
<s> Soon as Mrs. Oberfeld is in my car I'll toss out your first third. Then I'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom.
<s> Don't worry.
<s> Better reassure him.
<s> There's two police cars now.
<s> And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
<s> Sweet revenge plus maybe a bit of vigorish off your end.
<s> Take the 405 south.
<s> Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
<s> If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
<s> Mind if I have a look?
<s> How?
<s> Nice.
<s> What do you think his name is?
<s> Bloody right I do...
<s> Yes, thank you.
<s> You can't leave me then, can you?
<s> They're jealous.
<s> I wonder.
<s> Like what?
<s> Yes, please.
<s> Whiskey.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Where?
<s> Don't call me that.
<s> Do you care, Jimmy?
<s> You mean that?
<s> When?
<s> You can always pretend.
<s> I miss you, Jimmy.
<s> Don't be cruel.
<s> Delirious.
<s> Yes.
<s> Sorry. What you doing?
<s> I will be.
<s> Did you hear me?
<s> I suppose I tried.
<s> Don't you want to kill me?
<s> Stop it, Dil --
<s> I like you, DIl
<s> Never.
<s> Yes. Say hello to Col --
<s> Thirty-five.
<s> Horny bastard.
<s> He's hot.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> So I suppose a fuck is out of the question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No sudden moves. And not a whisper to her. You'll be hearing from us.
<s> Yes?
<s> Some judge...
<s> Do you want a cup of tea?
<s> The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
<s> Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.
<s> I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
<s> Peter.
<s> Would make me feel better about it.
<s> I'm sure.
<s> Yeah.
<s> So, what do I look like?
<s> Could you?
<s> So I've noticed.
<s> She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.
<s> What the fuck were you doing here?
<s> Having a pint in the Rock.
<s> Some kinds of women are...
<s> Want you to do something, Fergus.
<s> If they kill me --
<s> A story.
<s> And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
<s> Stop that talk now --
<s> What you say, faster?
<s> Hurling --
<s> You'd know I wouldn't run off.
<s> You're crazy --
<s> First her husband, now her -- she hoodwinked you! She batted all them big eyes and you went 'n fell for it - like a egg from a tall chicken! Here!  You want? Here -- it's yours!
<s> That's right.
<s> It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
<s> What about it?
<s> How do you think I got here?
<s> Let's look anyway.
<s> I love you, Adam.
<s> Why? So you can kill me too? Tex is dead, I've seen him! He said Dyle did it!
<s> I'm through listening to you!
<s> Reggie -- listen to me --
<s> Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
<s> I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
<s> You mean spies and things like that?
<s> Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
<s> You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
<s> You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
<s> Describe him.
<s> No.
<s> Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
<s> Very good.
<s> Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you?
<s> Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
<s> -- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
<s> No.
<s> I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
<s> I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
<s> Okay -- up there.
<s> The view had better be worth it.
<s> I'll take that.
<s> But you know my name -- it's Dyle.
<s> It's not so bad. You may not be able to lie on your back for a few days -- but, then, you can lie from any position, can't you?
<s> Would you like to see my passport?
<s> Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
<s> There must be some way.
<s> Reggie -- listen to me --
<s> So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
<s> I think I love you, Alex --
<s> That sounds like their problem.
<s> I don't know -- it depends on whether or not they've already eaten.
<s> Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
<s> No.
<s> Maybe.
<s> What -- like Scobie?
<s> No --
<s> Let me know what you want -- I'll pick a suit that matches.
<s> I dare you.
<s> Carson Dyle didn't have a brother.
<s> But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua.
<s> Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
<s> I'm afraid it is important.
<s> In money.
<s> That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly.
<s> Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.
<s> The kid said --
<s> Tell me what?
<s> He didn't have one.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I know. I would bury it in the garden.
<s> A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
<s> Why, do you think we're going to?
<s> You give up awfully easy, don't you?
<s> Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
<s> Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
<s> It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
<s> Charles sold it all -- at auction.
<s> I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
<s> That's what I'm not supposed to say.
<s> How would you like a spanking?
<s> There are three men -- he's one of them -- they think I have something that belongs to them.
<s> A quarter of a million dollars.
<s> Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
<s> What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?
<s> Words can hurt very much.
<s> He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.
<s> Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
<s> I think I know how to restore your reputation.
<s> That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
<s> Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
<s> Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
<s> Daddy you scared me!
<s> What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME.
<s> Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
<s> Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?
<s> What's wrong?
<s> How much further?
<s> It can't be.
<s> No I wasn't.
<s> Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
<s> Run!
<s> A bullet to the right cerebellum.
<s> Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
<s> 
<s> You're not?
<s> No. Hell, it's the quietest goddamn party I've ever seen.
<s> You think you're my sister?
<s> OK. increase the peace.
<s> There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.
<s> The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could.
<s> You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
<s> So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
<s> I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.
<s> Jody, you're only doing this to get back at your dad. It doesn't have that much to do with me.
<s> This party is sick.
<s> Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny. Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore.
<s> Pretend we're just another couple.
<s> Yeah. Who is she?
<s> No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
<s> Who is she?
<s> Why not?
<s> The principal?
<s> Yes. He asked me to come over and talk to you.
<s> Hi Sandy.
<s> Maybe you better just drive me home.
<s> What?

<s> Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.
<s> ...and a shitload of ice.
<s> Hey, you're gonna piss me--  What the hell are you supposed to be...
<s> What the hell is with you, dog?  He's the one with the damn gun.
<s> I'm gonna stomp your a--
<s> You stole this truck.
<s> ...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?!  You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell...
<s> I didn't steal the truck! He owed it to me!  Anyway, the important thing is I'm not goin' through Missoula!

<s> Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.
<s> Look out.
<s> 
<s> Oh, oh!
<s> Hey, be cool.
<s> That was quick.
<s> To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.
<s> Listen, shithead!
<s> ...such is the price...of patriotism.
<s> I did what I could for you...
<s>  ...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in...
<s> You-You can't let him...

<s> If you're right, Lewis, this Mason is one hell of a pro.  He must have a service record and a paper trail some-...
<s> ...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar!  And let me tell you something else.  I didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
<s> ...I wish they would've let me say something...
<s> You look good, Richard.
<s> ...you were right, of course.  But after...
<s> And I certainly can't say it's pleasant.
<s> Or I may be wrong.  The breeze could be gusting south.  That'd be Billings...

<s> Where's Elvis?!
<s> 
<s> 
<s> 
<s> You know, I have yet to get a simple cup of coffee and a meal in this place, Darlene.
<s> Go.
<s> All right, let's move...
<s> It must've happened right after we left.
<s> Excellent.
<s> There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
<s> ...forcing him to strike.  And only then does our noble friend realize that the prey...can bite...

<s> Some people might.
<s> So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
<s> How much longer for the range and power projections?
<s> What?
<s> ...badge someday, then you can ask the questions.  Until then...

<s> You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.
<s> No. She's probably scared to death.
<s> Well, It was about five days ago. You were outside the Pig 'n Whistle and you had one hell of an argument.
<s> My daughter.
<s> That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
<s> Oh, my, yes.
<s> What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
<s> You bet your ass you don't. You can't even pay me off.
<s> Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
<s> Could you drive me somewhere?
<s> Thank you...
<s> No.
<s> No?
<s> Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
<s> What pictures?
<s> I heard it was an accident.
<s> You accusing me of extortion?
<s> Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
<s> Gee, thanks, Lou.
<s> Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
<s> Of course.
<s> Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?
<s> Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
<s> Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
<s> I have?
<s> But he wasn't killed.
<s> That your maiden name?
<s> No. I'm just a snoop.
<s> Yes. He never forgave him for it.
<s> They can't be.
<s> What were you doing there?
<s> Doing what?
<s> The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
<s> I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
<s> There's something black in the green part of your eye.
<s> That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
<s> What about?
<s> ...That's not what I meant.
<s> Sure.
<s> Where's the girl?
<s> Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. Why?
<s> Katherine.
<s> To Mexico...
<s> He's in the dark room.
<s> Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
<s> Ida Sessions.
<s> Oh, good.
<s> I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
<s> I cut myself shaving.
<s> What about the water?
<s> Yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
<s> Who?
<s> I'm afraid so.
<s> I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
<s> Yeah.
<s> He was expecting you?
<s> Yes. No.
<s> He owned it.
<s> All she needed for that was the phone book!
<s> I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the big boys that are making the payoffs.
<s> Of course I knew your father. He was tall, thin, pleasant, and had a moustache like mine. Always smiling. He looked like Clark Gable.
<s> For example, at this moment the film's out of focus. Go see.
<s> Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off with me now! Come here! I don't know where the fuck I have to go.  And the next time be careful how you talk. Not to take credit away from the Lord, but if I had created the world, in all modesty, certain things would have come out better. But unfortunately such was not the case.
<s> I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
<s> Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
<s> Elena. My name's Elena.
<s> Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
<s> Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend everything's normal. I'm Salvatore.
<s> I got back today. You can't imagine the excuses I had to make up to be here...
<s> The army says that, as a war orphan, I don't have to serve in the military, but nothing can be done. It's a bureaucratic error. I have to leave. Day after tomorrow morning. They're sending me to Rome. But they'll discharge me ten days later. Let's go...
<s> Don't be silly...I'm old.  Don't look at me like that, please.  Why'd you come back?
<s> Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.
<s> Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
<s> It takes years to get there. And years to come back...Now go to bed, Toto, it's late.
<s> No...
<s> No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
<s> Well, it's hard to call an important person by his first name. But if it really matters to you, I'11 call you...  Toto!...
<s> You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
<s> I promise not to bring any more Venuses and not to worry - and not to try to get in touch with any of the papers -
<s> Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
<s> Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
<s> You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
<s> Well, Mr. Bernstein, you were with Mr. Kane from the very beginning -
<s> Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
<s> Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 
<s> It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
<s> Yes.
<s> Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
<s> Hello, Bernstein.
<s> Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -
<s> Yes - Mr. Kane.
<s> It isn't finished?
<s> He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
<s> Thank you.  I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake.  The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle -  I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
<s> Please don't talk any more, Charles.
<s> Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
<s> It may not be about anything at all.
<s> I don't see what else you can do, Charles.  If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
<s> I'm not interested in the voters of this state right now.  I am interested in - well, Junior, for one thing.
<s> What's the matter with you?
<s> Thanks.
<s> I always like to see the funny side of things.  No sense crying when you don't have to.  And you're so funny.  Looking at you, I forget all about my toothache.
<s> On the chiffonier.  Here.
<s> I didn't say.
<s> I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
<s> You're in a tent, darling.  You're not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
<s> Susan!
<s> No, you're not.
<s> Don't go, Susan.
<s> Don't you worry about me.  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  I'm no cheap, crooked politician, trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes -
<s> If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit.  The newspapers, for instance.  I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco...  It's all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason.  Aren't you, maestro? 
<s> You're right.  We did lose a million dollars last year.
<s> Can't say, sir.
<s> Not my wife - not either of them.
<s> Persia.  It belonged to a king.
<s> But there is no Front, Charlie. There's a very doubtful civil war. Besides, I don't want the job.
<s> How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
<s> And I do it because they do it, and they do it - it's a vicious circle, isn't it?  I'm going over to Georgie's, Brad - you know, Georgie, don't you?
<s> It's simpler than that, Brad.  A society girl can't stand the gaff, that's all.  Other things are important to her - social position, what they're saying on the front porches at Southampton, is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner -
<s> Mr. Leland sent back that check.
<s> You made it out to him last week after he left for Chicago.
<s> It is.  Go on, Mr. Thatcher -
<s> Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
<s> Sure, Mr. Leland.  I'll be glad to.
<s> I wonder -  You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Millions - if anybody wants it.
<s> What did you get?
<s> The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
<s> I feel kind of sorry for him, all the same -
<s> Am I sure about what?
<s> What the hell is that?
<s> It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
<s> Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
<s> No, don't!
<s> Dante. You've got a customer.
<s> I can't believe you're here.
<s> Very dramatic, I thought.
<s> And you came here to what? To comfort me?
<s> What?
<s> There's more, isn't there?
<s> But can we date?
<s> I left like an hour ago.
<s> Was it you?
<s> I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
<s> Oh God...
<s> Nobody. It was closed.
<s> We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
<s> So I'm told.
<s> This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
<s> Oooh! Navy Seals!
<s> Bunch of savages in this town.
<s> Go open the sore.
<s> No, thanks.
<s> Why?
<s> Eight and a half?
<s> She called you Brad?
<s> Chess team Allan Harris?!
<s> This guy is going through all of the eggs. Look.
<s> Can we talk about this later?
<s> Let's hear it.
<s> Why not?
<s> You know what pisses me off the most?
<s> We're not playing in the street.
<s> Yeah, right.
<s> Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
<s> Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.
<s> One night only. She's buried in the morning.
<s> She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
<s> Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
<s> What, your dick?
<s> I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
<s> So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
<s> I don't want to talk to you.
<s> I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
<s> Not yet. 
<s> I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
<s> Living proof.
<s> I don't; you did.
<s> Little girl. Maybe five years old?
<s> I'm not.
<s> I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
<s> As if it's that easy.
<s> Leave her out of this.
<s> ...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
<s> Point is-I'm not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably.
<s> What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
<s> You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank?  You know what the real tragedy is? I'm not even supposed to be here today!
<s> I know I can bench more than that!
<s> What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
<s> I should start.
<s> With you? I don't think so.
<s> So.
<s> Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
<s> We were going to start again, I think.
<s> Meaning?
<s> I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
<s> So I'm told.
<s> Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
<s> Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
<s> Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.
<s> I'm not even supposed to be here today!
<s> Really?
<s> Including you?
<s> Including you; yes.
<s> I'm not the pig you are.
<s> After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.
<s> Please calm down.
<s> Let it go...
<s> Something like thirty-six.
<s> Lower your voice!
<s> I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective.
<s> And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!
<s> Randal...?
<s> Veronica, I love you...
<s> They oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes.
<s> A word of advice: Sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go.
<s> Swear.  Olaf, metal!
<s> Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
<s> I hope it feels good.
<s> How long you gonna be here?
<s> Yo. I'll see you at that party.  I'll see you there?
<s> You're not?
<s> He didn't ask me to...
<s> You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
<s> Bye. 
<s> That woulda been cool.
<s> Nothing, just tourist souvenirs.
<s> Hey, let's get something straight. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
<s> Fuck you.
<s> Hal will have my head for this.
<s> I admit, I can be bought.
<s> Bags?
<s> You do, and the spring thaw is going to be worth a lot of cash!
<s> Sarah, hold on, he'll have you in a second.  Jesus Christ, grab her!
<s> Look, I know--
<s> I did what I thought was right.
<s> Look, it was a bad time for everybody.
<s> And you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell.  Now drop it!
<s> Would you?
<s> Give him the money.
<s> That's it, you look like a professional.
<s> Patience my love, patience.
<s> Don't believe it...  You know the trouble with you is you have no brain filter. Everything you think just pours right out.
<s> On my way.  Alright Sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park?
<s> Working...I'm trying to figure out where to start.
<s> Flare up of old emotions...
<s> Hal knows what he's doing.
<s> What are you doing here!?
<s> Excuse me?
<s> You know me, I'm a night person.
<s> I'm glad you find humor in this.  Do you know what people would do for that?
<s> I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
<s> Jess, c'mon...
<s> We were going together before I ever let go of you.
<s> I don't know.  I don't know.
<s> Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
<s> Enough's enough.  How could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind.
<s> The only faster way up is the East Face and it's smooth as glass.  Maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather, only a psycho would try it in a storm.
<s> Half a day.
<s> Climb, Gabe, climb!
<s> On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.
<s> Let's move your ass in there!!
<s> Were.  Give me the tracking monitor!
<s> He can't be far away.  Find him. Go!
<s> I told you, 50,000 possible keycode combinations, in fifteen second intervals.
<s> Richard Travers.
<s> You're the boss.  Let's head out to the tarmac.  Matheson, have you been totally briefed?
<s> There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.
<s> Phoned some friends, sir?
<s> Help me, sir?
<s> Well, as I've said, we've heard about you. We are interested in your case. We want to help you.
<s> Well, shall we get down to it?
<s> Because next time it's going to be the barry place and all my work ruined. If you've no respect for your horrible self, you at least might have some for me who'se sweated over you. He slaps Alex on the knee.
<s> Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
<s> No, sir, I feel really great.
<s> Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
<s> We put him away where he can do you no harm. You see we are looking after your interests. We are interested in you, and when you leave here you will have no further worries. We shall see to everything... a good job on a good salary.
<s> One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.
<s> Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.
<s> Well, all this needs thinking about, son. I mean we can't very well just kick Joe out... Not just like that, can we? I mean Joe is here doing a job. A contract it is, two years. Well, we made like an arrangement, didn't we Joe? You see, son, Joe's paid next month's rent already so, well, whatever we do in the future, we cant just say to Joe to get out, now can we?
<s> You wanna be sick?
<s> And, O my brothers, would you believe your faithful friend and long suffering narrator pushed out his red yahzik a mile and a half to lick the grahzny, vonny boots. The horrible killing sickness had wooshed up and turned the like joy of battle into a feeling I was going to snuff it. Minister rises.
<s> Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
<s> C of E, sir.
<s> Crabs?
<s> Through there for a bath.
<s> Shut your bleedin' hole!!!
<s> How're you feeling this morning?
<s> We're going to friends now, sir.
<s> Yes!!!
<s> I haven't seen you before.
<s> I just say what the other person would say?
<s> I never forget a face! I never forget any face, be God!
<s> I take it you are referring to the Ludovico Technique?
<s> Are you now, or ever have been, a homosexual?
<s> Leave to carry on, sir, please?
<s> Sir.
<s> You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
<s> This is to make sure you stay cured. Georgie hits Alex in the stomach with his blackjack. Then, they push his head under the water and methodically start to beat him with their blackjacks. After a full minute of this, they drag him out, halt-drowned,
<s> We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
<s> Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
<s> Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
<s> I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
<s> I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
<s> Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
<s> ...Petrov and Cicerno for sure...
<s> No.  Your cabbie is floating down a storm drain or stuffed in the trunk of a cab.
<s> Elvis?
<s> Jesus.  Two in one night?
<s> Oh, call me Ida.  To what do we owe the pleasure?
<s> And you came all the way down here to see me?
<s> Max never had many friends.  So much with the piano.  Always keeping to himself, it's unhealthy...
<s> I've been calling and calling.
<s> You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
<s> What am I gonna do with flowers?
<s> Vincent.  It was nice to meet you. Visit again?
<s> I was just tryin' to...to...
<s> Jesus, what is with this guy?
<s> Yeah, yeah, sorry...
<s> An apology.
<s> You share it with over three million people every day.  You know that's the population of New Zealand?  What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  Read about this one guy.  Gets on the subway and dies.  Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that.  Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million.  That's too damn many people.
<s> You mean like benefits?
<s> Me, specifically?
<s> You always stutter?
<s> The trunk?
<s> The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
<s> Okay, try it now.
<s> They're <u>somebody's</u> friends...  You drive a cab.  I kill people.  We both do our jobs right, you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead.
<s> I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
<s> How?
<s> Why?
<s> I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
<s> Oh, I'm captivated.
<s> What happened?
<s> It's not bullshit.
<s> He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
<s> I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
<s> That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
<s> Some living.
<s> That's what you said...
<s> That's the reason?
<s> Then what are you?
<s> None of your business.
<s> Why the hell not?
<s> Sorry, Flip.  Got sidetracked.
<s> Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
<s> Them who?
<s> Yeah.  I think so.
<s> What is it with you and the space program?
<s> I have no idea.
<s> 'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'.  'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'.  Oliver Stone?
<s> Getting rid of my hub!
<s> Never, but I've been practicing.
<s> Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.
<s> Not this again.
<s> Fuck you.  I know you're crazy, but fuck you.
<s> They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
<s> Realized what?
<s> Nobody dies in Newport.  They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there.  Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport.
<s> What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.
<s> Don't do this to yourself.  Jerry. You don't love me.
<s> Now's not really the time to get into this --
<s> There's a car following us. Probably another one flanking us the next street over.
<s> That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why?
<s> Your father, he was dying.  He was worried about you.  He took your picture out to look at it.  He called you his baby.
<s> Where are you?
<s> It was my dog.  Let me ask you a question.  How long have you been acquainted with Jerry?
<s> I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
<s> Truth'll set you free.  I'm listening.
<s> I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
<s> Too bad.  Because I'm terrible at 'yes.'
<s> Then this is a goddamn emergency.
<s> -- Understood.
<s> Wait --
<s> Wasn't my idea.
<s> I'm not sure.  We have no launch protocol; the entry of the passenger is supposed to initiate activation.
<s> Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
<s> What?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
<s> Tell me.
<s> No doubt.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
<s> This... seemed best.
<s> How soon will you be able to decode it?
<s> Analyzing signal polarization shifts.
<s> Maybe it'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles.
<s> I don't know.  Maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere, but if there is, I sure as hell can't find it.
<s> Put it on speakers.
<s> Kent, Kent for Chrissakes.  You must be Eleanor.
<s> It's a civilian facility.
<s> You don't seem to understand that it's your interests I'm trying to protect -- !
<s> That's my scientist.
<s> We thought this might make things a little easier.
<s> Many others.
<s> In return... you get the primer -- and with it the power to stay in the game.  Do we have a deal?
<s> Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
<s> We've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction.  Do you call it 'interventionist' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck?
<s> Any luck on the grant money?
<s> Ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this?  I mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. You won't be publishing.  You won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all.
<s> Actually --
<s> 'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
<s> Peter.
<s> Wait -- hold on a minute --
<s> How long was I gone?
<s> I never knew my mother.  My father died when I was nine.
<s> Why?
<s> In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.
<s> It's late.  We should go back.
<s> I can't do this --
<s> Hi.
<s> Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
<s> Call it xenophobic paranoia.  Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this?  This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust --
<s> Y'know what?  Fine.  I guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are there's no quicker way to show them.
<s> Git movin', I said.
<s> Well, I don't know, I just wash my hands of it, I guess I just got to love you and let go.
<s> Gotta go, Arletta.
<s> Yeah. Come on out, Luke.
<s> I don't know, Boss.
<s> No, Boss! I won't. I won't. I got my mind right. I got it right, Boss. Please don't hit me no more.
<s> Yes sir, Boss Paul!
<s> I'll give you fifty cents.
<s> I got eyes, don't I? How my not gonna see something like that?
<s> Pair'a nines.
<s> That'sa Lucille, you mullet head! Any girl so innocent and built like that gotta be named Lucille.
<s> That's what you're gonna have to do.
<s> Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.
<s> Like an elephant.
<s> On my own.
<s> Maybe we oughta call you No-Ears. You don't listen much, do you, boy?
<s> You jus' may be great at hangin' paper around the big cities, but us country boys is not entirely brainless. When it comes to the law, nothin' is understood.
<s> No more than five. For a cold drink.
<s> Gettin' up, Carr.
<s> Call.
<s> All the bears gonna be walking today.
<s> That is one mean lady. Bet her husband spends one day a week shooting milkmen.
<s> Only kidding!
<s> Well!  Aren't we the daring one? What's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make Doctor Helen set foot outside her door?  The antenna is gone off her car again.  I had no music, all the way to the market.  Let me find a garage for it?
<s> About what?
<s> You've got a date right <u>here</u>, Andy. This has got to...
<s> You talked to me.  Do you remember?
<s> Tell her about <u>what</u>?
<s> What pattern was that?
<s> Inspector Halloran.  Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
<s> I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
<s> The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...
<s> I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
<s> That Klutz.  They send him back here, I'll kick his ass good.
<s> Who was the man in the basement?
<s> No.  Not yet.
<s> You're calling me a crank?
<s> Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
<s> Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the Festival of Love?  You make any sense in that?
<s> That's no surprise.
<s> Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
<s> Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
<s> Ruben's dead.   So stupid, a cop thing, a crazy kid and a buncha dumb mistakes... I'm sorry... because you and he...
<s> What does it matter?  This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up?
<s> They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
<s> You called us, Doctor, if you don't want to look at them here, how about downtown.  I'll drive you down...
<s> He's hacked into her Internet address.  He's a hacker.
<s> MaryJane.  We call her M.J.
<s> Not yet.
<s> Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe. I'll fix it...
<s> <u>What</u>?...
<s> They taught me at the FBI.  I was very good at it.  It scared me... I liked it.
<s> What else?
<s> Over here.
<s> Because it's your job, that's all.
<s> Doped up kids all over town.  Park was full of them last night.  Very easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.
<s> He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
<s> Look at him, grandstanding...
<s> Bunch of Swedish women.  You're too young.
<s> Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
<s> Good.
<s> That's always your privilege, sir.
<s> ...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern?  Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
<s> She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
<s> I'll listen for you buzzing over.
<s> My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
<s> One of your suitors?
<s> James.
<s> Haven't I? To the airport, if you could.
<s> I work in the immigration department there.
<s> Are you still involving me in your crash?
<s> Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.
<s> Yes.
<s> I live in my car. This is my workshop.
<s> Where are you?
<s> Drugs can help suppress symptoms. But lots of patients stop taking them when they're on their own because the side effects are so harsh.  And, Michael's condition is often worsened by periods of stress. He's been in and out of...
<s> But everything's OK?
<s> You look beautiful.
<s> No, no. They've got to be Puglia olives, packed in a light brine with a flavor that doesn't overpower the palate.
<s> Ecru.
<s> That's thanks to all your help.
<s> You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
<s> Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
<s> Wow.   Congratulations.
<s> No, not yet. But you know Paul. He's sure to get it.
<s> Especially with a promotion in the offing.
<s> Can I get you a glass of champagne?
<s> I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
<s> Mom, please.
<s> It's good exercise, Mom.
<s> Not even if it's something positive?
<s> I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's?
<s> Sometimes my food, and my clothes, and my underwear.
<s> It's magic.
<s> I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
<s> But I do.     I love you, too.
<s> Home free.
<s> I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?
<s> Aren't you ever quiet?
<s> You like it?
<s> Out? Are you kidding?     I've got all the fixings here.
<s> Shhhh.
<s> I'll see you tonight.
<s> You got wine. That's great.
<s> Are you OK?
<s> I saw you talking to my Mom.
<s> I guess so.
<s> How about something better?   Like a kiss.
<s> You should go.
<s> I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
<s> No, it's not like that.
<s> I'm going to the store.
<s> Especially this last year.
<s> It's, it's really nice, Paul.
<s> No.
<s> I heard about your friend.
<s> I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children.  Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on...
<s> That's so sweet, Michael. But, really, I've so many things to do.
<s> I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
<s> I thought you wanted Zammito?
<s> Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
<s> I guess we're going to find out.
<s> Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket?
<s> I'm just setting my boundaries.
<s> We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
<s> You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
<s> He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
<s> If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
<s> Man, I can get anything.
<s> Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
<s> How much?
<s> Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.
<s> Everything?
<s> Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
<s> Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
<s> Oh, then we will have the house wine.
<s> Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.
<s> Okay.   You can be Elvis.
<s> And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
<s> Yeah, I dig him.
<s> Cool.
<s> Wait here.
<s> And you don't speak French?
<s> It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
<s> It's not your fault.
<s> She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
<s> A little?
<s> How's the arm?  Still sore?
<s> Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
<s> Let's go!
<s> Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring.
<s> You're too young to understand.
<s> Really?
<s> Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
<s> Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead. Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go ahead.
<s> Kneel!
<s> All right.  Hurry.  I will hold on as long as I can.
<s> My comb!
<s> Give me back my comb.
<s> Yes.
<s> Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?
<s> Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.
<s> It's time for me to leave it behind.
<s> Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
<s> But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.
<s> My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
<s> I knew she would intrigue you.
<s> All right.  I'll write you an introduction.  Take it to Wudan. Wait there for news from me.
<s> Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?
<s> That can't be!  Everything has an antithesis!  Why not this?
<s> Shu Lien...
<s> A murderer?
<s> A female criminal!  Now that's news!
<s> We must avenge mother!
<s> Father!  Let me avenge my mother's death.
<s> This is a delicate matter.
<s> You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?
<s> No onions?
<s> Annie, I need a file.
<s> This is special, darlin'.  Please?
<s> No further.  I'm serious.
<s> You must listen carefully:  the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.  As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.
<s> Fucking A, my friend.
<s> I should be trying to stop you.
<s> My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these.
<s> I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
<s> Who?
<s> A remembrance.  A closure.
<s> You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww.
<s> Murderer.
<s> I don't know you...
<s> Leave me alone -- !
<s> Go away.
<s> I'm already alone.
<s> Very well, it's your ass.
<s> Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,
<s> Is he inside?
<s> One of mine.  And it wasn't a standard hit.
<s> "Our" Crow...?
<s> I'll be fine.
<s> Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
<s> You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
<s> Junior.
<s> No.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Give me the fucking letter.
<s> Refreshing.
<s> Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
<s> Without question.
<s> It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
<s> No.
<s> That's not fair.
<s> Hi.
<s> Sure.
<s> You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
<s> What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
<s> Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
<s> Doesn't ring a bell.
<s> Greg McConnell.
<s> Don't you raise your voice at me. Go to your room, now.
<s> Okay.
<s> I do like him. I can't stop thinking about him.
<s> Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room.
<s> Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes don't do you justice. Why don't you take them off.
<s> I'm taking a shower.
<s> Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
<s> Really? Care to make a wager on that?
<s> Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
<s> Get out of here.
<s> And you think she bought it?
<s> Who is this?
<s> But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address.
<s> It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
<s> Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
<s> What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
<s> What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience.
<s> Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day."  I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out?
<s> Take a look for yourself.
<s> Where is she?
<s> What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?
<s> Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
<s> You wanted an answer to your question.
<s> Thank you. Now, where were we?
<s> Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette.
<s> And if I don't?
<s> It's Cecile.
<s> You will be discreet about this?
<s> Nope.
<s> I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
<s> I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
<s> But it's already come true.
<s> Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
<s> But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
<s> I'm not shouting at you, but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child!
<s> What?
<s> I'm sorry. I was somewhere else. He returns to the card game.
<s> Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
<s> I'll show you.
<s> Yes, Amy?
<s> I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
<s> But we don't have any sea weed.
<s> Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
<s> It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
<s> Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
<s> I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
<s> No, thank you.
<s> Then I'll tell you a story — a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
<s> Good.
<s> Don't you read Shakespeare?
<s> I'll not see her, Barbara. I promise.
<s> We'll see that she gets there in good time
<s> What's with her? If they're not bleeding they're PMSing. If they're not PMSing, they're warning you about the impending doom. If you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life.
<s> Jennifer gave her a make-over.
<s> Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.
<s> Yeah but they looked cool...
<s> What does that have to do with me?
<s> No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
<s> Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
<s> Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
<s> Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.
<s> And my bra finally fits again.
<s> Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
<s> Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
<s> Okay. I guess so.
<s> It is so hot in here.
<s> No you don't, believe me.
<s> It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head!
<s> I haven't gotten it yet.
<s> Frida, Carlton's dead.
<s> You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
<s> I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
<s> Hide him.
<s> I guess you'll find out.
<s> Hey, how about a little nightcap?
<s> I really gotta pee.
<s> I didn't have to pee then.
<s> Since when do you care?
<s> Yeah right... You better go.
<s> We... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. Um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it.
<s> Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
<s> That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
<s> So what book did you buy?
<s> Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
<s> Briefs.
<s> Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
<s> A man killed in Central Park.
<s> What? Is there someone else?
<s> Let's explore this. What makes you feel you're a werewolf?
<s> Oh my god, what happened?
<s> Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
<s> She's just so... pathetic.
<s> She'll talk about PMS and stare at her salad.
<s> She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
<s> And he was missing an arm.
<s> Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
<s> She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
<s> Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
<s> What makes her think that?
<s> Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
<s> Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard?
<s> Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
<s> How will we interrogate them?
<s> I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
<s> What makes you think that!  If you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked  -  you might get things done faster, Bumstead...
<s> This ocean business...  I know where I can find a map.  I need to go back to the station.  Where will you be?
<s> I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
<s> What?  Who has?
<s> A few days...  a few weeks  -  dunno, I can't remember.  Worse thing is, I never know if it will change back again...  Now, please leave me alone.
<s> Then we must call the police.
<s> Shut up!
<s> I'm nothing then.
<s> Of course you are.  You couldn't do those terrible things.  Come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
<s> We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
<s> A month.
<s> No...
<s> Great.
<s> ... What?
<s> Bob...
<s> It's simple, Alan.  We send the Vice- President to Africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our `President' to nominate a new one.  The whole thing takes a few weeks tops.
<s> Is that everybody?
<s> No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.
<s> I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
<s> Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
<s> Dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
<s> I heard you.  You said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.'
<s> Don't do this.
<s> I was gonna do something with Joan.
<s> It's fine.
<s> Choices?
<s> You could buy it on payments.
<s> That'd be great.
<s> What?
<s> But we went there.  We saw those kids.
<s> Oh, I know, I know... It looks awfully bad.  It's really embarrassing.  But it was Bob's idea.
<s> She knows.
<s> I can't say.
<s> Of course.
<s> The Vice-President...
<s> Well...
<s> Thanks, Duane.
<s> Yeah.  I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
<s> There's no mistake, Bill.   If you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake.
<s> I saw the light.  I thought maybe you were up.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.
<s> Oh... Okay.
<s> He wasn't always like that, anyway.
<s> You mean when I'm not running the country?
<s> I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
<s> It's nice.
<s> I know.
<s> Dammit...  I told them no mayo.  See - - I could veto this Simpson Garner thing, but I really don't want to do that...
<s> Uh, yes, sir.  The Monroe Hotel...
<s> To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
<s> I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab.
<s> gonna change, young lady. Now if you still got a statement you'd like ta make, you can jus' hold onto it 'til tonight.
<s> It's not a very big army. And small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on...
<s> I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.
<s> We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five.
<s> It's...he was...one who came to the island with me.
<s> He's my contact for Chrissake! There's two crates. Can you get me into the hospital?
<s> I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
<s> I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha ha...
<s> And you're the one who builds the bomb and they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be used'.
<s> Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.
<s> So don't goddam come!  Please.
<s> Well, no shit, Sherlock
<s> What is the Dead Poets Society?
<s> Hey, this is great.
<s> Needs Chris!  Must have Chris!
<s> Knox, you gotta calm down.
<s> I couldn't stop myself.
<s> Miss it?  It drives us crazy.  That's part of what this club is about.  In fact, I'd like to announce that I've published an article in the school paper, in the name of the Dead Poets society, demanding girls be admitted to Welton, so we can all stop beating off.
<s> I think you're sweet.
<s> But...
<s> No one, sir.  It was just me.  I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
<s> That's not my fault.
<s> I'm supposed to turn everybody in, apologize to the school and all will be forgiven.
<s> Are you kidding?  Don't be ridiculous.
<s> It's not all right.  Come on, Dad
<s> It does?  What?
<s> You are?  She's glad I called!
<s> All I'm asking you to do is listen.  "The heavens made a girl named Chris, With hair and skin of gold To touch her would be paradise To kiss her glory untold."
<s> You say that over and over but you don't even know me!
<s> And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
<s> Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
<s> What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
<s> That goes for all of you.  Now eat with your correct hands.
<s> I didn't know you taught.
<s> I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
<s> I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
<s> Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
<s> Isn't there an easier way?
<s> Listen, anything's, better than mystery meat.
<s> My brother went here.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it.
<s> So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
<s> Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
<s> No!  I don't know,  I'll probably never know.  The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine.  All right?
<s> It's my birthday.
<s> They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
<s> I'll come to the performance.
<s> YEA, ART THOU THERE?!
<s> He's the owner...
<s> All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves.
<s> I don't know what these things are ...all I know is...
<s> I know it...but you want to get where you want to get, and back? I need a chief engineer, and unless you got a replacement, I'd highly recommend overlooking the indescretion.
<s> I have a schedule...
<s> I told you...
<s> It ain't any better out there!
<s> Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
<s> That's what I do.
<s> Hey! I didn't have to come back.
<s> Keep tasting...
<s> Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
<s> Why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here?
<s> I saw these guy perform...at Altmont ...you know that? They opened for the Stones...
<s> What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
<s> Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
<s> And you got 10 minutes before this thing livens up a boring evening.
<s> One whistle... Start the engine...
<s> Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...
<s> Nowhere...
<s> You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too?
<s> Fuckin' A!
<s> We're all going.
<s> What do you think, Sal? Jesus, you think we'd miss this?
<s> I'll get it! Where is it?
<s> You're full of shit!
<s> They did not!
<s> So he's in the next one, Albert. I mean take it easy. I mean you're driving everybody nuts!
<s> She does not!
<s> You mean...?
<s> Yeah.
<s> You talk to him?
<s> What hospital is he in? Where?
<s> But I insist.
<s> I came to see Merle.
<s> Inside, Vince.
<s> Here.
<s> Biederman, yes.
<s> Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.
<s> Fine. I'm fine. How are you?
<s> I... No. You do this for money?
<s> I want to go home, Merle.
<s> This is horrible!
<s> There's Vince!
<s> Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo?
<s> You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
<s> From Nam?
<s> Merle --
<s> What do you think?
<s> How much? How much do you wanna bet?
<s> Nick. Hey. How's things?
<s> Place is great. Really. One great place... Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I'll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you'd rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder's neat, I mean --
<s> Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
<s> Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
<s> Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
<s> Naw.  Uh-huh.
<s> Sure.
<s> In the timeless words of Squire Albert...
<s> I just... would like to say a few words... about Merle. I guess Merle always wanted something... I don't know... better. That fucking guy, he saved my Life. He saved Sal's... What Merle liked, he liked things right... But then there wasn't any place for that... that he could find.
<s> Down.
<s> What'cha got, Bennett?
<s> Technothugs?
<s> He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
<s> I've been alone for twenty years. I don't feel very sociable.
<s> You stole the heroin out of the evidence room and planted it on me.  I was iced.  What better way to keep me from talking.  Stop me if I'm wrong.
<s> I was part of the escort team that re-animated him.  My partner's dead because of this guy.
<s> He could be brought back.
<s> We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
<s> How do I look?
<s> Pass.
<s> Relax, let technology do the work.
<s> You don't follow the bodies, and you don't follow procedure.  You do it by instinct.  Think like him.  Do what has to be dane.
<s> I was set up.
<s> I'll be okay.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
<s> What else did he get?
<s> Hospital food.
<s> I'm signing off.
<s> This is the guy that killed my partner.
<s> He went dirty and they made an example of him.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What's your name?
<s> Good to know you, Willy.
<s> From over the mountain --
<s> Thank you, Belle --
<s> Young man -- you got me there.
<s> You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.
<s> All right, darling.
<s> That's just too bad --
<s> I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
<s> Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
<s> But what becomes of our souls?
<s> Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
<s> About what?
<s> Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.
<s> Ten throws it is.
<s> Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
<s> There's no joy in it for me.
<s> Well, I --
<s> Breakfast ... Ah! ... Come along friends, Ma Stone's a cook this side of heaven.
<s> Morning, Jabez.
<s> Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret?
<s> Who is it?
<s> Do you think I'm grudging it?
<s> It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
<s> You're right, Mary it's a fine calf. That's why Stevens'll take it for the rest of the payment.
<s> Jabez!
<s> Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
<s> Tired?
<s> There is nothing to worry about now.
<s> Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
<s> I'll get it, Jabez.
<s> I'll never get my washing done.
<s> I wasn't used to being big -- wasn't used to thinking in big ways. Now, I've made up my mind.
<s> Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.
<s> Isn't that your own fault?
<s> It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
<s> Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?
<s> Consarn the consarn --
<s> Not on the Sabbath you won't, Jabez!
<s> That's a word you're too free with lately, Jabez, consarn this and consarn that ...
<s> My son! Do you really think, Ma....
<s> Wouldn't profit him none.
<s> Make out? We'll do better than that!  I never thought I'd be glad for bad luck, but I am. I never thought I'd be glad of a hail storm at harvest time, but I am! Oh, bless ye the works of the Lord in the hail and the storm and the rain!
<s> You'll be a father any minute now.
<s> It's all right, Sheriff.
<s> Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
<s> Yes, Mrs. Slossum told me -- Lucy can't even keep a secret -- Selectman -- my son -- well, who would have thought of that?
<s> The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
<s> Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
<s> Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
<s> If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
<s> Why, you long-barreled, slab-sided, lantern- jawed, note-shaving crook, be off with you ...
<s> Married.
<s> But meant her moving here.
<s> So, why didn't you come?
<s> Mind if I play some tunes?
<s> I'll find someplace.
<s> Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge here.
<s> We must shut down the building.  Go wider --!
<s> Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening. They want something.  Now, personally, I don't care about your politics. Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's none of my business.  I figure, You're here to negotiate, am I right?
<s> It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!
<s> I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
<s> Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt you.  Who are you?  What are you looking for?
<s> They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?
<s> One weekend I went to a combat ranch...  You know, that game with the, the guns that shoot red paint?  Must sound pretty silly to you...
<s> Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?
<s> Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
<s> Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
<s> I've spent half my life on airplanes,			* I can recognize someone who just got off one.  I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have ...something to do with this company.
<s> Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
<s> I'm here, cowboy.
<s> I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
<s> -- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!
<s> Yessir.
<s> Okay.
<s> Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!
<s> It's okay... it's okay...
<s> Yeah, well I don't blame him.
<s> I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you.
<s> You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
<s> You're crazy.
<s> He ain't going out.  And if I go out he's just gonna kill the people. There's a lot of lives that I'm responsible for... that's all.  So, I can't do anything.  I got myself into this mess and I'll get myself out of it... the best way I know how!  One of the ways is not giving up.  I'm telling ya!
<s> That's good then.  You've found something.
<s> Yeah... I'll write a song.  Ha, ha. I don't know.  Life is funny!
<s> Oh, God, they shot me with like unreal!
<s> He was under great strain: you don't understand, he's a very mixed up person.
<s> It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.  So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!'  So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.
<s> I can't talk to him.
<s> I'm not alone.
<s> What do you want to know that for?
<s> Call me Sonny-boy.
<s> I frisk you?
<s> So -- you want me to send one out there ... Okay.  I'll see what I can do.
<s> Come on.  I want you to see something.
<s> It's okay, you got a lot of protection.
<s> Sonny, your wife's on the way ... We reached her ... your wife's on the way ... everything you asked for, you got.
<s> Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
<s> Come on, lemme load you up...
<s> Gimme the keys to get outta here!
<s> Give me the keys...
<s> You're goin' outside with me.  If there's no cops around, we just split.  Otherwise, you go with us.
<s> They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning.  I don't know what they learn, Sonny.
<s> If you take anybody, please take me.
<s> I don't fool around with you.
<s> Would I hire you?
<s> Yeah?
<s> What now, Sonny?
<s> Yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out.
<s> No, that's all.
<s> You stopped?  Why?
<s> Fuck him - let him out!
<s> I want him to think that.
<s> Dead or alive?
<s> They gotta stop sayin' that.
<s> I want them all.
<s> What I said.  You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal.
<s> Who the hell is that?  God damn it! What the...
<s> Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
<s> Okay, newsman.  How much you make a week?  You're not talkin'.  You payin' me? What have you got for me?  We're givin' you entertainment ... what are you givin' us?
<s> Yesterday I received an e-mail from a source. In this e-mail were four social security numbers linked to the gentlemen who presented counterfeit California driver's licenses to my company late last night.
<s> How much?
<s> <i>Are you all right?</i>
<s> <i>I once vowed never to invest too much emotion into anyone, anything.</i>
<s> <i>Mr. Cigliuti?</i>
<s> <i>The system hasn't been updated.</i>
<s> <i>What happened to them?</i>
<s> <i>Remove... ... the... right arm.</i>
<s> What?
<s> <i>The money exchange will take place at Top of the World at the Stratosphere. Get there at exactly midnight.</i>
<s> I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is.
<s> <i>Her car was in the shop.</i>
<s> Yeah. <b> INT. FENDER HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER </b>
<s> Be kind to your sitter.
<s> Must you use that awful word?
<s> Yeah?! Well... I loved her too.
<s> You have sixty seconds... here's the question...  Which one of you is Frances?
<s> There are no bond certificates.
<s> Then so be it. If you believe what that Indian said we were fucked either way.
<s> Okay.  Domino Harvey is here.
<s> Real fast.
<s> He makes all his money off us Black people and I don't see nuthin' but Italians all up in there, Sylvester Stallone and motherfuckers.  Ya see what I'm saying, homeboy?
<s> You the man.
<s> Don't worry about it.  But when it happens and I'm in my boat and ya black ass is drowning, don't ask me to throw you a lifesaver either.
<s> No!
<s> I didn't.
<s> We're still standing.
<s> How old are you?
<s> I'm in here.
<s> Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid.
<s> Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
<s> I got nowhere to go.  We haven't had a good sit-down for a long while.
<s> I'm not studying no Mayor.  Besides, he reminds me of my least favorite peoples.  My tenants and my ex- husband--Goddamn-bless his soul.
<s> Whew!
<s> Look at those Korean motherfuckers across the street.  I betcha they haven't been a year off da motherfucking boat before they opened up their own place.
<s> Nobody talkin' 'bout ya moms.
<s> I didn't say nuthin'.  You must have a guilty conscience.  What are you guilty of?
<s> Motherfuck a window, Radio Raheem is dead.
<s> Come in then.
<s> How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
<s> Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love.
<s> Tina, I'll be right back.
<s> I am a man.
<s> Hello, Sal.  Hello, Vito.
<s> Magic Johnson.
<s> Eddie Murphy.
<s> Sounds funny to me.  As much as you say nigger this and nigger that, all your favorite people are "niggers."
<s> Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?
<s> If you don't make a stand, he's gonna be beating ya like a egg for the rest of your life.
<s> We're outta here.
<s> He's nuts.
<s> I ain't getting shit.
<s> I know.
<s> Vito, get a broom and sweep out front.
<s> Mister Radio Raheem, I can't even hear myself think.  You are disturbing me and you are disturbing my customers.
<s> Pop, what else can I say?  I don't wanna be here, they don't want us here.  We should stay in our own neighborhood, stay in Bensonhurst.
<s> Whaddup?
<s> Don't start on me today.
<s> Guys. Give me the two fifty and go away.
<s> Actually we have something for you.
<s> ... flying gracefully... over the rice fields.
<s> HARRY Dunne.
<s> Yes, you and the whole Special Needs class.
<s> A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
<s> Yeah. Look at this polar bear. It hasn't moved in half an hour. And those Eskimos over there...I'm sure at least one of them is a mannequin.
<s> We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
<s> Yeah...
<s> Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
<s> She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
<s> Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
<s> I, uh... changed for dinner. I get dressed for all my meals. Except breakfast and bath-meal.  Boy, it's hot in here. Mind if I open a window?
<s> Okay, what?
<s> It could be anything. You're going to discover a whole new world when you get to school.
<s> That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
<s> Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.
<s> Probably because we've never met.
<s> It'll be like taking candy from a stranger.
<s> You're not my real dad.
<s> They can't be real.
<s> Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
<s> HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!
<s> Yeah, but we still haven't found any treasure.
<s> Our own special bus.
<s> Some what?
<s> Shut up!
<s> You have beautiful eyes.
<s> A blimp.
<s> He must be on his way to pee out a fire.
<s> But I ate your Mom's pie.
<s> That's because Captain Rob is not a pirate. We've been through this.
<s> Yes. Screw George Washington. Just like Marilyn Monroe did.
<s> Roger that, Wilco.
<s> I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
<s> Oh, you're good.
<s> I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> Not to expect you tonight.
<s> I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> That's not your tape.
<s> If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late.
<s> This school's never had one before. I'd like to talk to you and all your special friends.
<s> You know, "some". The fag stuff.
<s> "My dream date with Principal Collins."
<s> I don't know if you'd call us "friends"...
<s> Uh-oh. Harry?
<s> Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
<s> Yes you are. 
<s> How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
<s> Aloha means hello and goodbye.
<s> I think you'll make a good teacher.
<s> The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
<s> JESSICA. Are you sure?
<s> Love it!
<s> The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
<s> Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
<s> My Lord?
<s> You carry my unborn sister in your womb!
<s> The most lethal poison in the Universe.
<s> Not all of them... I know which ones will.
<s> I have heard of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried...

<s> Don't you bave a car?
<s> I have no next picture.
<s> I think she's a honey.  Look at those jugs.
<s> Do you want me to get it for you?
<s> Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
<s> Ah, so I pull the strings!
<s> I am always on time.
<s> So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!
<s> Nah.  This happens all the time...
<s> Mmph?  Where am I?
<s> I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
<s> Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
<s> I'm obsolete.  I have nothing to live for.  Tonight, I should die.  And you should come with me.
<s> Isn't it wonderful?  After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
<s> Fine.  Let them!  There is no such thing as bad press.  A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!  First celebrity to ever check into rehab.  When I get out of here, I will be healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed for my comeback!
<s> Soon, Bela... Soon.
<s> Uh... you're a very important and respected man.  You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.
<s> Yeah, she's really somethin'.
<s> And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married --
<s> Rolling.
<s> These shoes are itchy.
<s> And who may you be?
<s> I made it up.  It's horseshit!
<s> I told you, the octopus is made of rubber.  This is a piece o' cake.
<s> You got the job?!!
<s> Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
<s> Toss us out on our ass.
<s> I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
<s> Like <u>what</u>?!
<s> I told you this was gonna happen.
<s> What other sixty-thousand?
<s> Sure thing, Mr. Kravitz.
<s> Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
<s> Hruphh...?
<s> Just, it doesn't look like very much.
<s> Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
<s> Don't worry.  You just haven't met right woman yet.  Oopsy.  That cabbage goes right through me.
<s> We're escaping!
<s> Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
<s> So you're not a fruit?
<s> So change the poster.  Trust me, you'll be better off.  This is a story that's gonna <u>grab</u> people.  It's about this guy.  He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses.  Should he tell her? Should he not tell her?  He's torn. George, this is DRAMA.
<s> Gee, I used every frame of film we shot.  Maybe they won't notice.
<s> You can't talk that way about my movie.
<s> Booties for my father.  He gets cold in this hospital.
<s> I am.  How's your father?
<s> No.  I'm from back east.  You know, All-American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office...
<s> Thanks.  It's actually the only thing I know how to make.  Hey, can you grab that strainer?
<s> Dynamite --
<s> It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
<s> You don't wanna be noticed?
<s> Yes!
<s> What octopus motor?
<s> So how long have you known Eddie?
<s> Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
<s> Are you IN5ANE?  <u>I'm</u> the director! <u>I</u> make the casting decisions around here!
<s> I'm directing.
<s> And you're gonna make a bundle.  This movie's gonna be famous!  But only if you SHUT UP, and let me do it my way!
<s> Isn't that the same thing?
<s> No! Do they show you having sex?
<s> Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her.
<s> I'm moving out.
<s> Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
<s> I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
<s> And all the kids stared calling me "Pumpkin Ass." "Hey Pumpkin Ass," -- for like a year. So, now, I feel like everyone's watching me and, you know, I'm "Pumpkin Ass" again.
<s> We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!
<s> This guy.
<s> Cynthia, I think you're laboring under a misconception. You seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. We're not. Anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. I want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. Remember this was your baby.
<s> Yes?
<s> I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
<s> When? Today?
<s> Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you.
<s> I'm not! I'm just trying to get some facts.
<s> So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.
<s> He says --
<s> He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al.  This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone.
<s> I'm coming right over. I'll be right there.
<s> Ma...
<s> No.
<s> They're gonna mock our foibles.
<s> It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.
<s> Never would be plenty.
<s> Who's in it?
<s> I hear the dog really liked him.
<s> Really? You see, to me, you shouldn't have any trouble with men. There should be, like, a line behind you.
<s> Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.
<s> You should see the one we wear when it rains.
<s> That's lucky.
<s> Why?
<s> I really like you too...
<s> Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
<s> What?
<s> It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
<s> What is?!
<s> That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
<s> In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
<s> All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
<s> Yeah?!
<s> Oh, Jesus.
<s> Please!
<s> A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.
<s> I love you! 1 want to marry you!
<s> Ed... I'm sorry.
<s> Hi.
<s> Sure.
<s> Ed?
<s> For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
<s> He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him.
<s> Yeah, uh, just a minute
<s> You have the key, Mr. McAllister.
<s> I know.
<s> I thought you were supposed to keep them.
<s> Should be easy.  So far no competition.
<s> Good luck, Tracy.
<s> Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
<s> As far as I know, they--
<s> Looks like Tim Kobza.
<s> If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
<s> That's enough, Tracy.  Quit while you're ahead, okay?  I'll handle this.  Could you ask Walt to come in?
<s> That said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done.  We'll begin with president.
<s> Hello, Tracy.
<s> My mother's buying me a new car for college.
<s> Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Would you sign it for me?
<s> Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
<s> Oh yeah, you bet.
<s> Uh, Jim?
<s> Just wait outside. Tammy.
<s> I have proof.
<s> Should we get a what?
<s> Sherry... I love you.
<s> Me?  I took advantage of you?  You hugged me!  You kissed me!  You're the one who --
<s> I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every vote was accounted for.
<s> I told you ... I can't. I just -- It doesn't feel right anymore, you know?
<s> So?
<s> Sorry.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Paul, get out!
<s> Yeah.  Oh, one more thing. Tammy. You know, all this election stuff. 'Cause, you know, everyone is saying it's so weird that you're running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you haven't really told me why you're doing it and didn't tell me in advance or anything.  But that's okay, you know.  l respect your privacy.  I just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it's you or me, there's no hard feelings. We're still brother and sister.  Okay? Cause... and I hope you feel the same.
<s> You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch jacket?
<s> Are you sorry she's dead?
<s> You fuck for money.
<s> He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
<s> Come in out of the rain.  In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
<s> No.  Now.  You fucked him.
<s> And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
<s> You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you?
<s> Stens?  Was it Stens?
<s> You said a neighbor heard a ruckus.  Was it outside, inside?
<s> It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  <u>Justice</u>.
<s> <u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
<s> The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
<s> Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.
<s> At least not anymore.
<s> Me?  You called it.  I got a message that...
<s> I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
<s> He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. <u>Whatever you desire</u>.
<s> Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
<s> Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.
<s> I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
<s> It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
<s> Until he gunned down six people.
<s> Man, why do you keep asking me that?
<s> Believed what?
<s> Dogs got no reason to live.
<s> Say what?
<s> I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.
<s> They shot him in his library.
<s> Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
<s> It's mine.  I'll make you my second in command.
<s> Anonymous.  Probably nothing.
<s> Two minutes, Dudley.  It's important.
<s> That's right.
<s> <u>Shit</u>.  Someone beat us here.
<s> I want you to follow Bud White.
<s> Why's she seeing Bud White?
<s> Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
<s> The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
<s> Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask a few questions.
<s> Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine.
<s> Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
<s> Jackie, all I know is what you know.  The man is very rich.  And he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer.  But that's it. Patchett's what I like to call 'Twilight.'  He ain't queer, he ain't Red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo.
<s> What's wrong, Trash?
<s> Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field.  My name doesn't matter.
<s> Listen--
<s> Why?
<s> Except for the part about my setting up a company in Zurich and knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the Gambino family.
<s> Rachel Banks?
<s> Really?
<s> Who was that other guy?
<s> Who are they?
<s> And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
<s> I called my wife!
<s> Oh, I'll bet <u>that</u> threw 'em off the scent. I sure hope you covered the mouthpiece with a handkerchief and used a funny voice!
<s> You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
<s> How'd you get around the tap orders?
<s> It really is.  Did you find anything?
<s> Who?
<s> No he won't.
<s> What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
<s> I'll say.
<s> Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
<s> The robbery.
<s> No.
<s> To buy lingerie.
<s> <u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
<s> This guy's a fat-assed Rotarian gasbag.
<s> Right.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> No.
<s> I went to the grocery store. My ATM and credit cards didn't work. I couldn't buy food.
<s> I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
<s> Stacy--
<s> Yeah.
<s> It's over.
<s> I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
<s> Who's doing this?
<s> You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
<s> Bullshit.
<s> You have to.
<s> It's not me?
<s> I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security.
<s> We'd rather not--
<s> Shut the fuck up.
<s> Seat 74.
<s> I got a call this morning from a source I trust. The Post is running a lead this afternoon about your involvement in the Bellmoth investigation.
<s> This is <u>bullshit</u>. Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.
<s> Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I don't know.
<s> Fuck off.
<s> Did you take <u>anything</u>--anything at all--out of those Christmas bags I brought home last week.
<s> Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
<s> Bobby--
<s> Bobby--
<s> Are you still in Crystal City?
<s> Jesus! I just told you. I don't know.
<s> Zavitz had digital compression equipment. He could've downloaded into something. A disk, a chip, anything small enough to put in his pocket and run with. Whatever he put it in, he dropped it in that bag.
<s> What the hell does it mean?
<s> Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney.  Mr. Reynolds?  Sir?
<s> Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a <i>six-hundred billion dollar</i> <i>organization!</i> Now god<u>dammit</u>, Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now!
<s> What about the tape?
<s> Do you have visual?
<s> He walked right up to me in church. At the holiest time of the wear. He approached me in a sanctified place.  Kill him now.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus - Candaules said to him I don't think you believe me when I tell you how beautiful my wife is. And although Gyges replied he did find the Queen magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women.  Do you all know this story?
<s> Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
<s> Excuse me?
<s> As the wife of one of our party.
<s> And that would be unconscionable, I suppose, to feel any obligation? Yes.  Of course it would.
<s> In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.
<s> It's a folk song.
<s> I thought we were against ownership?  I can stay tonight.
<s> That day, had you followed me to the market?
<s> Do you think you're the only one who feels anything?  Is that what you think?
<s> I know, darling, I'm sorry.
<s> Yes.  Absolutely.
<s> Listen to me, Katharine.  You've broken your ankle and I'm going to have to try and bind it.  I think your wrist might be broken, too - and some ribs, which is why it's hurting you to breathe.  I'm going to have to walk to El Taj.  Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or another before I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes and his camel.  And then I'll be back and we'll be fine, and I'll never leave you.
<s> Still a car.
<s> There you have me.
<s> Sorry, what's your point?
<s> What?
<s> Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.
<s> Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
<s> You should be happy.  What were you going to do for him when it ran out? He pulls out more phials from his jacket.
<s> I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love with ghosts.  And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
<s> What's happened?  Kip!  What's happening? Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody.
<s> I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
<s> I can't hide anymore.  I breathe like a dog.  I lose my balance.  Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.
<s> I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage.  It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face.
<s> Is there a song you don't know?
<s> Is that what you thought?  That I betrayed the British?  The British betrayed me.  The British betrayed me.
<s> Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise.  To come back for her. And then of course I couldn't… I couldn't even do that properly.
<s> Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.
<s> Very much so.  We are all, save my friend here.
<s> Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
<s> I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes.  What about your own book?
<s> Yes.  Dropping off.
<s> I can already see.
<s> Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
<s> He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
<s> K is for Katharine.
<s> Sikh.  If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh.
<s> We should charge!  Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
<s> Hey! -
<s> Would you like me to?
<s> I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
<s> Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
<s> You loved him.
<s> I'll always go back to that church.
<s> I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.
<s> A bit of one.
<s> Then you were married?
<s> There are times when you don't answer the phone.
<s> Through a window.
<s> Entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm.
<s> And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
<s> This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
<s> He's on to something bigger.
<s> Who am I?
<s> Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.
<s> Then don't.
<s> It's only on exhibit at the Queen's Museum this month. Even if you could get into the museum, the Mask bas its own security system. A special, randomly programmed interval code.
<s> Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.
<s> Can you follow simple directions?
<s> I'm a thief. Sue me.
<s> My job, my rules. We've got a job to do. No mixing business and pleasure.
<s> Good morning.
<s> A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
<s> A dozen times.
<s> Little celebration before we set off.
<s> He pulled back his arms and blam, I landed right on the floor. I picked myself up, tears in my eyes, and he looked at me and he said, Son, don't ever trust anybody. Anybody.
<s> Bookshelf. Sensors--
<s> It's a party.
<s> Behind you.
<s> Duh.
<s> A billion dollars.
<s> Speaking of money. You said billions. How many?
<s> And the money goes--
<s> Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times.
<s> Packed.
<s> Call it a new tradition.
<s> It was wrong to deceive you.
<s> What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?
<s> They drive so recklessly there.
<s> Nothing is wrong. Everything is the way it has to be. In my left coat pocket is a packet. Passports, hotel reservations, tickets.
<s> Both sides of the street, I'm afraid.
<s> Which is--
<s> Tina was a wonderful woman.
<s> It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.
<s> That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper.
<s> We're supposed to.
<s> Check out my ball.
<s> It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
<s> Probably not.
<s> Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
<s> It's those files you asked for.
<s> Right.
<s> Wow.  Why would they do that?
<s> Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by PG&E?
<s> And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
<s> Five million dollars.
<s> If you hadn't used profanity --
<s> I told you the questions might get a little personal --
<s> You said things would be fine, and they're not.
<s> Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
<s> I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
<s> Because they can.  You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal.  They can afford to waste all the time in the world.
<s> Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
<s> PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.
<s> Jesus Christ, Ed -- you know, the more I work on this thing, the more I realize what a crock of shit this legal system is.  Here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer -- that built a pool for a town, then filled it with toxic water -- and <u>we're</u> the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving things?  That's just not right.
<s> You didn't care about my case?
<s> From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously.
<s> They're trying to intimidate us.  Tell them to wait in the conference room.
<s> It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
<s> Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --
<s> <u>Not personal</u>?  That's my <u>work</u> in there, Ed. My sweat, my labor, my time.  If that's not personal, I don't know what is.
<s> I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
<s> Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime.  So in legal terms, ten years is --
<s> This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
<s> Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
<s> The extortion, the threats ...
<s> Sixty-nine.  We've got good answers to all of 'em.
<s> Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
<s> I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay?
<s> Every county has one.  They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction.  You should be able to find something there.
<s> Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before.
<s> I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".
<s> So did I.
<s> Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here.  Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it.  Does anyone know anything about these phones?
<s> You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised.
<s> Yeah.  She is.  But you know what?  That's why I'm helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.
<s> Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.
<s> Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.
<s> You need help with your kids?  I could probably do that.
<s> Yeah, and whose fault is that?
<s> I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.
<s> Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger.
<s> Lock the door.
<s> I need it.
<s> I pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be.
<s> It's not for me; it's for my kids.  You're the only one I trust them with.
<s> What do I look like, Erin?  A library?
<s> Have you been logging on?
<s> Yeah.  Who are you?
<s> Uh-huh?
<s> Outside with the sprinkler.  So it's good?
<s> We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
<s> You must.  Luke, look at me!
<s> I feel The Force.
<s> No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
<s> Howls.
<s> Chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
<s> Barks his agreement.
<s> Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
<s> Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
<s> Then I'll see you in Hell.
<s> The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
<s> There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.
<s> I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.
<s> Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...
<s> Forget it.
<s> I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from.
<s> I'm against that.
<s> Well, I hope you don't expect more.
<s> Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
<s> Would you please stop calling me that?
<s> That's quite a compliment.
<s> Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
<s> Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
<s> Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
<s> I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
<s> ... just remember that, Ôcause I'll be back ...
<s> I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.
<s> I think not.  But I don't wish my prize to be damaged.  We'll test it first.  Bring in Captain Solo.
<s> Not really.
<s> Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.
<s> I didn't say anything?
<s> We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
<s> Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
<s> Luke, no!  It's a trap.
<s> No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
<s> Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
<s> It is the future you see.
<s> Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!
<s> Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased.
<s> The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
<s> They're...pretending to dress.
<s> No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
<s> He jumped. Down there.  He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.
<s> Dream on, blue eye.
<s> Having second thoughts?
<s> Yeah, I got it.
<s> Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know.
<s> Delgado?
<s> I used to represent the guy who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.
<s> Yeah, kinda.
<s> Where?
<s> The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
<s> Utopia is lost to me. My daughter is gone.
<s> Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
<s> I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?
<s> Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
<s> We spared the lives of a few, so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of King Arthur's knights...
<s> It is deep...
<s> Lancelot, I will save you... Don't die.
<s> The book without pages. Open before you, all around us. You can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders.
<s> What's this, what's this?!
<s> ...to ride out and meet them.
<s> That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
<s> Is this a dream? Tell me, Merlin!
<s> Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.
<s> If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
<s> You and the land are one. Drink from the chalice. You will be reborn and the land with you.
<s> Yes. I would swear my love to you.
<s> I will run.
<s> Twenty days!? The world is that big?
<s> --It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
<s> Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
<s> Can it truly be used for magic?
<s> Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...
<s> Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.
<s> Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
<s> Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
<s> What's he doing there? Teaching?
<s> Of course I didn't.
<s> No, she was heavily sedated.
<s> Want to ask him?
<s> Of course. Have you got a pen?
<s> Yes, I think so.
<s> Why the math?
<s> Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
<s> You're kidding! Like what?
<s> She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
<s> Convulsion?
<s> What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?
<s> Please go away.
<s> Pretty close.
<s> Sure did.
<s> If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
<s> No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
<s> Well, the first thing I'd do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century.
<s> Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!
<s> No
<s> Well, me and Sharon played a game in the back yard, and we had a picnic down by the river.
<s> Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
<s> No you don't. I do it all the time.
<s> Captain Howdy.
<s> Here I'll show you.
<s> Well you know it's okay.
<s> Honey it's to help you.
<s> So something please Doctor, Help her!
<s> Okay.
<s> I came to say goodbye.
<s> How's the girl?
<s> That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
<s> What an excellent day for an exorcism.
<s> Why?
<s> Who places her trust in thee, my God.
<s> ... upon this your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil.
<s> Only what I read in the papers.
<s> Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
<s> Yeah, a fall.
<s> Are you tired?
<s> Just a minute.
<s> It's our goddamn car!
<s> Swimming trunks.
<s> I'll take her inside.  You too, little Frank.  Out of the pool.
<s> They're falling out.
<s> Isn't there something you can give him?  A pill or something?
<s> Two at a time?
<s> Get your hand off me.
<s> I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
<s> How's the birthday girl?
<s> Catholics.  What do you expect? Oh, well, what's in a name, right? Let's go inside and have a look at that cake.
<s> How we doing?
<s> Frank.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Why the interest?
<s> No thanks.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
<s> Terrific.
<s> I don't know what you mean.
<s> I thought maybe twenty percent. Look, with the additional bookings we'll come out ahead.  The big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice. We have to stay competitive, Jack.
<s> It's early.
<s> Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.
<s> You're a fucking alarm clock.
<s> I'll take my chances.
<s> You wanna get a drink?
<s> Right.
<s> Two years ago.  March.
<s> We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
<s> Come on, Jack.  It's not like it's the first time we've bunked together.  It'll be like when we were kids.  Relax.  Enjoy the view.
<s> It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
<s> A few bars!
<s> Yeah.  You mind?
<s> Doesn't it matter to you?
<s> Yes, really.  I don't want you to be unhappy, Jack.  If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune.
<s> Celebrating.  Join me?
<s> Right.  The Royal.  When's the last time we were there?
<s> Right.  It's incredible how you do that.  Remember things.
<s> We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
<s> That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
<s> Later.
<s> Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
<s> A few empty tables.  It's cozier. Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place on a Wednesday night.
<s> All right.
<s> Look, Nick.  You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
<s> Well, that's fine --
<s> We're finished.
<s> Don't take it personally.
<s> Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.
<s> Uh ... we'll let you know.
<s> When we know.
<s> What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?
<s> Where's my name?
<s> Do I look like I'm naked?
<s> What's wrong with it?
<s> Am I missing something?
<s> Hey!
<s> Big feet.
<s> Switch?  What fucking switch?
<s> I said I was sorry.
<s> Virgins.
<s> As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
<s> Huh?
<s> You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
<s> Huh?
<s> Uh, well ...
<s> Thanks, Lloyd.
<s> I'll call you.
<s> You know, I'm feeling a lot of hostility from you.
<s> Baker.
<s> Frank works hard.
<s> Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway.
<s> Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
<s> Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
<s> I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
<s> It's okay.  Last one.
<s> In and out.
<s> Just dinner and dance, right?
<s> Practice.  There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few.
<s> It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
<s> Who's Nina?
<s> So, what happened?
<s> Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
<s> You don't pick your brother.
<s> If I see him.
<s> Hi.
<s> I didn't want to wake you.
<s> What are they?
<s> I guess it's getting serious.
<s> Okay.  How'd yours go?
<s> Yeah?
<s> I'm not much for sweets.
<s> Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
<s> He hit a guard.
<s> Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
<s> Drive.
<s> Better than you bleeding all over my car upholstery. Trust me, Caz, you won't be here long.
<s> You're not holding him right ... Caz ...
<s> Shut up.
<s> Let me have a look.
<s> After that.  You promised you'd always take care of me.
<s> So you had a nightmare.
<s> I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
<s> -- I called, but I'm not Castor.  I'm your husband.
<s> Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
<s> Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
<s> You said it, Jon, not me.
<s> What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
<s> Well, I saw you -- Kim.
<s> They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?
<s> Gone?
<s> I'll have a talk with her. By the way, you never said anything about last night ...
<s> You?  Married?
<s> Hey Santa, where are you? Everybody’s here.
<s> I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?
<s> Really. So you’re projecting what, a tad over two million?
<s> I’m not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
<s> Five thirty.  Okay.
<s> Big Ed’s.
<s> Like what?
<s> I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...
<s> Is it...?
<s> Kate’s my wife...
<s> I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
<s> I’m telling you, those rules don’t apply to me, Arn.
<s> It’s me, Jack...
<s> Yes...Jack Campbell...
<s> What the hell are you talking about?  What’s he talking about?
<s> The Caddy?  Why don’t you take your own damn car!
<s> I call all you white guys "Jack."
<s> Hey...
<s> You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
<s> Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?
<s> I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse!
<s> Figure it out?  Figure what out?!
<s> Uh...sure Jack...  Right back there...
<s> For us, Kate.
<s> Uh huh...
<s> ...my feet are hurtin’...
<s> That is the general idea, yes...
<s> I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.
<s> You had a heart attack?
<s> That’s a big one for me, too.
<s> It’s like a museum.
<s> A perk for what?
<s> I’m moving to Paris...it was right here...  It’s a box marked “Jack.”  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
<s> You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
<s> Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
<s> Congratulations. The La Guardia flight’s canceled but I got you out of Kennedy on United at nine. Am I good or what?
<s> You'd never know it.
<s> He's made a few changes.
<s> Forget it, egghead.  I'm good as is.
<s> Keep talking, there won't <u>be</u> a next time.
<s> Give me the god damn mirror!
<s> The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
<s> Oh, he did.
<s> And they're changing into...
<s> What do you mean "complete"?
<s> Oh, it is.
<s> This place is deluxe.  You got cable?
<s> But all these people...
<s> I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are <i>right outside that window</i> --
<s> I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
<s> Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
<s> Okay, "mom."
<s> That's the temperature of the <u>sun</u>.
<s> Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
<s> You remember in school we talked about working together.  That's what I was about to explain...
<s> Not much.  We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
<s> Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll.  You remember my brother Johnny...
<s> I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
<s> Are you kidding?
<s> Of course.  Of course.
<s> It is.  There's something we need to talk about.  Something I need to ask you...
<s> We understand your concern, but we've made our decision, Doctor. Any questions? Anybody?
<s> Phase Two.
<s> That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
<s> No...
<s> But it's hopeless! They can't go back and they can't go on. I tell you there's nothing else we can do but remove them!
<s> The less time, the better.
<s> Message to Proteus.
<s> I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.
<s> It means killing Benes...  And for all we know, they may have completed the operation!  Damn it to hell!
<s> Before he could breathe a word. He's the only scientist who knows the answer to what we're after. That's why we have to operate --
<s> Here's the Surgeon.
<s> Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
<s> Tell him where he fits in, will you? I've got a few things to check out.
<s> No question of her loyalty.
<s> <Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
<s> They have...  But we've both got the same problem -- lack or control. We can only keep things Miniaturized for exactly sixty minutes. Arter that, everything starts growing back to its original size.
<s> Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
<s> Can't remember?... What do you mean?
<s> I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
<s> We'll know -- in the next breath...
<s> No danger of attack, as long as you don't trigger them off by any injury to the System.
<s> I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --
<s> Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
<s> And if it should take more time to get through --
<s> Doctor -- is it possible? That we're seeing it happen before our eyes?
<s> Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
<s> I feel much better now...
<s> Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
<s> Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
<s> Look! They follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:
<s> Yes...
<s> No, there's no other way.
<s> Then why not take it?
<s> We could follow the Optic Nerve to the corner of the Eye.
<s> At an operation?
<s> There's no other way. Tie my safety line to the sub.
<s> His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
<s> I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
<s> Let's hope they realize the danger.  Captain, I'll give you a new compass heading.
<s> Could I run a tube through that Wall, without harming Benes?
<s> Was there any damage?
<s> We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
<s> Yeah, I just came in. I decided not to park here.
<s> I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
<s> I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
<s> Certainly -
<s> HOLD ON! NO FUCKIN' WAY! YOU FUCKIN' NOTISH ISH? I GOT FUCKIN' SHOT INNA FAISH! I WENT'N GOTTA FUCKIN' MONEY! I GET SHOT FUCKIN' PICKIN' IT UP!  I BEEN UP FOR THIRTY-SHIKSH FUCKIN' HOURZH! I'M TAKIN' THAT FUCKIN' CAR! THAT FUCKERZH MINE!
<s> You're there in thirty minutes or I find you, Jerry, and I shoot you, and I shoot your fucking wife, and I shoot all your little fucking children, and I shoot 'em all in the back of their little fucking heads. Got it?
<s> Yah, but this TruCoat -
<s> Yah, I don't need no sealant though.
<s> Mr. Mohra?
<s> I unnerstand.
<s> Mm.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Jerry, we're not just going to give you seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
<s> They're playin' the Buckeyes!
<s> Ya kiddin'!
<s> Ma'am, I answered your question.
<s> I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here. I'm cooperating... There's no, uh - we're doin' all we can...
<s> Yeah, but we have an audit here, I just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist.
<s> Know who this is?
<s> Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department.
<s> Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then.  I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.
<s> Yah, okay.
<s> ...Who they playin'?
<s> You told me about it.
<s> What's goin' on there?
<s> We might be innarested.
<s> Yah.
<s> No, no. I - I'd, I'd - pay you back the principal, and interest heck, I'd go - one over prime -
<s> Yah, but think this thing through here, Wade. Ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go? You gotta listen to me on this one, Wade.
<s> Yah?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou.
<s> Yah?
<s> Yah - easy there - you do too!  I'm expecting, ya know.
<s> Yah, ya know it's the Radisson, so it's pretty good.
<s> Great. What brings ya down - are ya down here on that homicide - if you're allowed, ya know, to discuss that?
<s> No, no, that's fine.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> So?
<s> Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
<s> Yah?
<s> They're real good.
<s> Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.
<s> She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.
<s> He was killed in action.
<s> Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
<s> ...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
<s> I'd like to thank the academy...
<s> Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
<s> Can't you give me something?
<s> What?
<s> I don't know -- am I?
<s> Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia --
<s> Let's not make a big thing out of it.
<s> It suits you.
<s> Tragically, they're dead.  I'm alive and I'm in poverty.  You want any?
<s> Whatever.
<s> Chloe's dead.
<s> Do you care?
<s> That day you came over to my place to play doctor... what was going on there?
<s> What is wrong with you?
<s> Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
<s> I know that I've been... unwell.  I know it's been like there's two sides to me.
<s> No, no, shut up!  I've had enough. I tried, Tyler... I have tried...
<s> Oh, yeah.
<s> I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
<s> You fucking slut!!
<s> ... You know me?
<s> My suitcase was vibrating?
<s> Now, find your power animal.
<s> Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
<s> The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  That list.
<s> I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
<s> After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "Get a job."  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know. Get married."
<s> Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.
<s> Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
<s> Marla doesn't need a lover.  She needs a case worker.
<s> Don't mention me.
<s> Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.
<s> You quit?
<s> Work.  Going to work.
<s> An expired community college student ID card.  What did you used to study, Raymond K. Hessel?
<s> What's this all about, Tyler?
<s> What about Marla?
<s> I'm not going...
<s> This is not about martyrdom.
<s> I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.
<s> Defuse the bomb, please.
<s> i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
<s> Why what?
<s> You need me.
<s> What?
<s> There is no money.
<s> It's free to all.
<s> Pleeeeeease!
<s> I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
<s> What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
<s> I have to save Eugene!
<s> Holy shit.  He said "only new life can defeat death."  If she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born, a brand new soul that was never part of Death's Design...
<s> Don't sweat it.  It's over.
<s> I've got to stop and help those people.
<s> No.  What's this about?
<s> Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her?
<s> Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
<s> Yeah, I thought he was supposed to be helpful.
<s> How are we going to find her?  There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
<s> Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
<s> No time.  Keep going.  I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.
<s> Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean?
<s> That's crazy.  You can't give up now.  We can still fight this thing.
<s> I know.  I can feel it too.
<s> Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
<s> There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die, all of us, I saw it!
<s> I will, Dad.  Bye, luv you.
<s> What feeling?
<s> I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage.  And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was.  And the bad thoughts would go away.
<s> Yeah, but everything's always in transition. If you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel Autumn coming.  Almost like bein' able... to see the future.
<s> I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
<s> Ohmygod! OHMYGOD!  OHMYGOD!  He's not dead?
<s> Like... 4:25.
<s> No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
<s> Get out! Get out of the car!
<s> I wish you were on the plane!
<s> I know who you are.
<s> Me, right? That's why you're not saying.
<s> You have a responsibility to tell me.
<s> I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S TIME! I control my life! I control my death!
<s> WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
<s> That's right, buddy.
<s> No.
<s> What just happened?
<s> Clown?  Now back up there, buddy...
<s> Ninety.
<s> Show me how it operates.
<s> This is state-of-the-art firepower.
<s> There's a compass in the handle.
<s> I need a vacation.
<s> Guard barracks.  Take some shots.
<s> I suppose you have...
<s> It means "virgin."  My mother was comedian.
<s> They heard about escaped prisoner on radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.
<s> Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.
<s> You think you are... .
<s> Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
<s> Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
<s> Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight.  Unless you have an objection.
<s> It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.
<s> That's it.  My life.
<s> Do I look like I have someone special?
<s> Meeting ... people.
<s> I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.
<s> Really?
<s> It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
<s> Okay.  ... I love you...
<s> You didn't kill anybody.  Stop.
<s> The moron?
<s> And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....
<s> He just needs some clothes?
<s> All right... I'll pack my stuff tonight.
<s> <u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
<s> I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
<s> I... I was just leaving.
<s> Yes.  They're free.
<s> What girl?  I didn't notice.
<s> I know a great place.  ...UH...WARREN!
<s> But I need help and <u>they</u> sent you.
<s> Parry!
<s> Fifty dollars?
<s> You're totally gone, aren't you?
<s> Bingo!
<s> Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
<s> Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
<s> Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
<s> I know!
<s> I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
<s> You don't have to say that.
<s> Listen, I'm not feeling well.
<s> Listen, you're very nice... b...
<s> I got accused a robbin' a fillin'station down in the Indian Nation, didn' I tell you...
<s> Out where?
<s> Yeah, great.  Why don't you throw Z's for 19 frames, and then roll a strike on the last ball in the last frame of a losing game? Just wonderful.
<s> If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.
<s> It brings out my eyes...
<s> Fill it up.
<s> Alaska? Are you on vacation?
<s> Shut up.  You have bread, don't you, and a toaster of some kind?
<s> I didn't get it, did I?
<s> But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
<s> Would you like to talk to the manager?
<s> Okay, I'll make it as easy for you as I can. Give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee.
<s> Now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven't broken any rules.
<s> Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
<s> Hi, Tita.
<s> Don't, then.
<s> Well, I don't mean to.  Here's your tea, Tita.
<s> This is a very special, very old CB 275...
<s> You know who it once belonged to?
<s> Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
<s> Wait...
<s> Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
<s> What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
<s> Uhm hmm.
<s> You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
<s> Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
<s> Yeah, well, he's...
<s> Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
<s> My turn.
<s> I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
<s> What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
<s> I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
<s> No, you're very good at it. I'm really impressed.
<s> I don't think that's accurate...
<s> I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
<s> Yes, that's what's important to me...
<s> That's right.
<s> I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
<s> Yes.
<s> Is she?
<s> You're all full of shit!
<s> Will you shut up for a minute!!  Pull your car out of line.
<s> What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
<s> You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia... Excuse me.
<s> Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad. It's filth. Filth is bad. That's what starts maggots and riots...
<s> What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.
<s> In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...
<s> Victor.
<s> How old is he?
<s> You gonna talk to him?
<s> She's like this high, dark hair, skinny
<s> She didn't say she had no man.
<s> Positive.
<s> Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
<s> Alan Stanwyk is not involved in improprieties. Where the hell does the S.E.C. come off --
<s> Utah?  Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.
<s> You're kidding.
<s> Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
<s> Not luck. They don't want me.
<s> Full name.
<s> It was planted on me, sir.
<s> Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
<s> Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.
<s> We play tennis at the club.
<s> Your aunt?
<s> I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
<s> Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
<s> For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.
<s> Where am I?
<s> That's it?
<s> What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
<s> That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
<s> Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
<s> I'd have been long gone.
<s> Yes. Where you from, Harry?
<s> That's right. Alan comes by every three weeks or so.
<s> Right.
<s> No problem.
<s> Fletch?
<s> Fletch, I never sold nothing.
<s> I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.
<s> You sure those doors will be open?
<s> You've met her?
<s> Cute thing.
<s> No, thank you.
<s> John Ultrarelamensky.
<s> It's Scotch-Rumanian.
<s> So were my parents.
<s> I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
<s> I ordered lunch.
<s> Yes.
<s> No. He was. I got him out.
<s> Depends on the question.
<s> No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
<s> What is this?
<s> Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
<s> How do you know about that?
<s> I'm calling the police. Right now.
<s> You shouldn't be here.
<s> Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?
<s> This morning.
<s> Go ahead. Call them. Better tie your shoelaces first.
<s> Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
<s> Uh, almost.
<s> No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
<s> Well, there we're in a gray area.
<s> Utah?
<s> Who? Donnie and Marie?
<s> It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.
<s> I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.
<s> Jim Swarthout?
<s> Frieda's boss.
<s> But how did you know?  Here, take this picture...
<s> Oh... I have some questions.
<s> What did these Vancouver factories do?
<s> Great pipes.
<s> No prob...
<s> I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a police record, though. Not even Synchronicity.  Have you checked out Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch's houseboat yet?
<s> You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
<s> Lieutenant Anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
<s> I've always said the one reason I'm the best detective in the industry is that I'm the only one... but hey, I never throw away a clue...
<s> You're not funny.
<s> You gave it to the girls for one.
<s> Why are all these people after me?
<s> I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...
<s> No.  Who's Art Mooney?
<s> Ye-ah.  Sure.
<s> Ye-ah.
<s> Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
<s> There's that question...
<s> ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.
<s> Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.
<s> You think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women.  You think you're so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring...
<s> I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
<s> Fine!
<s> <u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.
<s> Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
<s> Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits.  Shit, just start torturing me, man.  I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.
<s> It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.
<s> Are you okay?
<s> Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
<s> Julian, you're fired.
<s> Only on a first name basis.
<s> It is to us!  It's computerised.
<s> No - no.
<s> Takin' care o' business, honey.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
<s> It's yours too!
<s> It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
<s> Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
<s> What's he do?
<s> Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
<s> A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
<s> Morning.  Sometime.
<s> Bill, keep shootin' your mouth off and I'll knock you into the middle of next week.
<s> Nothing in there except a New York street map.
<s> Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.
<s> Hey, I thought we come for a drink.
<s> A and A, that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass.
<s> Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
<s> Yeah.
<s> We also got Bill Mulderig and Phil Klein.
<s> Why is it called Hellgate?
<s> What is that old building?
<s> I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.
<s> Switches are shorted out.
<s> Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
<s> Don't know what's behind it.
<s> One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
<s> I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside.
<s> Do you know where I found this?
<s> No.  This isn't what you think.
<s> He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
<s> Next time lets put some money on it.
<s> Queens, New York.
<s> I don't really follow baseball anymore.
<s> This afternoon?
<s> W...B...2...YXB.
<s> What?
<s> What if it's not...
<s> Sun spot?
<s> 1998.
<s> I'm not doing anything.  Look, I don't know what's going on.  But I swear on my life, I"m here at your old desk, on your Ham, in our house, right now...in 1998.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> It's Mom.
<s> She's not here.
<s> No Dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me.
<s> Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
<s> I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I do.
<s> Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.
<s> Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...
<s> Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
<s> No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
<s> In my pocket.
<s> Okay, okay...
<s> Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
<s> Gordo?
<s> She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
<s> Whoa, I just...I just...
<s> I'm sorry.  I just...you know...I...
<s> Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
<s> Yeah.  Sure.
<s> Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
<s> You work too hard, John.
<s> Yeah, that's right.
<s> I try to be.
<s> It's a small world, Carl.  And I'm gonna find you.  Real soon.
<s> "He" wanted me to warn you.  Look at this, all of you!
<s> I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
<s> I don't know...
<s> Okay.  There's a whole weekend ahead of us.  There's time.
<s> Are you all right, Shelly?
<s> You promised you'd never ask me.
<s> It's all right, you're all right. I'm with you.
<s> Why don't you help us?
<s> Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.
<s> It was nothing.
<s> Damn you, Shelly!
<s> Why?
<s> Stay cool?  You ain't Dirty Harry. Now stop it.
<s> Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
<s> He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
<s> Sheriff, you better take this.
<s> You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
<s> He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.
<s> We'll scare 'em right back.
<s> Yeah, we're here.
<s> Yeah...They should've paid their bill.
<s> They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter.  Ya' can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of his body.  He'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr. Campbell.
<s> -- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
<s> Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?
<s> Then maybe I should offer it to your daughter...
<s> You know what I want.  You know why I need you.
<s> I know everything about you, Diana.
<s> June the 19th.
<s> Sorry, Di.  I was just going to my car.  I didn't mean to frighten you...
<s> Okay.
<s> For a good reason.
<s> Information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.
<s> I was going to, I was going to tell everyone.  I just...didn't expect to be back here so soon.  Is Steven around?
<s> Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?
<s> I'm now begging you.
<s> Okay.
<s> That's a lie.  Diana would never talk to you about Jessica.  Not after what you did to her.
<s> She did!
<s> She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
<s> Disgusting?  Bingo night was sold out for six months after that!  They raised enough money to build a day care center.
<s> The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
<s> What are you going to do?
<s> My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
<s> Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter.  Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water...
<s> Yeah.
<s> Hear what?
<s> It's...dead.
<s> And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.
<s> No, I think it's just the beginning.
<s> Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen.
<s> That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.
<s> You're telling a lie.
<s> You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
<s> I was only trying to teach you. But I pulled you out, Rennie. I saved your life.
<s> Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
<s> Asbestos lining.
<s> It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
<s> Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.
<s> I don't have the problems that artists have.
<s> Then you should carry a gun.
<s> `The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
<s> About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
<s> Did you see the winning run score?
<s> This could be it.
<s> You know about Adele.
<s> They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
<s> They'll lose because they're my team.
<s> Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
<s> Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
<s> Your mother and I have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. Believe me, I know this. That's right, nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn't only my wife. She's my best friend.
<s> This person and I are a thing of the total past. I promise you.
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> Packs an emotional wallop.
<s> Yes.
<s> An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.
<s> I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi. But let's put a lid on the questions.
<s> They're always winning. Until they lose.
<s> Right here. At the door.
<s> He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
<s> This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
<s> Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
<s> I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
<s> If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night.
<s> hat was this morning.
<s> How come?
<s> I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
<s> He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
<s> He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
<s> Is what true?
<s> Our Steven not only disguises himself.
<s> Stop!
<s> Not without defeats -- and great pain.  But are there no defeats in this war -- no pain?  What you cannot do is accept injustice. From Hitler -- or anyone. You must make the injustice visible -- be prepared to die like a soldier to do so.
<s> No. That is what you get for distracting me.
<s> Let me hang on with two hands or I will fall.
<s> The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
<s> I hope not.
<s> Even as a boy I thought so.
<s> Hm.  Is it?
<s> A great deal.
<s> No... no. In every temple and mosque they have pledged to die before they lift a hand against each other.
<s> I --
<s> An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.  We must stop.
<s> No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.
<s> My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
<s> It's split the Government.
<s> Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
<s> Bapu -- please. Where are you going.
<s> I guess I'm a slow learner.
<s> No, <i>this</i> is your man.
<s> No.  Not <i>likely</i>.
<s> It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window.
<s> Blood.  From the vein.
<s> Thank you, no.
<s> I will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission.  We're already counting backwards.
<s> I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
<s> What's wrong with him?
<s> If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you.  You are a disappointment, Jerome.
<s> They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
<s> --What car?--Go to sleep.
<s> I'm proud of you, Vincent.
<s> I'm sorry.  I think I was crying.
<s> Complicated.  I couldn't stop her apologizing.
<s> Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.
<s> I could always walk.  I've been faking it.
<s> How do I square the accident?
<s> How tall are you?
<s> No it can't be verified.  Yes I was alone.
<s> You celebrate, Jerome?
<s> What exactly is wrong?
<s> Let's walk.
<s> Come on.
<s> But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your--  --nose.  How perfect does your child have to be?
<s> That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.
<s> Only every time I'm in here.
<s> I'll tell you at the end of the week.
<s> There's a problem, Lamar.
<s> No, you don't understand.  I <i>can't</i>.
<s> I'm not doing it.
<s> Not like <i>this</i> one.
<s> Antonio--
<s> I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
<s> Get it over with...
<s> It looks fine.
<s> I want to take a walk.
<s> I've been doing my homework.
<s> Assumed name... Houston.
<s> After four years and now the question comes up.
<s> Is he straight?
<s> Want to cry now?
<s> For exits off Main Street.
<s> I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
<s> I've never "been there... When we met it was in his office.
<s> It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
<s> I mean it.
<s> El Paso.
<s> When are you going to learn?
<s> No scars.
<s> Whatever happens it's over.
<s> I don't see how.
<s> Pull over.
<s> Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
<s> No, I'm afraid not.
<s> I really hope you have a nice trip.
<s> Tell her you robbed a bank...
<s> Aren't we going a little hard?
<s> Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
<s> Sure thing, mister, it's coming right up. 'Bout an hour. Quiet crossing that is.
<s> What's it to you?
<s> Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
<s> Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
<s> 'Good.'
<s> Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What name?
<s> Why?
<s> Jack...
<s> Who sent you, Thorpey?
<s> You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?
<s> While he was here. You went about together?
<s> Of course. Where else?
<s> What girl?
<s> No.
<s> No. I'll be off now. I should be at work.
<s> No. It's all right.
<s> Yeah.
<s> They said he was drunk.
<s> Yes.
<s> Nobody seems to know.
<s> Get knotted.
<s> My brother, Frank.
<s> Funny.  Can I phone London?
<s> No, you won't.
<s> That little shit!
<s> What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
<s> Yes, thank you.
<s> Not much.
<s> How could I stay away?
<s> A bereavement. A death in the family.
<s> Yeah,  Come off it, Eric. Who is it?
<s> I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
<s> Making a living.
<s> No? Funny that. Neither did I.
<s> Knock it off, Gerald.
<s> Three hundred altogether, Harry.
<s> To get on the...
<s> I...I don't know.
<s> What?
<s> And now...
<s> You get a bad month, all of a...
<s> It's not right.
<s> Eh?
<s> For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
<s> Look at Jerry Graff.  He's clean, he's doing business for himself, he's got his, that list of his with the nurses...see?  You see?  That's thinking.  Why take ten percent?  A ten percent comm...why are we giving the rest away?  What are we giving ninety per...for nothing. For some jerk sit in the office tell you "Get out there and close." "Go win the Cadillac." Graff.  He goes out and buys.  He pays top dollar for the... you see?
<s> The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
<s> That's the truth...
<s> Huh.
<s> You...
<s> As a robbery.
<s> What did you say?
<s> We are?
<s> That's right.
<s> What will he pay?
<s> You have to steal the leads tonight?
<s> What if you don't get caught?
<s> Absolutely.
<s> You went for it.
<s> It's a waste of time.
<s> That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George.
<s> You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
<s> He filed half of them, he filed the big one.  All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and...ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the...  I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone's self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where's the phones?
<s> To the cops?
<s> Was I?
<s> When I talk to the police, I get nervous.
<s> Where did Moss...?  I...
<s> No.
<s> We had a robbery. 
<s> Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
<s> I didn't...why should I..."Where were you last..." Is anybody listening to me...?  Where's Moss...?  Where...?
<s> Will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here...
<s> Did they find the guy who broke into the office yet?
<s> Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.
<s> How the fuck do I know?  What...talk to me.
<s> Please don't leave.  I'm going to talk to you.  What's your name?
<s> Levene!!
<s> I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
<s> Could I...
<s> And let's put this together.  Okay? Shel?  Say okay.
<s> I'm going to the Chinks.  You're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette.
<s> Get in the goddamn room.
<s> ...you didn't close...
<s> ...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...?
<s> Roma.
<s> Moss.
<s> Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do what I'm hired to do. I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to watch the leads.  I'm given...hold on, I'm given a policy.  My job is to do that.  What I'm told.  That's it.  You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.
<s> Murray said...
<s> What if you don't?  Then I'm fucked. You see...?  Then it's my job. That's what I'm telling you.
<s> No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
<s> Bullshit.  They ain't been in the office yet.  Give 'em some stiff. We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of 'em, six and ten, you can do it...six and ten...eight and eleven, I don't give a shit, you set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits in Des Plaines.
<s> Now.  Yes...When?
<s> That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
<s> You can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed.  You hear me?  I'm talking to you. Do you hear me...?
<s> You're so full of shit.
<s> Was it?
<s> Forget it.  Frame it.  It's worthless.
<s> Will you shut up, I'm telling you this...
<s> Shut the fuck up.  Ricky.  You have a mean streak in you...  And what the fuck are you babbling about...? 
<s> Hey, big fucking deal.  Broke a bad streak...
<s> They took the phones...
<s> No, his wife is.
<s> I'm sorry, Jim.  I can't talk now. I'll call you tonight...I'm sorry. I'm coming, Ray. 
<s> I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...
<s> If we wait till Mon...
<s> We'll speak to her, Jim...
<s> I don't have the power.  I said it.
<s> She told me I had to get back the check or call the State's att...
<s> Not to my knowledge, no...
<s> Guess who?
<s> Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.
<s> And fuck you.  Fuck the lot of you. Fuck you all.
<s> They didn't get my contracts.
<s> Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac.
<s> If you don't want it, give it back.
<s> Three.
<s> I'm not hungry.
<s> This is swell.  Where's Michael? I've got things to get straight with him and I can't wait on line.
<s> You're not my father!
<s> Because I need MONEY!
<s> It was my father's money; and I'm entitled to what I need.  Where is Tom Hagen?
<s> Tom is right.
<s> The children can stay.
<s> Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor.
<s> Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
<s> Mike, what can I do, she's a hysterical woman...
<s> Let's go.
<s> That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about.  What's with him, I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'?
<s> Mio fratello.
<s> We're making an investment in Havana.
<s> It was hard to have him killed.
<s> What's that?
<s> Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
<s> What is it?  Can I help?
<s> Nowhere, Mike.  I wanted to get a refill.  How about you?
<s> Beautiful.
<s> What?
<s> No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?
<s> With Mama, putting the baby to sleep.  Francesca's very happy. Michael was kind to her.  She idolizes him.  The children are all out in the speedboat.  I'm going to my house.
<s> Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.
<s> Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
<s> Sure, Mikey.
<s> She took the Senate Investigation worse.
<s> I don't know.
<s> I'm staying.  Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of all this; Sonny never listened to me about that.  Now, explain everything to me.
<s> That's my brother.  Nothing could get him away from that two mule town.  He coulda been big over here -- he could of had his own Family.
<s> Do you gamble?
<s> Our mistake.  But what does it matter; it was our money.  We don't even expect thanks.
<s> The committee is adjourned until further notice.
<s> I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're not to let you through.
<s> Tell me, Michael.  What really happened with Pentangeli?
<s> And that's all he had to do.  Just show his face.
<s> Your family?  How can you ever lose your family?
<s> The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.
<s> Technically, they are still under the Clemenza wing of the Corleone Family, now run by Frankie Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died, the Rosatos wanted territory of their own.  Pentangeli refused, and came to me, asking for permission to eliminate them.  I, of course, knew of their relationship with you, and in gratitude for your help with the Tropicana matter, turned him down.  Pentangeli was furious, and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed. I was lucky and he was stupid. I'll visit him soon.  The important thing is that nothing jeopardize our plans, yours and mine.  This thing of ours, that we will build.
<s> Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
<s> The money was sent.
<s> They feel cheated.
<s> Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.
<s> Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
<s> Michael, anything.  What is it I can do for you?
<s> Always... But sometimes I don't understand.  I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers.
<s> Sitting right behind you.
<s> We got no choice.
<s> How much more a month?
<s> Yes.
<s> What was that?
<s> All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.
<s> Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
<s> I'm not a kid.
<s> Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone?  Pathetic and alone.
<s> Well...no, not really --
<s> I put him to bed.  He's not there?
<s> He says here good-bye.  I find it in his room.  He is sorry, he says. He has had a wonderful life.
<s> You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
<s> But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were.  Tell me, do you like motion pictures?
<s> You don't say?  Which picture?
<s> You don't think of me that way, do you?
<s> You know.  Look at me like -- like I look at women.
<s> No.  I --
<s> In a way, yes.  I suppose so.  I know it's why I stopped making pictures.
<s> Do I look okay?
<s> Nothing of importance.  Just two old men slapping each other with lilies.  Shall we have a drink?
<s> Run for what?
<s> You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon.
<s> Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
<s> I thought you'd given up on my picture.
<s> But you said --
<s> The Great War?
<s> Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
<s> I'm very sorry.
<s> Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
<s> I haven't done a damn thing with you!
<s> You're crazy.
<s> All right.
<s> Ooooh.
<s> She took the night off.  Heavy date.  Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.
<s> You only embarrass yourself.
<s> You know what I mean.  Your reputation.
<s> Yes.  Perfectly.
<s> Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?
<s> No, Hanna.  My heart isn't that black.
<s> I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
<s> Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.
<s> How much longer before we get to "Frankenstein"?
<s> Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --
<s> It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
<s> Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?
<s> Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
<s> Don't go away.
<s> Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
<s> About your brother. And the deeeep shit he's in --
<s> We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...
<s> How ya doing?
<s> I knew you'd say that, too --
<s> Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...
<s> You got no choice. It's over.
<s> Let them go. And I'll leave ...
<s> Get out of here, then. Now.
<s> Something like that -
<s> Your girl works in there ...
<s> Needs brightening ...
<s> Sure. But sometimes we got to create some numbers. The task force is run by statistics, you know ...
<s> Donny-nothin'!
<s> Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is our electronics expert. He's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; Tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; Toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing ...
<s> Peugot convertible ...
<s> Okay, okay. The important thing to remember, is to Think Slow. Take your time. It may not seem like it, but the night is long. Long enough. Just think slow and think smart...
<s> Atley Jackson came to see me ...
<s> Oh, for God's sake
<s> What do you say, Toby?,
<s> Yeah... You want a ride...
<s> Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?
<s> Yeah, man. Where is your beer?
<s> Something like that -
<s> Okay --
<s> C'mon, man... My "demise..."  Overreaction
<s> What?
<s> Thought I'd go for a ride -
<s> What for -- ?
<s> Now, we go -
<s> Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -
<s> For real?
<s> No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
<s> Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
<s> If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...
<s> Oh, yeah.
<s> No. Open her ...
<s> Deodorant.
<s> "Unlock my button" ... ?
<s> What's that?
<s> "A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that.
<s> The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
<s> I'll see you soon --
<s> Who's "Eleanor?"
<s> Billy, how are you?
<s> Nods.
<s> It was easy money. I did it in the can.  Shit! I learned the junk business in the can, Paulie.
<s> I thought you were going to stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything. What did you expect. Tommy was all over me. Right?
<s> What bag?
<s> I'm just having my last few drinks.
<s> Shit.
<s> Paul will calm down. You'll see.
<s> Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.
<s> I got seared.
<s> Paulie was just talking about him.
<s> Jimmy.
<s> What's going on? What happened to Stacks? Is everything okay?
<s> He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.
<s> --or a tail--
<s> What are we gonna do up there?
<s> Jesus Christ. Not even close.
<s> You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
<s> What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
<s> Let's take a walk. EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY
<s> Yeah, it is.
<s> I told you, I just got change.
<s> I'm Irish.
<s> Come now...what do you think I am, a juvinile? You don't got any money on you right now. You think I'm gonna take a check? EXECUTIVE It's fine, John, I can cover the rest.
<s> Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, Will.  I've already spoken to one therapist, his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a friend of mine. He's also published four books and is widely considered to be one of the brightest men in his field.  I'm sure it'll be better than spending the next six months in jail.
<s> I'm pretty sure it's right.
<s> I'll cancel every meeting right now. I'll give you a job myself. I just wanted you to see what was out there.
<s> Sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. Think of how many fights you could have been in by now.
<s> Pleasure to meet you.
<s> I've been busy.
<s> That would be fine.
<s> Tom.
<s> I think so.
<s> Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
<s> Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
<s> I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
<s> Why is he hiding? Why is he a janitor? Why doesn't he trust anybody? Because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!
<s> I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
<s> He's not you!
<s> I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
<s> I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.
<s> What's the point?
<s> Let's hit "Kelly's."
<s> Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
<s> --you have a quality-- something you were born with, that you have no control over- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. And I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm friends with the janitor that works in my building. He's been to my house for dinner. As a matter of fact I did some free consultation for "Mike" -- that's not his real name. That's in my book.
<s> I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
<s> No.
<s> Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.
<s> Maybe you married the wrong woman.
<s> Time's up.
<s> I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me?
<s> You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Hence, the word remarried.
<s> Well I think that's a wonderful philosophy, Sean. That way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone.
<s> No, I don't.
<s> What? Do I wonder if I'd be better off if I never met my wife?
<s> "I gotta go see about a girl"? What did they say?
<s> Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?
<s> If you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.
<s> You're not going to fail me are you?
<s> It's not your fault.
<s> Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
<s> Okay, sounds good.
<s> Okay...
<s> Not far from here, South Boston.
<s> 'Cause it's nicer than my place.
<s> Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
<s> Then on behalf of my weiner, I'd like to ask for an advance.
<s> Fine.
<s> I guess so.
<s> Like me?
<s> Come one Will. I just want to know.
<s> No.
<s> What?
<s> I love you, Will.  No take-backs.
<s> We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
<s> But ef you *do* whup me, I swear you better not ever go to sleep again, because the minute you go to sleep, or you're settin' down, or your back's turned, I'm gonna knock you belly-up with a bucket.
<s> You're *ticklin' me!*
<s> We got to get outa here right away. Ever'body here? Where's Uncle John?
<s> Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
<s> Sure, but what is this?
<s> Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?
<s> Why ain't they more like it?
<s> Goodnight.
<s> I don't mind any more. I'd do what I done again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash.
<s> No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?
<s> Just around that next bend.
<s> That's our place.
<s> I never heard nothin' about it.
<s> Try an' tell 'em, Tom. They'll get two an' a half, jus' the minute we're gone. An' you know what that is? That's one ton a peaches picked an' carried for a dollar. That way you can't even buy food enough to keep you alive! Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom! Them peaches is *ripe*. Two days out an' they'll pay *all* of us five!
<s> But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!
<s> We was outa food. Tonight we had meat. Not much, but we had it. Think Pa's gonna give up his meat on account a other fellas? An' Rosasharn needs milk. Think Ma's gonna starve that baby jus' cause a bunch a fellas is yellin' outside a gate?
<s> Women is always tar'd.
<s> Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
<s> Little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through. Just follow the line.
<s> But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
<s> You know what I mean. You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been?
<s> Listen. That big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' it a secret. I been in the penitentiary. Been there four years. Like to know anything else?
<s> This here's a strike.
<s> Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
<s> You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
<s> Now don't get sassy, Ma.
<s> I never *seen* her so sassy.  An' she ain't so young, neither!
<s> Sassy my foot! I'm jus' sick and tar'd a my folks tryin' to bust up. All we got lef' in the *worl'* is the fambly--an' right down at bottom that's all we *got* to have! Ef some of us dies, we can't he'p that--but ain't nobody else runnin' away!
<s> Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be--
<s> Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us. 
<s> No.
<s> Okay, Ma. Don't you worry.
<s> I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.
<s> Girl with a baby *always* gets prettier.
<s> Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am.
<s> I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
<s> Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
<s> California, here we come!
<s> Me an' you both.
<s> I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!
<s> Lissen. You done busted it. You hear?  But lissen here. I won't tell nobody, y'understan'?
<s> Morning.
<s> I'm Martin Blank.
<s> Whatever I can get away with.
<s> Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us up in the grandstands?
<s> Really...? So what?
<s> Fine, Bob. How are you?
<s> What do you want to do?
<s> A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
<s> Overflowing with love.
<s> What's that?
<s> I'll think about it.
<s> We haven't seen each other since high school.
<s> Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
<s> You never could have kept this from me.
<s> I'm staying here.
<s> I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
<s> What stuff?
<s> If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
<s> Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
<s> Up on the right.
<s> Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
<s> Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette.
<s> Hey, Bob.
<s> --Nooo--
<s> It was the PLO.
<s> If he does our job, he's our job.
<s> This?
<s> It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
<s> Good. What else? Anything interesting?
<s> Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's a full dossier. Very comprehensive.
<s> I'll do it tomorrow.
<s> I've looked at it.
<s> That's wonderful, Mom.
<s> Nature made him then broke the mold.
<s> You don't have a headache. I have a headache.
<s> I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
<s> Yeah...
<s> I have always thought about her and missed her.
<s> Paul?
<s> Good evening, Mr. Blank.
<s> Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
<s> All by yourself?
<s> Well, I, uh... you didn't...
<s> Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
<s> Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.
<s> He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
<s> Five years. My son was born here.
<s> It is. It's lovely.
<s> We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.
<s> That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
<s> The point was to love each other.
<s> Okay.
<s> Mom?
<s> I mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why can't they be compassionate to me?
<s> I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
<s> I didn't know I had to.
<s> You were never thirteen, Mom.
<s> There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
<s> You're right. Good.
<s> ... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
<s> Well, now you know what it feels like.
<s> Because you are... one of the most... incredible, bravest, most beautiful woman I have ever met. The efforts you make. Your courage and your dignity.  I don't know where you got it? I honestly don't know how I would have handled all this if I were you.
<s> Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
<s> Exactly...
<s> Sing it to me, Frankie!
<s> I love you.
<s> They're still our friends, Annie. It's nothing serious. You kid about them all the time... And I could tell Paul really appreciated me being there.
<s> No.
<s> Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
<s> I'm not asking you to. I'll do it.
<s> She will if you think she should.
<s> About what?
<s> You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
<s> Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
<s> Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
<s> I'd love to go there one time...
<s> Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
<s> Probably best. You may want to shoot yourself half way to Ohio.
<s> Oh hell, I don't know... According to Tom, she's a pretty determined woman. Must've thought it was worth it.
<s> That's what some folks say.
<s> You know her?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Our daddy raised Pure Herefords.
<s> He thought it was a ghost.
<s> Because it fits my head. You want to try it on?
<s> Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
<s> She's an editor.
<s> I don't know if I can with my leg.
<s> Sure.
<s> No!
<s> Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
<s> I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
<s> Hack the Planet!
<s> Devil book. The Unix Bible.
<s> I want it.
<s> Yo, man, you an amateur, man.
<s> Cereal.
<s> Curtis.
<s> No, don't know who he is.  Do you?
<s> Dead?
<s> Revenge.
<s> Nah. I don't play well with others.
<s> Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
<s> This is the end, my friend.  Thank you for calling!
<s> How did you know that?
<s> What's this one eat?
<s> Yeah! Sure.
<s> Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
<s> I didn't know what was on it.
<s> It's my subway defense system.
<s> Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson.
<s> Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
<s> They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
<s> Dreams?
<s> Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?
<s> I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
<s> No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the time they realize the truth, we'll be long gone with all of our money.
<s> So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys.
<s> Michael Myers.
<s> What does that mean?
<s> Brady! Come with us.
<s> Get up there Rachel!
<s> Go!
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Mom, I'm on a diet. You want an oinker for a daughter?
<s> Honey, this tie has a spot on it, I can't wear this today. I got a 10:30 with Chuck.
<s> How do you know their not?
<s> I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
<s> How many bodies did you find?
<s> I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
<s> Police station. I ain't closing down with out a good goddamn reason.
<s> Al here lost his boy 10 years back.
<s> Do you love me Rachel?
<s> You ready for some Ice Cream?
<s> In a second.
<s> He's coming to get me Rachel.
<s> No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
<s> Dad, what's going on?
<s> I don't want to look pushy.
<s> This is 132, over.
<s> What are we doing?
<s> Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.
<s> Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
<s> He's been here.
<s> Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.
<s> Anything for a fellow pilgrim. Sometimes we need help getting where we want to be.  Reverend Jackson Pete Sayer of Dumon County, please to make your aquanauts.
<s> All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan.
<s> What happened?
<s> Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
<s> The guys think I'm too smart.
<s> Why did you hang up on me?
<s> I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.
<s> He can still watch.
<s> Here, Lester.
<s> No, he's not.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Michael's around someplace...
<s> He isn't a man.
<s> Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
<s> I found the car! He's here!
<s> Totally.
<s> Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
<s> Why are they under there?
<s> There was no one outside.
<s> No! Do as I say.
<s> Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?
<s> Of course not.
<s> Mmm.
<s> Oh, it's magnificent!
<s> Uh...
<s> Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
<s> Yes.
<s> Oh, okay.
<s> This time I really think I have something.
<s> You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
<s> Could you--
<s> Oh.  Well, I live--
<s> Well, i-if-if you have some free time...
<s> Yes, it's-it's wonderful.
<s> You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
<s> Oh, that's nice.
<s> I know this.  Bach.  F Minor Concerto.  It's one of my favorites.
<s> Yes, he's just adorable.
<s> Oh, right.
<s> Why, you know the situation.
<s> Why?
<s> Yes!  But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
<s> Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
<s> Oh, my God.
<s> Yeah, I know.  I-I can't believe I forgot.
<s> Was I?
<s> But, you got four children!
<s> Are you angry with me?
<s> Me?  Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.
<s> Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH  You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject.  What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less.  You sleep with me less and less.
<s> And we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year...her great success in A Doll's House!
<s> That thought doesn't terrify you?
<s> I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
<s> Yeah, I know.  But never to exist again!
<s> Mom, come out!
<s> You missed a very dull TV show about Auschwitz.  More gruesome film clips...and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions.
<s> You are, you are my only connection to the world!
<s> Jesus...Jesus!
<s> You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!
<s> No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
<s> Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you?  That makes everything...
<s> I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise  I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.
<s> Doesn't she look pretty?
<s> Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
<s> You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
<s> The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!
<s> True.
<s> Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so  we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Uh-oh.
<s> Oooo.
<s> What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
<s> You got it.
<s> Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And...  you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money. 
<s> Yeah, that's clerical.
<s> Take...take a year.  Take six months.  Whatever you want.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
<s> Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
<s> Yeah, that's tough!  You don't deserve Cole Porter.  You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!
<s> ...in a really horrible way.
<s> I'm okay.
<s> Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
<s> So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one.
<s> Just a few minutes ago.
<s> Oh...
<s> Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.  What's to eat?

<s> And how did she get close enough to disarm you?
<s> You nervous...?
<s> How's your <u>child</u>?
<s> 'bout time you <u>learned</u>...
<s> And how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in Torture?
<s> Then, she, <u>herself</u>, possessed some knowledge of the Greater World...How pleased am I to see you looking so well...
<s> ...how so?
<s> And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?

No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World.  I would say, you have been in America.  Have I struck home?

<s> Yes.
<s> And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
<s> Large resources, Starling, which I prefer to devote elsewhere....
<s> Isn't it funny?  You can look on my face  which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me.  Which shows  a Strength which <u>must</u> come from strong  strong convictions.   But you <u>shy</u> when I say the name of God.

<s> Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
<s> I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed. 
<s> I said she's been missing for-

<s> Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.
<s> No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold.

<s> It's perfect.
<s> Where's my wife?
<s> For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.
<s> Thanks.
<s> I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
<s> You probably don't remember the night we played. Your first year as husband and wife.
<s> All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you're describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?
<s> The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?
<s> Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
<s> YOU!
<s> I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
<s> In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
<s> Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
<s> I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!
<s> He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
<s> It's November.
<s> I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
<s> Spanish kinda guys!
<s> I'm not gonna throw you out, Bernie.
<s> I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern.  A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being.
<s> YOU KNOW WHY?  BECAUSE IT'LL BE AN <u>EXCUSE</u>!  IT'LL BE "BERNIE LAPLANTE EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIX."  NO, FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE.  THAT'S HOW MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY. I HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE.

<s> In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness.  He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car.  It was just an impulse, stealing my purse.
<s> I'm going to apologize to Bubber?
<s> Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
<s> What picture?
<s> Yes.
<s> It's been sometime since, uh, I received any, uh, of that kind of, uh... attention.  A couple of... years.
<s> A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...
<s> John, I know all about it.
<s> This sofa is a lethal weapon.  The springs... are... the springs... what...?
<s> Because he was a <u>real</u> hero, Chucky. He was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing.  He didn't expect the media to lionize him.  He didn't expect a million dollar reward. He saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when "good sense" told him otherwise. He was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to LaPlante....  For how much, LaPlante?  A couple of bucks?  Did you give him enough for a decent meal?
<s> He'll do it.  You really-should have talked to him first.
<s> You wouldn't push the guy, would you?
<s> What's "cynical"?
<s> Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
<s> Reporters... have to... rise above their hormones.
<s> Whoa, check it out.
<s> You're responsible for your own actions and you don't mean to hurt anyone.  In other words, you've done <u>your</u> best.  I'm saying don't carry the burden of <u>other</u> people's actions on your shoulders, because they're beyond your control.
<s> Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
<s> I understand that.
<s> You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
<s> I <u>know</u>.  I just feel that the relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little thing could wreck the careful groundwork I've laid up till now.
<s> Bye, Neil!
<s> Well, what do you want me to do, Rita -- I can't just forget fifteen years of marriage.  Well, of course I know <u>you</u> can.  No, Rita, I -- what was that?  -- oh, I thought I heard something on the line.
<s> The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
<s> No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
<s> He's staying with a friend.  Hurry up now, you'll be late for school.
<s> What?
<s> It'll be even shorter if I get that new job.  Come on.
<s> Damn.
<s> What?
<s> I know someone else who's sensitive.
<s> I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
<s> Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
<s> Fuck you, Philip.
<s> Oh baby.
<s> I'm <u>fired</u>.  I'm unemployed.  Is that your idea of negotiating from a position of strength?  Clearly any potential employers have been warned to back off!
<s> I'm having the floor fixed,
<s> That's not a decision for you to make on your own.
<s> Not very long.  There have been a couple of bids already.
<s> Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
<s> Oh, space!  -- You said the right thing.
<s> I didn't.
<s> Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
<s> No.
<s> No joke, Lieutenant.
<s> Parker.  We found him knocked out in the can.
<s> Not now.  I'm busy.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yeah -- how'd you know that?
<s> Really?  I want to make sure that I understand what you're telling me, Greley.  A crime was committed in New York City?  That is news.
<s> Lieutenant.
<s> No.
<s> There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
<s> It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
<s> Living.  Remember?
<s> I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
<s> Can you really tell from doing that?
<s> I lied.
<s> Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
<s> I cannot explain.
<s> What are you hoping to find inside?
<s> I'll be fine.
<s> You look like you have.
<s> Why?
<s> No.
<s> If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
<s> It will end tonight.
<s> Get out.
<s> We'll see.
<s> I do not know -- and even if I did...
<s> I know.
<s> No.
<s> No -- I'm fine.  Thank you.
<s> You also have a power, Conner.  It is why you have survived.
<s> Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
<s> The best.
<s> I'll make the call.
<s> You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
<s> Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
<s> Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?
<s> That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us.
<s> How about the cop?
<s> I got these people!  You try to come get me, I'll kill every fuckin' one of them!
<s> The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
<s> We can't forget it.  The Sheriffs think you won't let me talk to Smith because he's dead.  They think you murdered him.
<s> Only if you try to grab me.  We could've shot you from the wall.
<s> They'll cut the power.
<s> Dennis.
<s> I like it here, Dennis.  I'm never going to leave.
<s> Okey-doke.
<s> I don't eat junk food.
<s> You fucked up, Glen.
<s> Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
<s> I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it.
<s> We'll see you in a couple of hours.
<s> We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
<s> We're hungry.  You're going to cook.
<s> I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
<s> Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal pupilation.  He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
<s> Just one question.  Please.
<s> Another minute.  Please --
<s> What's that, Chief?  Say again.
<s> Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
<s> Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
<s> I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you, then I don't want you to do it, okay?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Try Al.  See if you can open Al.
<s> Who is it?
<s> What do you want?
<s> I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> FBI, you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've got <u>Smith</u>!  <u>I've got Smith</u>!!
<s> I don't have that much.
<s> And four children?
<s> That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
<s> It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
<s> As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
<s> “Well rewarded” Those were his words.
<s> Get in.
<s> I am on a list! What list?
<s> I will do nothing unless you help me now.
<s> Business is good at the hotel?
<s> I am always glad to see you Paul.
<s> At least.
<s> You have no whiskey?
<s> What is it?
<s> Good. I'd like to book a massage.
<s> Thank God.
<s> This goes out live?
<s> Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a fucking aeroplane.
<s> The guest list. It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president.
<s> That will take time.
<s> Call, sir?
<s> Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
<s> I will give you my house.
<s> Of course.
<s> Of course.
<s> They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
<s> No, Odette says he's in shock.
<s> What about us?
<s> Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
<s> No! Sit down now.
<s> What sort of plan?
<s> What's wrong?
<s> There is one thing I need right away.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.
<s> The staff, the guests.
<s> Paul, do everything you can to buy time. I will call you back.
<s> Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
<s> -- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
<s> But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
<s> A very, very scary game. But then look at the bright side: if there's only one of you still upright at dawn, you'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket.
<s> Ms. Marr!
<s> You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!
<s> A cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- I think the power of the house fades at dawn.
<s> The...Fourth of July.
<s> -- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop.
<s> -- listen to the man --
<s> Wait a minute... What are you saying?
<s> How'd you make your guest list, Price: throw darts at a phone book?
<s> You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
<s> Oh, I think we're going to have several.
<s> Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The "O.J." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your "Jim Jones Kool- Aid" that was exactly that?
<s> Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
<s> -- the sadistic prick --
<s> If I had one, Evelyn, I think you know who'd be first and last --
<s> No. OhmyGod, Pritchett was right -- The house <u><b>IS</b></u> haunted.
<s> My wife. Where were we?
<s> I've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it, everything's fine.
<s> Maybe if I --
<s> What?
<s> I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as "ghosts." This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --
<s> Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
<s> -- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
<s> What's the matter?
<s> I did a cross search, death certificates with this address. James and Marion Foster.  They had a daughter.  Right here, it says James died, 1882, pneumonia. Marion dies September the next year. Suicide.
<s> What was her name?
<s> What will they tell you?
<s> A few years older, perhaps.
<s> Good-bye.
<s> Well I bet you they're happy.
<s> Ok...
<s> It's dark!  I can't breathe!
<s> I don't know.  That's strange.
<s> She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
<s> Ok.
<s> Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
<s> What about keeping an open mind?
<s> We're not going.
<s> Well that's what we're here for. I mean -
<s> We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.

<s> You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...
<s> And what did you discover?
<s> I don't know ...

<s> Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
<s> Sorry.
<s> That's great.
<s> No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?

<s> And he still sits there?
<s> Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
<s> That you found.  What do you mean you found it?
<s> Help me pick 'em up, Terri.  I think the lady just made a sale.
<s> Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
<s> No.  Really?
<s> I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
<s> But how in God's name ...

<s> Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?

<s> C'mon.  It'll be great.
<s> Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
<s> Gum.
<s> Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable...  Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.
<s> Don't say it, Hawkins.  I'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure.

<s> What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.

<s> You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
<s> Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it...

<s> Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that Idea Man story!
<s> Says who?!
<s> I'm sure you do.
<s> What the heck they doin'?
<s> ...Geez.
<s> Well, I --
<s> But, buddy, you were --
<s> Get up!
<s> Yeah?
<s> It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --
<s> Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily it would just be a nuisance. But it seems -- well, there was a spy in the company...
<s> She looks in her purse...
<s> Plan two: Here come the waterworks.
<s> He notices.
<s> ...Her mother needs an operation...
<s> No, Bennie: Lumbago.
<s> He don't look wise.
<s> Alive?
<s> But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
<s> I'm afraid so.
<s> Try it -- you may have more influence than you think.
<s> I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been "mindless"...
<s> I asked you to let me explain. It's a long story.  And not an easy one --
<s> Thank you.
<s> No, this is quite final.  You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter.  He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies.
<s> I like her already.
<s> I went to school in Buffalo.  Paul went to school in England.
<s> I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
<s> Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
<s> Yes.  But it was once the figurehead of a slave ship.  That's where our people came from -- from the misery and pain of slavery. For generations they found life a burden. That's why they still weep when a child is born -- and make merry at a burial.
<s> If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
<s> And charming?
<s> Good morning.
<s> Well, I had a good time up to a point.
<s> Why did you come in here?
<s> I imagined this so differently...
<s> I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.
<s> I want you to be safe, Betsy.  I want to know you're away from this place -- home again, where nothing can harm you -- nothing and no one.
<s> Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness.  And, of course, the events which led up to it.
<s> To the asylum?
<s> It doesn't matter what you call it. I can tell you right now Jessica isn't going!
<s> And as usual no one believed me...
<s> Good night.
<s> I do. I'm -- are you...?
<s> You know Elena, I've been thinking--
<s> In the car.
<s> I know, I know. I had no idea --
<s> I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home.
<s> Elena.
<s> The phone's out.
<s> Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.
<s> Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.
<s> Damn right, but where the hell were you?
<s> Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --
<s> Nothing.
<s> Huh?
<s> -- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad?  You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice --
<s> Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
<s> Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
<s> My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. I've been married to him for 17 years and I don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what I'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, I'm proposing that you and I do what makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some time. That's all.
<s> I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and --
<s> Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.
<s> Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.
<s> It's really quite all right.
<s> I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
<s> But not too ashamed.
<s> I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  Take care.
<s> I gotta get to English class.
<s> Do what?
<s> You going to tell dad?
<s> Hey, it's a sellable skill.
<s> Out.
<s> Then why'd you come after me?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
<s> Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
<s> What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
<s> Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d.
<s> What are you doing?
<s> Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
<s> Wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here.
<s> Don't worry about him...
<s> Twelve years younger.
<s> I don't remember.
<s> About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
<s> Worth pursuing?
<s> No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
<s> That's right.
<s> Even the best make mistakes.
<s> Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
<s> What is it?
<s> Huh?
<s> She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
<s> The other guy?
<s> You don't know.
<s> Long as it's fun.
<s> Thought you wanted something fun...
<s> That's what I said.
<s> What was?
<s> The phone call.  The knapsack.
<s> Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes, and very beautiful.
<s> They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed.
<s> You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
<s> He knew nothing. He just didn't care.
<s> If you say so. You are innocent.
<s> I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
<s> It's already begun. If you want to save her, send her away.
<s> Louis, I swear I did not.
<s> Yes, cherie, of course you want more. And I'll show you how to get it. You drink from morals, my beauty, but from me? Never again.
<s> What night? What do you mean?
<s> Stop her Louis!
<s> I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
<s> The way I learn everything. By watching you.
<s> He jests.
<s> Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book.
<s> Tell me you don't hate me Louis. I did it for you -
<s> Not yet.
<s> Still my beautiful child.
<s> You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
<s> Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
<s> How devilishly clever.
<s> No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
<s> You have fed. You were made for this...
<s> Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
<s> I know. Let her alone.
<s> In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it to you.
<s> No...
<s> What are you saying?
<s> Lestat, what do you mean?
<s> Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
<s> Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
<s> Phones went down a few minutes ago.
<s> I should go up there. I should call her back, tell her I'm coming.
<s> Nope. I told him that you absolutely, positively would not be here at this bar between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock tonight. And then he came anyway.
<s> Hey, sorry...  He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste.
<s> No, I'm the King of the World.
<s> Karla! You promised.
<s> He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
<s> Don't even think about it.
<s> The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.
<s> Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth.
<s> Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
<s> No, you're not.
<s> Why are you being like this?
<s> Can't what?
<s> It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.  It just isn't.
<s> No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
<s> This weekend?
<s> Who?
<s> I'm fine.
<s> It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
<s> To get out of Southport?
<s> I'm okay.
<s> Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes.
<s> Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
<s> We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right.
<s> I'll talk real slow.
<s> They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.  Am I right, sister?
<s> Why?
<s> Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care.
<s> We gotta get out of here. Now.
<s> He's probably the only one who can help us.
<s> Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
<s> Okay, Karla, five seconds.  Five...Four...
<s> Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
<s> Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
<s> The rest of us see bathrobes.
<s> Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
<s> How's the water?
<s> Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on here?
<s> Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
<s> What is up with that weirdo?
<s> How clover you are, Mr. Albrecht, to see all that in our simple Thea... She is quite pretty, isn't she?
<s> Why don't you stay here tonight? Get a good sleep. You can return to your command in the morning.
<s> Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
<s> Very well. I'll wager a dinner.
<s> No.  She shall not be left here.
<s> On my word! That's what they believe.
<s> She has never mentioned her family.
<s> Thea is an orphan.
<s> Really, this is idiotic!
<s> I don't understand you.
<s> Why -- no not before Thea came ——
<s> Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
<s> But the war, the army —— they need you.
<s> How did she die?
<s> No -- you musn't. He thinks I've bewitched you. He won't believe it —- he'll hate me even more! My only chance is to stay away from him.
<s> Are you running a business or a charity ward?
<s> Bert! Thank heaven you're here!
<s> What are you, a mind reader or something?
<s> Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
<s> Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
<s> No wonder you jumped in the river.
<s> There is no George Bailey. You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy . . . 
<s> Well, naturally. Of course.
<s> No!
<s> You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
<s> What's that book you've got there?
<s> Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
<s> All right.
<s> Of course it's the place.
<s> When'd you see him last?
<s> Give the flower a drink.
<s> I'm not rubbing it in. Well, I guess we better run along.
<s> I'm working across on a cattle boat.
<s> Oh –– Welch. That's what I get for praying.
<s> I'm all right.
<s> Oh, stop that grunting.
<s> Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Maybe you were born older, George.
<s> I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college.
<s> Very funny. Very funny.
<s> How do you do.
<s> Yeah . . .  . . . you can take this one off now.
<s> You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. Now, I say . . .
<s> All right, sir.
<s> What is it –– a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
<s> They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
<s> Beautiful.
<s> I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
<s> Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
<s> I'm going to scream!
<s> Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know . . . I guess I was homesick.
<s> Don't you like her?
<s> Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.
<s> George, darling! Where have you been?
<s> With the right wind, 15-20 knots.
<s> Well, I don't know....
<s> Stop paddling!
<s> Swim for it!
<s> We'll take your supercargo.
<s> Sean!  Catch it!
<s> Let's just go sailing, okay?
<s> Anyone got another set of sails?
<s> Happy to do it.
<s> Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
<s> If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
<s> What camera?
<s> Hey -- you can't do that.
<s> Look, humor the old man -- just be careful.
<s> You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
<s> Look -- I just got this from Phil Fogarty.  It was in the camera belonging to the missing divers. It proves I was right, all along.
<s> Is that what it is?
<s> Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
<s> After we've looked, we'll talk.
<s> You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?
<s> Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
<s> Just one minute....
<s> Mike's out there.
<s> We have to do something.
<s> Two of them are still missing!
<s> Go ahead, whatever it's worth.
<s> 10-4, in a few minutes.  He's down checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.
<s> No.  Find your brother, okay?
<s> Great.
<s> Help!  Help!
<s> That's a crock of shit.
<s> Name it.
<s> I'm not in the way.  Andy, am I in the way?
<s> So?  So?
<s> Don't forget you have your brother.
<s> I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
<s> Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
<s> That's a lot of ground to cover.
<s> ... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
<s> Okay, stay.  We'll come back for you.
<s> Are you coming...?
<s> Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
<s> It's easier to lure sharks at night.
<s> Me, too.
<s> What's up?
<s> Sure.  Let's go.
<s> I can't take water, Kathryn.
<s> I can't!  My dad had it, and I don't know if you can inherit it or what, but I got it, and I hate it.  I can't stand it!
<s> I want that shark, Kathryn.
<s> Fine.  Have them do some.
<s> Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
<s> She, Mister Hutton.
<s> And big for his age.
<s> Sure.
<s> Depends on big brother.
<s> Come on!  Check this out!
<s> Why you sonuvabitch...
<s> No, Kelly, I don't want to...
<s> Can hardly wait to do it again.
<s> Hold still, damn it!
<s> Remember, skiers stay up longer.
<s> It's disappeared.
<s> Polar bears in Georgia???
<s> It's large enough...
<s> No way.
<s> Great.  I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.
<s> This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
<s> Absolutely.  The audience will stain their drawers.  I did.
<s> He was doing his job....
<s> My mother always told me, if God had intended us to ride parachutes for fun, we'd have been born with free tickets....
<s> Tell Matt he should be here....
<s> Because....
<s> I can't help it....
<s> Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
<s> I don't know what he thinks...I don't know what I think...I don't even know why I'm talking about it...  It's silly...I'm getting too old for this sort of thing....
<s> You have something to say about everything....
<s> We'll divert it...We'll do something....
<s> Stop what?
<s> I'm hungry, Mom....
<s> Hello?  Thea who?  I know it's Thea Brody.  How many grandchildren do I have?  I know you can use the phone by yourself. You're a big girl.  I know you're five.
<s> A small one...Your brother won't be here....
<s> Mom, please don't start that again....
<s> I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
<s> I have to get this finished.
<s> No.
<s> I'm going to finish what Jake and I started.  I owe him that.  Hell, I owe him everything....  I'll get something important done for both of us....
<s> Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
<s> It could have been an accident....
<s> Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
<s> It's wonderful....
<s> There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
<s> Why?
<s> I'm the artist.  Like my mother.
<s> The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.
<s> Nothing!  What the hell are you doing down there?
<s> Still chasing fish?
<s> Oh, boy....
<s> If we had some decent money, I'd be able to read their temperatures... Study their motor systems....
<s> It's not a bad life, Jake....
<s> You're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics.  You're never going to amount to anything.
<s> We got it together, Jake....
<s> My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
<s> So did I....
<s> Hoagie.
<s> What do you know about him?
<s> Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
<s> Maybe he only likes white meat....
<s> Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
<s> If we're real lucky, it'll eat itself....
<s> The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....
<s> We need it to eat electronics, man ...Not you.  Get it on me....
<s> In a few minutes....
<s> I told you....
<s> When he has a pillow over his head....
<s> Good night, Polly....
<s> Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
<s> What d'you mean, I just opened it for you? This is <u>French</u> champagne.
<s> Not too good in daylight ..
<s> I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
<s> A dollar? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar ..
<s> Listen to me saying what?
<s> I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? "Good-bye, Princess," & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro?
<s> Don't give me that! <u>Not another</u> <u>word</u>! When you had the Fat Lady in there, and I asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said <u>yes</u>. So as far as I was concerned, <u>she's ly-</u> <u>ing</u>. And if the King of fucking England had walked in & told me different, I wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because <u>you</u> told me ..
<s> I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
<s> I'm going up to the institute.
<s> Hey ..
<s> <u>Hit those wipers, Ross</u>.
<s> I don't see that at all ..
<s> I thought it was Taylor's case?
<s> No, Sir.
<s> Once.
<s> Fucken noddle's hanging off ..
<s> Average rainfall, 48 inches. Pisses down, October to June.
<s> Wrong cabinet.
<s> I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
<s> No.
<s> No problem. I'm not in a hurry.
<s> Hamlet. Have you read it?
<s> I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that.
<s> Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
<s> You said, you were in the bad lands?
<s> .. sorry your father, mother sis- ter, whatever .. I couldn't take another day of it .. Come on, I'm gonna rob you of a cup of coffee ..
<s> I know.
<s> Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
<s> I'm going back to the institute.
<s> I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
<s> I wanna be near you ...
<s> C'mon, Chief, if it's sensitive, tell me .. I'm not taking notes ..
<s> Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..
<s> No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.
<s> And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
<s> Could you just stop moving?
<s> Bill, Rod, wait --
<s> Hmm.  Pretty good.
<s> No no. I knew.
<s> You think so?
<s> My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said "you complete me." _ 40.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> Hello?
<s> Thanks.
<s> Good idea.  Thank you.
<s> Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
<s> Same to you.
<s> Fine, I just --
<s> Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
<s> Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
<s> Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
<s> Of course, medical! _ 42.
<s> If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
<s> At eleven at night? _ 70.
<s> Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
<s> But you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
<s> Ten seconds, Rod.
<s> It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
<s> Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
<s> Huh?
<s> Another drink please.
<s> Oh my God.
<s> But how did you get "kwan?" _ 82.
<s> You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you.
<s> Good deal, man.
<s> Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
<s> We still having dinner in L.A.?
<s> Go.  Flee.
<s> How sad --
<s> Not a chance.
<s> And say what?  "Please remove your dick from my ass?!"
<s> What are you talking about -- "don't get emotional." If you ask me, you haven't gotten emotional ENOUGH about this man. _ 98.
<s> I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --
<s> The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
<s> I came here to let you go. _ 27.
<s> Came here to fire you, Jerry.
<s> Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
<s> So do you.
<s> Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...
<s> Oh, don't worry about that.
<s> Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men, we stick around, huh?
<s> Just hold on.
<s> I didn't know, there were two islands.
<s> Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
<s> It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
<s> No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
<s> It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
<s> I don't remember that on InGen's list.
<s> The last of my breed.
<s> A well-accepted theory.
<s> Then we go home?
<s> No. I couldn't see.
<s> No we're not.
<s> Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
<s> Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
<s> But you never came across just one.
<s> It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.
<s> Minimal.
<s> Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
<s> After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.
<s> Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
<s> Kelly!  What are you doing here?
<s> I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
<s> Where does it say that?
<s> I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
<s> I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
<s> Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
<s> You've broken its leg!
<s> The velociraptors.
<s> It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.
<s> It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--
<s> Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch.
<s> Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp right away.  Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so.
<s> No!  Get in the car before they hear us!
<s> Four, counting the one in the chamber.
<s> That's a scientific impossibility, you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Whatever you study, you also change.
<s> Funded by whom?
<s> You think this is all a joke?
<s> Damn!
<s> What now?
<s> I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
<s> That's pharmacological.  From local plant life.
<s> I'll catch up with you.  You can go with the others.
<s> Come along.  I know my way around a kitchen.  Come along.
<s> Yes.  Good shape, too.  Five, six feet high.  I'm guessing nine feet long.  Look at the - -
<s> They smell.
<s> Not just every six weeks.
<s> - - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
<s> You can't hold it by yourself!
<s> They're not here.
<s> We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.  You just take me through this step by step.  I'm on channel two.
<s> The shutdown must have turned off all the fences. Goddamn it! Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence.
<s> And scary.
<s> Yeah.
<s> That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  John's plan. 
<s> I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
<s> Tim, are you okay?
<s> That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.
<s> This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
<s> It's so strong!  Look at its nose.  Need help?
<s> Machines hate you?
<s> I didn't say I was scared.
<s> Alan Grant.  Tell me, what kind of metabolism do they have?  What's their growth rate?  rate of growth.
<s> Let's get you out.
<s> Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
<s> Dorkatops!
<s> It's okay!  It's okay!  It's a brachiosaur!
<s> Okay.  Keep low.  Follow me.
<s> Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!
<s> I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
<s> There's no sign of him anywhere.
<s> Excellent.
<s> I'm afraid I am gonna fall!
<s> Fifty? We need seventy-five.
<s> You want to put in chain saws?
<s> And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
<s> Yeah?
<s> You learn something new every day. Let's go.
<s> Who is this? What's going on?
<s> Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
<s> Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
<s> So?
<s> There's a pizza place over on Market.
<s> Not yet.
<s> How's that possible?
<s> My client... is dead.  But I think he's a free man.
<s> Even the so-called New Town isn't so new.  Only the people.  People of the future living in buildings of the past.  Has anyone seen Eduard?
<s> What was the matter with it?
<s> I don't know what you could have read.
<s> I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
<s> A man must eat --  And drink.
<s> There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
<s> Not a chance.  I'm the thinnest person I know.
<s> Yes.
<s> I gave it to him yesterday.
<s> Yes.
<s> One of you must be mistaken.
<s> And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
<s> At the cost of others?  You accuse people of murder without trial -- apparently without irony.  Did you go to the Castle with Eduard?  Then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all -- even before or after he got there.
<s> He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
<s> I've heard of it happening.
<s> No, we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off, as usual, toward his house.
<s> -- Accident and Compensation Association.
<s> Yes.  Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends.  How was Eduard ...
<s> -- Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant.
<s> We saw her naked once -- didn't we.
<s> It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being.
<s> What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
<s> Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
<s> We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
<s> My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.
<s> They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us.
<s> Does this look like the "Queen Mary"?? We don't take passengers! Full steam ahead, Captain Engelhorn!
<s> Now Ann ...
<s> Father ... Father!
<s> You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!
<s> No!
<s> I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
<s> Relax ... it was fifteen years ago. I don't do it now.
<s> Ann ... you're father is dead. You have nothing to prove anymore.
<s> It' s alright Jack ... it' s alright.
<s> They' re dead.
<s> Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.
<s> Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!
<s> How about Ann? Is she going with you?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Compassion.
<s> Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall --  -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --
<s> And Cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly --
<s> Well we're pretty --
<s> No, that's not --
<s> Like for you to look for the man.
<s> -- Yes.
<s> He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
<s> But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.
<s> Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
<s> OK.
<s> Tell me about Frank Ligourin.
<s> I go on rounds.
<s> It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
<s> No, I said what did you think.
<s> Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know --  -- too bad? Pathetic?
<s> It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof.
<s> What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
<s> I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
<s> Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
<s> You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!
<s> Right back at the start, right?
<s> I don't think so.
<s> Well there's a couple --
<s> Well as a matter of --
<s> Yeah, two things Pete, that --
<s> What's in it?
<s> It's in the report.
<s> All right.
<s> I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
<s> Did she talk about him to you?
<s> I looked it up.
<s> No sir, we don't state that. We're countin --
<s> He's in his room, playing.
<s> The prospect of losing my child.
<s> Do you like to be with your mommy?
<s> Welcome to the... 
<s> Show...
<s> Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
<s> Uh huh...
<s> That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
<s> No.  This is fine.  Just take a bite, you'll like it fine.
<s> Some of the brown stuff is still there.
<s> Oh...
<s> It's okay, son...I'm here... Just a little more to go... Don't worry, son...I'm here...
<s> Sure.  Lots of times.
<s> No.
<s> Will you come and say good-night to me every night?
<s> Sustained.
<s> Mr. Kramer, isn't it true that you were fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago?
<s> No, I did not.
<s> I make thirty-one thousand dollars a year.
<s> Your honor, I'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at?  Mrs. Kramer, were you a failure at the longest, most important personal relationship in your life?
<s> Can you recall any particular incident that relates to Mr. Kramer's care of his child?
<s> Your honor, I'm only examining the man's employment record.  He pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job.
<s> Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson.  Set up an appointment at four.
<s> Either you call and set up the appointment, or I'll call.  And if I call, you lose the commission.
<s> I...I don't know...
<s> C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that.  You're a terrific mother--
<s> You want what?!
<s> Joanna, I don't give a--
<s> Jim, I've got to go.  I'm already late--
<s> Yes, what?
<s> Kramer...
<s> Kramer--
<s> But it's not a year from now, is it?
<s> Fine.
<s> Six.
<s> We can appeal, but I can't guarantee anything.
<s> It's beautiful.  It's just beautiful. They have a beautiful relationship.
<s> Oh, Christ.. .John, there's some- thing I ought to tell you.  My... ah, situation has...changed.  I lost my job.
<s> No.
<s> Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay.  But I'll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did.
<s> No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
<s> Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.
<s> You and Charley?
<s> Kham, Holiness.
<s> Khambas are wild men.
<s> General Chiang.
<s> You could buy them.
<s> You are the man who wrote this letter. You are the man who has come back to lead us. You will soon have great responsibilities. You must know what to do.
<s> Can India help us?
<s> Where is that?
<s> Tibet, at war? No. China is close, America is far away. After countless people die, China would still, always, be close. We will work with what we have.
<s> I had relinquished doubt.
<s> The Khamba's gun is his most prized possession. I admire them so. They face a modern, well equipped army, and still, they fight.
<s> I will not go.
<s> Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
<s> Is that a true story, or pretend?
<s> Pretend.
<s> You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
<s> The Chinese.
<s> We cannot.
<s> It is possible, Holiness.
<s> The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad.
<s> Too young?
<s> Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart.
<s> If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source.
<s> Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
<s> Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
<s> No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
<s> You don't want to cut me down. 'Cause I'll kill you.
<s> Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.
<s> Jack.  We've all seen it.  He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant.
<s> You do?
<s> Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
<s> Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
<s> You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
<s> No.
<s> Could we have intercourse?
<s> So I don't like tents, why--
<s> What?
<s> I'd be able to see something.
<s> I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
<s> You <u>did</u>, you--
<s> Keep it dry.  No swimming.
<s> Ssssh!
<s> Maybe.  Don't mush it.
<s> He heeds a tourniquet.
<s> Yeah.
<s> But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.
<s> Good thinking.
<s> So does he.
<s> I'm fine, thank you.
<s> Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
<s> Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker. 
<s> <u>Apologize</u>?
<s> I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
<s> I don't know.  It was like a tug. Something tugged us.
<s> I think.  My hair.  Where's Hector?!  Where is he?
<s> Yes.
<s> Look.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> A jerk.
<s> Kelly--
<s> It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
<s> Backstabber?
<s> The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...
<s> The market in Lecter hints is way down, today, okay? I've got two good men dead in Memphis, and three civilians. I've got -
<s> Thanks.
<s> Yes sir.
<s> He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.
<s> Like I have a "knack" for Dr. Lecter?
<s> Well, she's not local. Her ears are pierced three times each, and she's wearing green glitter nail polish. Looks like town to me...
<s> Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again. There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip.
<s> Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me.
<s> Sometimes you do.
<s> We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
<s> He said - "I can smell your cunt."
<s> Yes.
<s> Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?
<s> Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
<s> And you'd hate to think you were common. My, wouldn't that sting! Well you're far from common, Officer Starling. All you have is the fear of it.  Now please excuse me. Good day.
<s> Then please - do this test for me.
<s> If you didn't kill him, then who did?
<s> Because you weren't wasting my time.
<s> Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him, all those years ago...? That's impossible.
<s> That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort?  Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?
<s> I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.
<s> The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see. Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one...
<s> The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.
<s> Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
<s> Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
<s> Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs... outside...
<s> Yes...! They were screaming.
<s> I don't know. I had no food or water. It was very cold. I thought - if I can even save just one... but he got so heavy. So heavy...
<s> Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall.
<s> Let us go, miss.
<s> Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
<s> Sorry to disappoint you...
<s> Because what I am interested in is right here...
<s> ...never doubt what you are doing.
<s> Alice?
<s> Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
<s> When? How?
<s> Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
<s> Dark haired...
<s> No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
<s> That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
<s> Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
<s> By your leave, sir.
<s> Terrible feature of war in the Americas.  Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.
<s> And who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon England's policies in her own colonies? To come and go without so much as a "by your leave."
<s> I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
<s> Magua say: "Yes. Good idea."
<s> Shit...
<s> There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
<s> Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
<s> I can't see them!
<s> Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
<s> Mr. Beck, the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of---
<s> And it killed Bo?
<s> Sounds like a good week, Beck. In fact...I put your folder in front of the Vice President of District Operations last night...
<s> Do it.
<s> It shouldn't be a long delay.
<s> I signed-up for the stock option.
<s> It wouldn't make any difference in there...He could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him!
<s> The man is unbelievable... I say, leave him in there.
<s> I'm on the way to the looney bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes.
<s> Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?...
<s> Twelve hours!
<s> What are you going to do to him?
<s> Like a leech.
<s> Jameson?  Who're you trying to con?
<s> Fucking great...You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
<s> She's wondering what's happening.  We're losing air faster than I thought.
<s> He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.
<s> I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?
<s> I'll think of something, don't worry.
<s> It's happening tomorrow morning. Get back here now.
<s> Apart from those shotguns.
<s> Like antiques.
<s> You get the guns?
<s> No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.
<s> Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
<s> Chris.  You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?
<s> Can I help?
<s> No Harry, you can't.
<s> It looks like ít, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
<s> Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
<s> All right, Kenny.
<s> It just cost me fifty quid to have this done.  If you think I am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're mistaken, Kenny.
<s> Furry muff, let's go.
<s> Poofs. Nothing heavy, four public school guys. Soft as shite.
<s> What the fuck is going on?
<s> I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.
<s> Why, what's up?
<s> A hundred grand.
<s> No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
<s> It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
<s> Doesn't sound very good to me.
<s> I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
<s> At what, exactly?
<s> Six.
<s> Er, well, twelve.
<s> How the fuck should I know?
<s> I'm not talking to you. You don't have any friends.
<s> I can't take any more school.
<s> They stole our land--
<s> You think I can't learn that?
<s> I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.
<s> No, sir. They all been real straight with me.
<s> I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There wasn't anything I could do. Shadow gets crazy--
<s> Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
<s> Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.
<s> Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
<s> No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
<s> If it's too late--
<s> Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and  all?
<s> He never asked her.
<s> No sir.
<s> So they stayed in Florida?
<s> By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.
<s> You lived in the States for a while?
<s> Lead mine.
<s> I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
<s> It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--
<s> You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
<s> Yeah?
<s> She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
<s> I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
<s> I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it?
<s> Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. Free admission.
<s> That's where he fell.
<s> It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
<s> If I thought it would help I'd put up a sign telling them not to. Right under the one about the employees washing their hands.
<s> And people make their choice--

<s> We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
<s> Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
<s> There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
<s> Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.
<s> I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
<s> Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
<s> The Perdido thing?
<s> Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
<s> Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?
<s> I felt that you could do better for yourself--
<s> That's me.
<s> Of course you can.
<s> I only went for my last two years.
<s> I can't name anybody she does like these days.
<s> A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
<s> They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
<s> He hates me.
<s> You've got your mother, your kids--
<s> I came back 'cause you were here.
<s> I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
<s> More, I hope.
<s> Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.
<s> The shooter local?
<s> They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
<s> Don't know if I'll still want it.
<s> Yeah. It's quiet--
<s> Hell of a spot to put a business.
<s> He's gonna find out.
<s> You heard right.
<s> doorway) And who's that?
<s> Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
<s> I'm out of here, man!  Are you coming?
<s> Hey, anytime.  Actually, no.  This was enough.
<s> All right.  It was...
<s> I know him.  I saw him.
<s> It's him... it's him.
<s> I don't know where you'd start.
<s> It was more than that, I think.

<s> For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
<s> I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
<s> So could you walk on water?
<s> Are you a gambling man?
<s> I don't think the dead much care.
<s> Are you a believer, then?
<s> Yes.  It's regrettable
<s> Shit...
<s> Sure.  Vivovich.
<s> Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
<s> Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
<s> It's me betrayed him.
<s> No.
<s> Yes.
<s> I don't know.
<s> There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
<s> A couple of weeks.
<s> He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with.
<s> I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me.
<s> Fuck you.
<s> No!
<s> These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
<s> Oh.
<s> Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
<s> No way.
<s> But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
<s> I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
<s> Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
<s> It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
<s> Where'd you grow up?
<s> I know, but that's what you like about me.
<s> Working.
<s> Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
<s> Yes?
<s> I don't think so.
<s> Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
<s> Do you want to- 
<s> Ok.
<s> One moment, please.
<s> Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.
<s> I went to a temple today and I didn't feel anything.
<s> Ok, I will... later.
<s> We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
<s> ...Well, I have the worst  headache, I have to go find some aspirin. But, call me, let's have a drink, I'm under Evelyn Waugh.
<s> Hmmm.
<s> No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.
<s> Well, it's a nice surprise.  Should I hit the "stop" button?
<s> I can't believe Will killed him.
<s> Claire...
<s> Must be a spare set.
<s> Frustrating.  Form over content. Everything's so retro.
<s> Yes.  It's exactly...
<s> Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
<s> My secretary?
<s> This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
<s> I hope so.
<s> It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
<s> Yes.  We won, that's right.
<s> Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
<s> I murdered my parents, Mr. Kelson.  And while they deserved it, I still went to confession the following Sunday.
<s> If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
<s> There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
<s> So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
<s> Townsend, he had some of Father's books.
<s> The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out.
<s> What?
<s> I don't know.  Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment.
<s> I was desperate.  I knew you wrote about murders.  I needed a way in.
<s> I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
<s> You have to be experienced to do this. Just wait outside. Otherwise, you risk killing him.
<s> And what's that mean?
<s> I know who he is.
<s> I'll explain everything later.  Can you meet me tonight?
<s> Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?
<s> I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
<s> I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
<s> There weren't any voices.
<s> As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
<s> Of course.
<s> So you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game.
<s> His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
<s> Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
<s> Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
<s> I don't remember that.
<s> The blue.
<s> Thanks, sweetheart.
<s> But you use potato?
<s> What'd you do?
<s> You're cold?
<s> Huh?
<s> Gotta wait til the press conference.
<s> Get used to it, babe.
<s> Why not?
<s> No one's forcing her.
<s> Oh, great.
<s> And what am I supposed to say to the man?
<s> Chances are there's still a chance.
<s> That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
<s> Man, forget you then, stupid.
<s> I don't.
<s> You either.
<s> Fine, Quincy.
<s> I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
<s> What?
<s> Quincy...
<s> What's up?
<s> It happens, right...
<s> Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this meeting with this guy.
<s> The "man" again.
<s> Are you out of your mind?
<s> I decided to go pro.  And who knows where I'll end up, you know?
<s> No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> A rest?
<s> No.
<s> Thanks.
<s> It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
<s> So you're gonna bitch up?
<s> If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present.
<s> What are you doing in my room?
<s> We were just studying.
<s> Yup.
<s> What?
<s> I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.
<s> Your door was unlocked.
<s> I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
<s> Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
<s> Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
<s> Oral surgery.  Corrective teeth surgery.
<s> I need corrective oral surgery. I need the braces.
<s> I can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation I'm in, I don't -- Avi: You know what?  Being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? Now Solomon, let me just ask you once: Please. Please. Don't do this.
<s> These adults are tough enough, I think you'll be surprised -- the Mexican's a bit of a question mark --
<s> In my sleep, Burt.
<s> I'm really only equipped to take orders --
<s> It's me.  Claudia.  It's me.
<s> ...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --
<s> I don't want you to think that I'm that way to you -- I'm not gonna call you a slut or something --
<s> baby, please, please --
<s> YOU BURN IN BELL.  You burn in hell and you deserve it -- YOU GET THE FUCK OUT.
<s> Ok.  Claudia Wilson: You tryin' to go deaf?
<s> You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually?
<s> That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
<s> Good bye.
<s> I thought you were flirting with me a little.
<s> No, no.
<s> I'm sorry --
<s> Oh my god, Jim. Jim, that was so --
<s> Wanna kiss me, Jim?
<s> please, what is it, please --
<s> yeah, yes, hi, hello.
<s> Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom.
<s> NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.
<s> If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  We fucking had this game.
<s> No, Son...be quiet...be quiet now...
<s> We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
<s> I'm not mad, son, I will not be mad at you and it's ok and please put it down and I won't be mad and I won't --
<s> I was listening --
<s> Fine.  Phil, you still there?
<s> Might of been before my time.
<s> -- and lemme tell you this: Samuel Johnson never had his life shit on and taken from him and his money stolen -- who took his life and his money?  His parents? His mommy and daddy?  Make him live this life like this -- "A man of genius" gets shit on as a child and that scars and it hurts and have you ever been hit by lighting? It hurts and it doesn't happen to everyone, it's an electrical charge that finds it's way across the universe and lands in your body and your head -- and as for "ruined but by himself," not if his parents take his friggin' life and his money and tell you to do this and do that and if you don't? well, what --
<s> We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
<s> Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.
<s> She went out.  She said she went out to run some errands.  She'll be back.
<s> She loves you.
<s> Who?
<s> Is Jack your son?
<s> Hi.  Is Frank there?
<s> -- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?
<s> An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?
<s> I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.
<s> Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  They wouldn't --
<s> Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one more time: Is Anyone Else In This House Right Now?
<s> THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
<s> I need you to get me Paula --
<s> I was saying...thinking maybe I'd get my own quiz show someday, Jimmy. Just like you!
<s> I'm sorry, Stanley.
<s> As fast as I can.
<s> She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.
<s> Love you too..
<s> We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...
<s> Do you have any children with anyone?
<s> Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
<s> I don't know what I've done.
<s> I'm her father.
<s> Yeah.  She's sleeping now, I mean --
<s> I'II go....is it...back here?
<s> It's alright.
<s> No.
<s> No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
<s> If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
<s> -- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
<s> Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --
<s> I'm trying to help, Linda --
<s> Hang up the phone.
<s> ...I don't....
<s> Do you have that?
<s> That's it.
<s> We need more dog food --
<s> See you.
<s> I don't know.
<s> It's ok.
<s> Hi.
<s> Yes.
<s> Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan.
<s> He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
<s> You bring me the heart of the Jesuit General, and you will have a palace of your own.
<s> Well here is the problem at hand: the King has ordered me to discover the identity of the Governor General of Jesuits, and kill him.  As our English rivals have left the Catholic Church, Louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of Europe by uniting Church and State and making himself head of both.  He has already picked the Pope.  Only the Jesuits, who put God above throne or papacy, stand in his way.
<s> Making the key to the throne.
<s> There is that, of course -- but mainly it is because I am so much smarter than everyone else.
<s> But -- what is he doing?
<s> Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
<s> Hold your goblet with two fingers.
<s> I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
<s> I know.  God go with you.
<s> Catacombs.  Very holy.
<s> Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
<s> Come on...
<s> Who?
<s> None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
<s> Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.
<s> Athos, my friend!
<s> You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
<s> Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
<s> I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
<s> I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.
<s> D'Artagnan...
<s> Just... water.
<s> And you never knew why?
<s> I decided it this morning.
<s> Let us play a game, d'Artagnan, let us pretend I am King and you are Captain of my Musketeers.  Let us behave as if my wish is law.  And my wish is to enjoy this party!
<s> It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I --
<s> Yes, your Majesty.
<s> They have plotted against me!  Me! The embodiment of God's will!
<s> There.
<s> Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
<s> The corridor nullifies our number... And no one has stomach to fight the Captain.
<s> Shoot them!  Shoot them!
<s> Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
<s> Sire, I --
<s> Or worse, we'll have a hostage situation on our hands.
<s> You mean shut your ass down!
<s> He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
<s> Oh for Chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--
<s> Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
<s> These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
<s> Did you start out area six?
<s> Gotta come from somewhere...
<s> It's just...catching up with me, you know?
<s> And who are you?
<s> It wasn't in the cards.
<s> And he took a swing at you?
<s> Mm-hmm...that's not what the bartender told us.
<s> And what did he do to the girl?
<s> Well it's just kind of a coincidence, isn't it?  Stanton and Fleming, both started in '83, both in area six...both in Vice?
<s> Yeah?
<s> What did you do then?
<s> Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
<s> 1490...Breckinridge...
<s> I knew I could count on you.
<s> Both at the same bank...
<s> I'm going to need a way to get there.
<s> Hop in.
<s> Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
<s> Did you have sex with her?
<s> I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
<s> He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
<s> He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.  I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr. Leeds.
<s> That could be the tip of a 't.  Here and here. And here.
<s> When do they go to press?
<s> That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
<s> I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
<s> Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard...  maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
<s> Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
<s> What's one way?
<s> Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?
<s> ...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler.
<s> We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
<s> Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
<s> It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
<s> This is our boy...!
<s> He went to the men's room.
<s> Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
<s> They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
<s> The Tooth...
<s> My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.
<s> Yes...
<s> Not me.
<s> Thank you very much.
<s> Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
<s> What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
<s> Huh?  Will? Is that you?
<s> Hey, baby! Where are you?
<s> I have to see somebody.
<s> Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...
<s> I remember.
<s> I want to see you, too.
<s> Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
<s> I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
<s> I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
<s> We don't know that.
<s> Huh?
<s> I keep getting it for Christmas.
<s> You've read the transcript. It's all there.
<s> It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
<s> No.
<s> Pretty well.
<s> Yes.
<s> No.  Caspiar.
<s> George, I hate sitcoms.
<s> Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
<s> But wasn't it funny?
<s> No, I'm not gonna take it.  If I take it I'll break my back.
<s> You're BLIND!  There is no envelope anymore!!  It hurts me to say this... but there's only one solution --  I don't want you two to ever work together again.
<s> Of course!  But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support!  I can't be surrounded by negative energy.
<s> Y-yeah?  Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead.
<s> So who's gonna pay for it?
<s> Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
<s> Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting.  But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...
<s> Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...
<s> You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone.  You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience!
<s> Deal.
<s> I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.
<s> Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody else.
<s> No thanks.
<s> No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
<s> I can shtop whenever I want...
<s> Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
<s> I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
<s> It is apparently not working.
<s> Oh.
<s> Eh, sure.  We're trying to expand our audience base -- and I know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman.
<s> Andy, I'm calling you up like this because I have the utmost respect for your artistry.  But -- I need your permission to fire him.
<s> It's my name.
<s> You all look the same to me.
<s> It's Choi.
<s> I know.  It's her fault.
<s> We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
<s> If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
<s> Don't tell me you're a believer now?
<s> You killed them.
<s> My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them Morpheus.
<s> The Matrix isn't real!
<s> Sorry.
<s> They'll be able to track it.
<s> How do you know all this?
<s> The Matrix?
<s> What does that mean?
<s> More important than what is when?
<s> What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
<s> Show me.
<s> What -- what lesson?
<s> How?
<s> No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.
<s> She would say she knows enough.
<s> Why?
<s> What do you believe in?
<s> Yes I do.
<s> Honestly?  I don't know.
<s> Morpheus.  He almost had me convinced.
<s> No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time.
<s> Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
<s> We think you're bugged.  Try to relax.
<s> Yes.
<s> She told me...
<s> A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
<s> It might have been.  I'm not sure.
<s> There has to be something that we can do.
<s> I have to.
<s> I'm not the One, Trinity.  The Oracle hit me with that too.
<s> Do what?
<s> Not yet.
<s> What do they want?
<s> Mr. Wizard, get me the fuck out of here!
<s> I can't!
<s> Hurry, Neo.
<s> That means it's good.
<s> 'And with your spirit.'
<s> Yeah.
<s> And say what?
<s> Panther!  Same thing...
<s> Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
<s> I swear to God Charlie, it's the truth.
<s> Don't worry.  I can handle it.
<s> I don't like loading crates.
<s> Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
<s> He has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.
<s> No.
<s> What pipes?
<s> OK, get in.
<s> Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
<s> He'll be here.  Look, take this for now.
<s> How much was the original loan again?
<s> Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
<s> Ok.
<s> Oh...around...why?
<s> You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
<s> Teresa.
<s> All right.
<s> What was it?
<s> Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
<s> An apartment uptown?  Downtown?
<s> No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
<s> A paper on that one too?
<s> You're intolerable today.
<s> Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?
<s> I know...I know.
<s> You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine.
<s> Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
<s> For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing.  Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?
<s> The girls like it loud.
<s> Sal!... fourteen street.
<s> This is some boat.  Your father's?
<s> Friends of yours Michael.
<s> Sure.
<s> Ok guys...have a heart.  This is my business.
<s> And isn't it a lovely one?  So sturdy, so straight --
<s> Love that name.
<s> Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
<s> Allison, I trust you.  This is your thing.
<s> But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.  Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, "What does she want now?"
<s> He said he would be there with bells on.
<s> -- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
<s> Good, good.  Glad to hear it.
<s> Why yes, thank you.
<s> Then why did you bring it up?
<s> -- And now you're going to pee some more.
<s> Well, it's a big day.  Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff. Any thoughts?  Last minute refine- ments or variations?
<s> A voice?
<s> Me, too.
<s> As much as Joe's?
<s> For how long?  And why?
<s> Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
<s> I'm just giving you the truth.  There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth.
<s> But who is he?  What are his creden- tials?  What is his relationship to you?
<s> I don't think they're ordinary.  I love keychains.
<s> Joe, you do get around.
<s> Obeah evil.  I not evil.
<s> Make it go 'way.
<s> Not dis pain.  Dis pain tru an' tru. Make it go 'way.
<s> Yes.
<s> You loved back?
<s> She knows you real self?
<s> Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.
<s> Peanut butter.
<s> Do you love Drew?
<s> I don't have any.
<s> Then why are you here, Joe?
<s> Patients have visitors, not doctors.
<s> Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.
<s> It was everything.
<s> And is your heart beating strangely?
<s> I loved it.
<s> Oh, I hope a long, long time.
<s> Don't.  That will come later.
<s> It's a saying.
<s> Joe knows what you're saying, just being polite --
<s> You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
<s> Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
<s> It is a deal?
<s> Oh.  Okay.
<s> And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
<s> You tell me, Bill.
<s> Then I can't help you.
<s> Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --
<s> I told you, 'watch it'.
<s> I think you heard me, Bill.
<s> Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
<s> Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.
<s> Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
<s> Well, they're mine now.
<s> Does she know where she's going?
<s> It's time to put this person where he belongs.
<s> That's life.  What can I tell you?
<s> You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
<s> You fill the bill, Bill.
<s> Then don't.
<s> What?
<s> I'm here.
<s> I want to have a look around before I take you.
<s> No thank you, Quince.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?
<s> It's okay, Quince.  I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that.  Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.
<s> Yes, I believe I do.
<s> You think Drew will go for it?
<s> Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall we?
<s> He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --
<s> How did you know?
<s> You like him, don't you?
<s> You're only six-five once.
<s> Uh oh --
<s> What were you going to say?
<s> You're not listening --
<s> We've met.
<s> Will it?...
<s> Yeah, it's good to get together.
<s> It's something.
<s> I don't understand.
<s> Yes, but --
<s> Everybody's a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor?
<s> How 'bout another cup of coffee?
<s> You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
<s> You never know.  Lightning could strike.
<s> Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket.
<s> Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
<s> I think I know her.
<s> Just loud enough to wake me up.
<s> That's it.
<s> Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls -  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
<s> Couple days.
<s> Who did this to you?
<s> I forget.
<s> Don't say anything else.
<s> So you have information for me?
<s> Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
<s> Did you?
<s> Who did he go to meet?
<s> I told him about your car.
<s> Somebody's come. Already.
<s> What?
<s> Don't just waltz in here dressed like			  * that and order a beer.						  *
<s> How do you know about me?
<s> Thank you.
<s> It's good.
<s> Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.
<s> Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?
<s> You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes.
<s> Why?
<s> I'll ride with him. You follow.
<s> Because she'll have taken one look at your clothes and your car and started thinking of ways to turn the situation to her advantage. She's already got you staying with her, for fuck's sake. 
<s> From who?
<s> Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
<s> Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
<s> That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.
<s> I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.
<s> You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone who'll listen. "Remember Sammy Jankis, remember Sammy Jankis". Great story. Gets better every time you tell it. So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember?
<s> Just some guy. Does it even matter who? I stopped asking myself why a long time ago. No reason, no conspiracy; just bad fucking luck. A couple of junkies, too			 * strung out to realize that your wife didn't live alone. When you killed him,			* I've never seen you so happy - I was convinced you'd remember. But it didn't stick, like nothing ever sticks. Like this won't stick.
<s> To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. You know how many towns, how many		    * guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a John G.
<s> Quit it!							 * 					   * You're not a killer, Lenny. That's why			 * you're so good at it.						   *

<s> Lemon or lime?
<s> Gottingen.  That's in Sweden.
<s> Doing...?
<s> He any good?
<s> There's three between Miami International and the glades.  I'm gonna try for her, but this is triage.  Protect the maximum number of lives.  You need to know that...
<s> No, you don't, Jim.  'Cause if I close this down, you got nothing to make a phone call about.  And my guys don't have a week for a Feeb bureaucratic process.  Every hour longer they're in there, they risk exposure.  So, right here, right now, they're back in or I pull them out and close you down.  What's it going to be?
<s> Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
<s> 25% discount on the load.
<s> "Probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
<s> Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
<s> And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
<s> They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
<s> 'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...?
<s> This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
<s> I'll be on board by noon.
<s> "Extras" tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of "Things Aquatic"?
<s> "No, viejo.  That was José Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."
<s> What happened to the last transporter you <u>had</u>?
<s> Nothing.
<s> And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
<s> How do we do that?  Make a buy?  That went well...
<s> From the North Valle area.  New. Low-level, we think.
<s> Who's the "we"?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  "Low-level producer."  Yeah, right...
<s> I'm my <u>own</u> man.  And anytime you want to see how much man I am?
<s> Sonny...?
<s> I don't understand...
<s> Switek pulling this off...?  That's not faith; that's delusional...
<s> Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...
<s> A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily.  He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  Life is dust, make it while you can.  He's ambitious.
<s> Define small.
<s> Meaning...?
<s> Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from...
<s> You're hoping to get a look at what?
<s> Scuse me, hon, fraid I'm only half here. Maybe you oughta run on along. But why don't you take this phone number?
<s> Lotta rich women back there...
<s> No, ma'am, I'm not.
<s> Sure you're all right?
<s> For money for what?
<s> Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...
<s> Okay, right, right, okay. Another subject. Where you living? Still at the hotel?
<s> Whatsa matter now?
<s> Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough?  And keep your meat hooks off my radio.
<s> What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make a cowboy outta you, kid. How about that? Build you up a little, teach you couple little tricks'n turn y'out to stud, Rat-stuff.
<s> The coat? A guy I did a favor once gave it to me. Christ.
<s> Rico. Rico Rizzo.
<s> Twenty bucks...
<s> And what?
<s> I don't even want you to go. Whaddya think of that? I got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's God's gift to women. One twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in New York City. It's laughable.
<s> I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
<s> I mean New York's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'Hey, Ratso' -- how does that sound to you?
<s> Shee-it, you know, I got this thing all figured out, Ratso. I mean Rico. When we get to Miami, what I'll do, I'll go to work. I gotta do that, 'cause see, I ain't no kind of a hustler. I ain't even any goddam good as a bum. I'm a nothing, that's what I am. So reckon I'd better go to work and get me a goddam job. Okay?
<s> Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
<s> No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
<s> Uh, yessir.
<s> Twenty fucking YEARS, man - YEARS! I figger ten at the least.
<s> Yeah, what do you think this is, the good USA? This is Turkey, man... ) It's a fucking accident here if you're innocent. And anyway... ...ain't nobody who's innocent.
<s> Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
<s> Good.  Would you go back to the Pudding Shoppe now and point him out to my men if you see him?
<s> But just...
<s> He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
<s> That doesn't seem so bad.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Where is it?
<s> Two thirty.
<s> I want to cut his throat.
<s> Yeah? Where?
<s> Cat, ah!  Ayip!
<s> Mr. Yesil.
<s> Did you hear me?  Get Dr. Raymond! NOW!!
<s> Triad, Chinese Mafia. They bring people from Yunan. Slave labor...  Reverend Harry Wong, a preacher had the flophouse fronting for them. No sign of him.
<s> New York's finest.
<s> I think so. One right, two lefts...
<s> Right.
<s> Just do it!
<s> Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm going to-
<s> He can imitate anything, you just watch him.
<s> Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!
<s> "...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
<s> We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.
<s> We're down to a "couple" now, huh?
<s> Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
<s> Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
<s> You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
<s> Listen to me:  we're getting you out.
<s> I'm on it.  Don't worry.  Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter.
<s> What is it?
<s> Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. You didn't give me a chance to knock.
<s> I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
<s> Sure.
<s> But you didn't even taste your cocoa.
<s> It shouldn't be too much longer.  Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you.  Could I ask you a favor?  I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and...  and I wondered if maybe... 
<s> If you wouldn't mind.
<s> The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.
<s> I'm...
<s> No big deal.
<s> I know you didn't mean it when you killed her, and now you'll make it right.
<s> It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.
<s> Annie, what's the matter?
<s> You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian realized that the reason they'd buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma--
<s> Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
<s> Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
<s> But the time is now. Soon others will come.
<s> It will.
<s> You did perfect. Except for one thing. This time we need two glasses.
<s> He's your client, huh?
<s> You think he might be missing?
<s> I'm sure you're right.
<s> All done, chief..
<s> Well, you've thorough about it, at any rate.
<s> Hugh, I'm impressed..
<s> Then don't say it.
<s> Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
<s> Not going in from the ground.  Show me the atrium.
<s> I am. She is.
<s> Oh, either way works for me.
<s> Do what?
<s> At least you walked.
<s> Oh bloody hell.  You're a spy.
<s> I don't.
<s> Yes?
<s> Just about..
<s> Affirmative.
<s> Oh Ethan!..
<s> Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
<s> Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
<s> Like?
<s> Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
<s> Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers?
<s> Go to bed with a man and lie to him? She's a woman.  She's got all the training she needs.
<s> You mean it'll be difficult.
<s> I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
<s> Yes, I gathered as much.
<s> Yes.
<s> Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
<s> Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
<s> Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't be a vacation if you did.
<s> You keep calling me Dmitri.  You really shouldn't.
<s> Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual.  The visuals aren't coming up.
<s> You've got the voice print, I'll get us in..
<s> I'm not waiting 48 hours.  When we're done at Biocyte, if she's not out of Ambrose's, I'm going in and getting her out.
<s> I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.
<s> You're right, of course.
<s> Yes, Anatoly, yes.
<s> I donít know.  It didnít say on the tickets.
<s> Good idea.
<s> Always.
<s> May take a little time.
<s> Krieger.
<s> Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
<s> Talking's good, walking's better.
<s> Don't move.
<s> I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
<s> Who is they, who is they?
<s> No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!
<s> We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
<s> Is this the only way?
<s> They knew we were coming.  Golitsynís dead too.  The disk is gone.
<s> Donít <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
<s> Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Donít disappoint me.
<s> The arms dealer.
<s> How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole.
<s> Profitable.
<s> About what?
<s> Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys.
<s> Hey, I'm the flavour of the month!
<s> I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
<s> Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
<s> I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
<s> Bank?
<s> Where exactly is it?
<s> My contact is extremely shy.
<s> Jack.
<s> He's our guy.
<s> <u>Negative</u>, Golitsynís on the move.
<s> I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit up straight very well.  It's not important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I saw the mole.  It was Kittridge.  <i>Kittridge!</i>
<s> Youíre probably right.
<s> Ethan - Iíve always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth.  It can kill you.
<s> Connection denied.
<s> I always check the batteries.
<s> Just across the bay, at the fuel depot. The men wanted to try to get home. I can't explain.
<s> What?
<s> I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
<s> Hello, Mr. Castorini.
<s> He did?
<s> That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring?
<s> It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
<s> What'd you do to your hair?
<s> I don't understand.
<s> But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
<s> Instantaneous.
<s> Yesterday.
<s> A wolf without a foot!
<s> You're trying to make me feel guilty.
<s> But he wants me to come!
<s> Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
<s> It's the best thing there is.
<s> I wanna go home.
<s> You are guilty. I'm guilty.
<s> I know what I know.
<s> That's right.
<s> Is Johnny here?
<s> Yes?
<s> You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.
<s> Sure.
<s> Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
<s> I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
<s> Where's the ring?
<s> No.
<s> Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
<s> I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love bite on your neck. He's coming back this morning.
<s> Hey there  ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
<s> Hi. Why ain't you at the store?
<s> I don't know.
<s> I came right from the airport.
<s> She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.
<s> Johnny...
<s> You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
<s> I am alone in the world.
<s> It's nothing!
<s> Will you join me for dinner?
<s> I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
<s> Why do men chase women?
<s> Good night.
<s> What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
<s> Did you dress her up like this?
<s> Quiet! Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
<s> Does wood sink in water?
<s> So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea.
<s> I'm not interested.
<s> But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
<s> The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?
<s> The Britons.
<s> I am your king!
<s> That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
<s> You said it again!
<s> What are you going to do. bleed on me?
<s> This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
<s> That's it.  Ni!  Ni!
<s> Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.
<s> Greetings King Arthur.
<s> Yes, I can help you with your guest.
<s> It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
<s> Come on, patsy.
<s> And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?
<s> I'm not dead!
<s> My name is Sir Launcelot.
<s> But, Mother ...
<s> Listen, Alice ...
<s> Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
<s> Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...
<s> Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!
<s> I'm ... your son ...
<s> Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father - that's all -
<s> The what?  But you are tired and you must rest awhile.  Midget! Crapper!
<s> What is your name, handsome knight?
<s> No, It's nothing!
<s> Why?
<s> We'll cover your escape!
<s> No, I'm not.
<s> I am, sir. I am a Knight of King Arthur.
<s> Look.  I'm warning you.
<s> Brave, Sir Rob ...
<s> I didn't.
<s> No, no, no.
<s> There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.
<s> So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.
<s> I'm getting dressed.
<s> I'm all right.  I just need to rest up a wee bit.  The room ... You don't have to stay.
<s> I don't think I've had that pleasure.
<s> I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
<s> Quite.
<s> Whom you address.
<s> It is quite late enough.
<s> And that is my last word on the matter.
<s> How will I know what she requires?
<s> Aye, do.
<s> I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
<s> I am a blank sheet.
<s> I don't think about it.
<s> I'm not married.
<s> I do what I do.
<s> And I intend to be there when she's ready.
<s> Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
<s> I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
<s> Then why send me back to them?!
<s> It's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction.  She's never been less popular.
<s> Why am I being lectured in this way?!
<s> Why?
<s> I have no idea.
<s> My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
<s> Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
<s> You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
<s> Well...it involves a paradox.  You have to trick The Boatman.  Now all the while, you also have to watch your strength.  You can build that back up by catching FIREFLIES...the little glowing guys...
<s> Did you play ARCADE last night?
<s> But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
<s> Hey, kid.
<s> We are talking...
<s> It's twelve-thirty!
<s> I'm in the middle of it...
<s> How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.
<s> We can't...
<s> Like the fractals?
<s> You didn't hear me?
<s> One.  In case...
<s> The keys are supposed to be at the end of each level.  Once we get all the keys, we can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...
<s> Check your read-out.
<s> Screamer.
<s> We don't have a choice!
<s> And then keep on driving?
<s> Hold my keys, then.
<s> The Air-Force is working on the same thing.
<s> Give her a chance, will you?
<s> I'm going home Cynthia.
<s> I know.  Where are you Adam?
<s> And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
<s> You gotta be kidding?
<s> There is no problem.
<s> Howdy to you.
<s> Sure.
<s> I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
<s> That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
<s> Well, I ...
<s> I was afraid of that.
<s> It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...
<s> Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
<s> Right. See ya.
<s> I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.
<s> I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff.
<s> Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
<s> Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
<s> "My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..."
<s> "You know what I want...it's not that difficult."
<s> "What about you? What will your dad think about you?"
<s> Do you know them?!
<s> What ... I..HAVE... to do.
<s> Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Find out who they are?
<s> Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
<s> It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
<s> I'm an investment banker. I see blood bathes everyday. Besides, mine is not to question why, min is but to do or die.
<s> What's going on ?
<s> You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
<s> Give me a fucking.....
<s> No where. We've got about seven minutes before this thing slams into a concrete wall.
<s> You've been doing a bang up job so far. Right now Matt is probably dead and it's your fault.
<s> I'm listening.
<s> I'd say about thirty to forty minutes. Give or take a few.
<s> I've since changed my mind. I designed this place, based on my belief that I was doing what the legal system couldn't or wouldn't do. McCay had the company buy the property and they pay the bills. It's a tax write off. On the books everything looks kosher. I have an office on 5th that I haven't seen in ten years.
<s> Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real.
<s> Yes.
<s> I work here, remember ?
<s> Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
<s> You were one of those guys that played Dungeons & Dragons with real swords, weren't you.
<s> Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
<s> Look...
<s> I said NO.
<s> Got it.
<s> I just want to double check the facts.
<s> Yeah, but we're talking 43.
<s> Fire the whole division.
<s> I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?
<s> I make roughly four hundred thousand a year.
<s> Sir ?
<s> Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.
<s> Have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning.  First.... thing...
<s> We have new "guests" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?
<s> There was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs.
<s> What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
<s> He'll never make it out of the park alive. I promise you that....
<s> Well, Mr. Parker it seems that your is not the wardrobe of choice tonight. I'm quite confident that my tie is looking better than yours.
<s> The room will fill to the top, then if they wind up in the next room, they lived, if not, they're dead.
<s> I think I'll see hat action.
<s> Excuse me, gentlemen
<s> Thanks.
<s> What the hell kind of cop are you ?
<s> I just need to sit and think for a second.
<s> Fine, fine, I feel like a chicken McNugget.
<s> We made it !
<s> Come to the rescue again I see.
<s> No, no, no, I gave it up ten years ago...actually it gave me up.
<s> UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
<s> What about giving the other guy a break.
<s> I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing.
<s> Well not far, just down the hall. Plus Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood.
<s> Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
<s> Great.
<s> Her favorite poet.
<s> What??
<s> It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why don't you just say &quot;Oh Dad&quot; and get on the damn plane already?
<s> Vada I wanna ask you a favor, remember you can absolutely say no if you want to.
<s> Look we react to every kick this baby gives, maybe Vada's trying to tell us something too.
<s> Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.
<s> I've got something better.
<s> Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
<s> I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
<s> He likes you.
<s> No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.
<s> It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.
<s> O.K. Thank you very much.
<s> I want juice!
<s> You're so clever.
<s> MOM!
<s> Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
<s> Yearbooks always set you out for disappointment, I want mine to say: Nick probably won't amount to much, so don't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again. Can we go?...It smells like someone left their gym bag in here.
<s> Oh, no wait, I like that you bought me here.
<s> Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch.
<s> Owh...
<s> Oh no?!?!?!
<s> Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
<s> This is a totally barbaric custom.
<s> No...it was me. And I'm sorry mom, really, ju...just tell me what to do, I'll do anything.
<s> Ten bucks.
<s> Bye.
<s> Don't worry, I'll do it in my own subtle way.
<s> Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.
<s> Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
<s> Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?
<s> There's plenty of fruit.
<s> You know how I feel about you.
<s> Is that a yes?
<s> She'll be all right baby.
<s> Bye Niece, Vada.
<s> I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
<s> Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
<s> Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
<s> Oh no.
<s> Did she mention any contests that she won? I mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Yeah, it would be kinda great.
<s> I know, look at his little hands.
<s> Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
<s> Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.
<s> All right, here.
<s> Can't stay, I'm just here because my wife.....
<s> This guy bonking you?
<s> Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be &quot;OUR MUTUAL ASSET&quot;, not &quot;Shelly's recreational vehicle&quot;. Gimme the keys.
<s> What?
<s> Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break.
<s> My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.
<s> No.
<s> Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
<s> What Hurts Vada?
<s> Pardon?
<s> This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.
<s> It's no big deal.
<s> Oh, how do you mean?
<s> Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.
<s> Here?
<s> Is there enough room?
<s> Yes.
<s> Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
<s> It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
<s> Is it really your camper?
<s> Vada, just put 'em on the stool.
<s> Any more soda left?
<s> Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.
<s> You never cared before.
<s> I'm very nervous.
<s> Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!
<s> Will you tell her I came by?
<s> Thank you. Bye.
<s> Well, you never can tell...  I might get a pet. 
<s> Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work.
<s> Vada, this is an adult writing class.
<s> I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don't.....
<s> He likes her.
<s> Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
<s> Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh.
<s> Oh.
<s> Chocolate?
<s> I don't think so.  Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?
<s> You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.
<s> Hi.
<s> Oh great!!
<s> I'm eleven and a half.
<s> What are you saving for?
<s> You could pick that scab on your arm.
<s> It'll bleed.
<s> That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
<s> Come on, it's fun.
<s> Hey, where does it say that?
<s> Bye Mrs. Sennett.
<s> Really?
<s> My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
<s> Okay, okay.
<s> I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.
<s> Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...
<s> I have a suggestion...
<s> You have a real philosophy of life.
<s> It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
<s> Impressive.
<s> That was Thursday.
<s> Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
<s> Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
<s> ... his snoring, yeah.  He says it's worse than ever.  That snaffle one...?
<s> ... cigars in bed? I broke him on that.  But the bathroom's a swamp, he wears Reeboks to dinner, tells the same, admittedly funny, jokes three hundred times...
<s> ... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...
<s> Gold nose hair clippers.
<s> Hello.
<s> Exactly.
<s> He won't get mad, huh?
<s> It doesn't say th...
<s> But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people...
<s> Such as.
<s> First girl I ever knew.  Who lets me give her a bath.
<s> Till the gas ran out.
<s> She would never.  Never.  Even think of that.
<s> I never eat when I'm serene.
<s> You keep saying that.
<s> It's more than that.
<s> Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
<s> ... maybe it's congratulations.
<s> "Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."
<s> If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento...
<s> ... me, yeah.  And she likes Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed.
<s> I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
<s> ... and you knew about this.
<s> Well, if that's the way you f...
<s> MICHAEL!!
<s> I know that, Star.
<s> I won first prize.
<s> Well, I just wondered 'cause being from out or town I wouldn't be able to make anything.
<s> I see.
<s> Well, I just thought I'd call.
<s> How is that?
<s> Third party?
<s> ABC.
<s> Okay.
<s> When is it?
<s> What crook?
<s> Sure thing. Put them here... I'll take them.
<s> Not yet.
<s> Your brother?
<s> How in the world did he get shot?
<s> Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
<s> No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to tell you this -- your wire passed away -- I thought they'd called you at home.
<s> Oh... a little of both. Just thought I'd look around at Nashville for a while.
<s> Suits me.
<s> A little. What do you need?
<s> Replacement party.
<s> Well I've been following him around Just listening to him --He says he can really win -- I bet he can too - -
<s> No.
<s> Nash.
<s> I've been a Little dyspeptic.
<s> Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
<s> Yes, it is --
<s> About three years.
<s> Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see.
<s> Remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
<s> Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
<s> Hi.
<s> I've got a gig tonight.
<s> I have to go. He sighs.
<s> I can't.
<s> Oh.
<s> Yea.
<s> What?
<s> What!
<s> Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
<s> Why?
<s> Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.
<s> He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
<s> I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
<s> Well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... Ten minutes, okay?
<s> You think I should take lessons?
<s> You serious?
<s> It wasn't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they weren't gonna shoot unless we shot first. When we got out of the stairwell, I remember thinking, 'Oh my God. This might work.' But Mickey knew it would work all along. There wasn't any doubt in his mind. It's not like there was and he just didn't show it. He knew it would work.
<s> Thank you, sir.
<s> So, how do I fit into this scheme?
<s> Everybody knows who you are. You're famous.
<s> All right, Mickey.
<s> You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
<s> I said I'd give you a interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just did a interview.  We did an interview, didn't we?
<s> I don't give a damn if a million United States marines, all whistling the halls of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin' down this alley any second. There ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm leaving you. And that's that!
<s> And a snake-eye glare.
<s> Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
<s> I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
<s> Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer.
<s> Wayne Gayle.
<s> Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
<s> That sounds great. Look, I don't want any of this to intimidate you. This is not going to be a big deal. This is going to be very easy.  I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You guys get your equipment ready, power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote. Julie come with me.
<s> Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.
<s> Wayne, if it was anybody else---
<s> Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
<s> Stay up here and finish your interview, I've got to see what the hell's going on down there before I can take responsibility for you to film there.
<s> Now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.
<s> See Duff. He's the money man.
<s> That'll be thirty-eight cents.
<s> I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
<s> What d'you think?
<s> I'll smile when it's funny.
<s> Where was that?
<s> Have anything in mind?
<s> Oh yeah? That's good.
<s> No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
<s> What d'you expect?
<s> You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
<s> You almost got into trouble back there.
<s> Just for the day?
<s> I thought you wasn't comin'.
<s> What?
<s> Yeah?
<s> Yeah, that's so.
<s> Smells like something crawled in there and died.
<s> You still didn't answer my question.
<s> I don't want to hurt you.
<s> Yeah!
<s> 'You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
<s> Watch out!
<s> Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
<s> Not if you see them for what they are, Duff.
<s> How 'bout the key?
<s> You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
<s> Who're you?
<s> Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
<s> That's right.
<s> No, thanks.
<s> Okay.
<s> How are you?
<s> Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice.
<s> I guess I ain't.
<s> Well, that figures.  Kind of fits in with everything else, don't it!
<s> If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
<s> I ain't drunk, honey.
<s> Danny, I can't fucking wait anymore.  You hear me? Now where the fuck's my wife?
<s> Since when?
<s> Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.
<s> Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.
<s> Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.
<s> A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.
<s> Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
<s> It hasn't yet.
<s> I've arranged for him to work with us.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.
<s> I an' I, man. I an' I.
<s> Can you walk?
<s> What?
<s> The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
<s> We got problems topside.
<s> I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.
<s> 3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code.
<s> Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
<s> What's my end?
<s> ... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
<s> Then, fuck you. I'm gone.
<s> What?
<s> Hey... you're not supposed to be up.
<s> Almost two days.
<s> Too late?
<s> Okay fine. Let's get this over with.
<s> Case...
<s> Something exotic I hope.
<s> Shut up.
<s> Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.
<s> This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--
<s> That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.
<s> Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
<s> What about the "Roaring Twenties"… or "The 80's"?
<s> Roger in Op/Ed.
<s> You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
<s> At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
<s> Anita!
<s> 
<s> Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
<s> We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
<s> Sometimes opposites attract.
<s> Her dad sold a car to Leonardo Di Caprio's uncle and before he picked it up, her dad let us all sit in it and take pictures.
<s> Do I want to be crunched?
<s> You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
<s> A flack jacket.
<s> Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
<s> But I don't want it straightened out.
<s> No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
<s> He's my teacher!
<s> You already pitched this to Rigfort?!
<s> Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
<s> Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world.
<s> Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
<s> Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
<s> Do you remember high school?
<s> Rufus?
<s> I-
<s> Oh I don't think so.
<s> Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
<s> You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
<s> I know.
<s> I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
<s> Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
<s> Do you think you'll find her?
<s> Well, are you here with anybody?
<s> No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
<s> I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
<s> We're very evolved.
<s> I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
<s> We went through the door...
<s> And heavy...
<s> Where?
<s> I know.
<s> But why?  It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
<s> He stayed a long time.
<s> <i>                      -- A box? --        Is it steel? --                     Are there locks? -- Is it filled with a pox? --                          A pox! -- How delightful, a pox!</i>
<s> <i>                      -- A bow? --        But why? --                  How ugly! -- What's in it? --                What's in it?</i>
<s> Just out for a while.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> I wasn't sure, Ken...
<s> Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do?
<s> I'm Jesse now, Lisa.
<s> Jesse's dead, Lisa.  Freddy's here.
<s> My Dad.  He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college.
<s> Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
<s> How come?
<s> Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
<s> Uh-uh.  Before my time.
<s> Something Grady told me today about the people that lived here last. Girl went crazy - saw her boyfriend killed in the house across the street...
<s> World History.  But, I'll see you in the morning, right?
<s> I just got here myself.  Went to the Public Library.  Cut four classes!
<s> Like a haunted house, right?  I don't believe in ghosts.
<s> I don't know - into the air I suppose.
<s> There's nothing to figure out.
<s> Why won't you talk to me?
<s> What are you gonna do?  How are you gonna help?  I'm losing my mind.  I don't want to have you watch me fall apart.
<s> I'm okay.  Just leave me alone.
<s> All of them.
<s> Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
<s> But...it's just a house I've dreamed about.  I dream about it all the time.  Thank you for what you did last night.
<s> Yeah, but I was really not good.
<s> They sedated me.  We're stuck here till it wears off.
<s> I don't do that shit.
<s> Why is that?
<s> She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
<s> But Max, she needs me.  It could mean life or death.
<s> Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
<s> Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
<s> I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.
<s> Nancy...
<s> Ever work with vets?  These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat.
<s> What's that supposed to mean?
<s> All I can say is this isn't something that's just going to disappear.  you're all going to have to face it.  Fight it. And if you're willing to work together... wiling to stand up to your deepest fears...I think we can beat it.
<s> Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here?
<s> I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
<s> Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
<s> This isn't possible.  And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here?  Did you drag me in here too?
<s> All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
<s> They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.
<s> What?
<s> You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.
<s> Don't worry, it won't come to that.
<s> In the name of Elric, Prince of Elves, demon begone.
<s> Me too.
<s> Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...
<s> I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
<s> I'm an actress.
<s> No thank you.  I need to get my car back.
<s> You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
<s> Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
<s> No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.
<s> Yes.
<s> I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
<s> What did you say?
<s> You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
<s> She left me.
<s> No, you were brilliant
<s> I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
<s> Would you like me to take you through your lines?
<s> I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
<s> Yes.  Always have had.
<s> You have a stunt bottom?
<s> What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
<s> Who was Gilda?
<s> Stay forever.
<s> Don't ask.
<s> Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
<s> I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
<s> Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
<s> Thank you.  Shall I...
<s> You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
<s> ... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
<s> That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.
<s> Tempting but... no, thank you.
<s> I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
<s> Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
<s> ... get fired.
<s> Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
<s> Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.
<s> Well, obviously it's me, isn't it -- I work in the City in a job I don't understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me.  I haven't had a girlfriends since... puberty and, well, the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will.
<s> It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.
<s> Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
<s> Well, yes.  Groovy.
<s> It was good.
<s> Blimey.  What's that?
<s> How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
<s> Yes?
<s> Topol.
<s> But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
<s> Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
<s> Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
<s> Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.
<s> No, no.  She doesn't.
<s> Yes, she is fairly fabulous.
<s> Absolutely not.
<s> No, 'fraid not.
<s> And you get on very well.
<s> Fabulous.
<s> What?
<s> Yes, that's perfectly correct.
<s> No, Miss Ratched...
<s> I-I-I...
<s> You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
<s> Mister Washington.
<s> Thank you, ma'am...
<s> Yes, ma'am...
<s> Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
<s> I wanna report a robbery!
<s> What for?
<s> Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!
<s> No way.
<s> Thank you, ma'am.
<s> H-H-Hearts.
<s> B-B-Billy.
<s> 'K-k-kay, Mack!
<s> W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
<s> Wh-wh-wh-wh...
<s> I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
<s> Ca-na-da...
<s> Hey, what's that?
<s> So long, Freddy. Don't take any wooden nickles.
<s> My feet hurt...
<s> Your buddy is callin' ya.
<s> I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
<s> She's not all that homely, Mister McMurphy. In fact, she must have been a rather beautiful young lady.
<s> Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen!
<s> Just warmin' up.
<s> I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
<s> I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
<s> What for?
<s> No!
<s> I don't trust you!
<s> McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
<s> What's this?
<s> No! I wanna go!
<s> It is worth considering... Miss Ratched?
<s> I'm afraid not.
<s> What's the horse pill for, honey?
<s> I'm not upset. All I wanna know, for the lovva Jesus...
<s> I'm not going back in there. I told ya this was a one way trip. Now stand aside.
<s> Okay. Who else?
<s> To help you relax... please...
<s> Oh, yeah...
<s> Well, listen to this. He got mad at me one day. Boy, did he get mad at me. He took the light bulb, ya know. I thought he was going to cram it right up me, ya know. But he ate it. He ate the whole fucking light bulb.  Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me! Is he crazy?
<s> Hey, Martini! Psst! Scanlon! Ya dumb goons, come back here!  Come on, let's get 'em!
<s> Jus' playin' the game, sucker...
<s> That!
<s> Oh, yeah...
<s> I-- I must've misplaced it.
<s> It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.
<s> Buona notte.
<s> Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
<s> I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
<s> My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
<s> Dwayne?
<s> Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
<s> But Faith--
<s> No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
<s> Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
<s> NO.
<s> NO.
<s> Well, good.  Good for you.
<s> Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much.
<s> Exactly.  Besides, no hard feelings.  You found somebody.  I found somebody. I thought we could double.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Hi.  Are you... busy?
<s> In that case... no...
<s> No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
<s> You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
<s> A "little white lie"?  A "little white lie"?
<s> That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
<s> There is no us.
<s> Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
<s> And more...
<s> No.  He smokes.
<s> Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
<s> So, what's your point?
<s> Is he married?
<s> I don't know, Kate.
<s> Yeah.  I guess you're right.  I really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den.
<s> My God, you have...
<s> Maybe.
<s> Sure.  I'm fine.  I don't know why I never did this before.  I mean, what's the big deal?
<s> Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
<s> Only what?
<s> Nothing.
<s> ...and a fortune teller.
<s> The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
<s> No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
<s> It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
<s> You used to love it when I called you doll.
<s> It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
<s> Good strategy.
<s> That's really romantic.
<s> Sure we keep records!
<s> What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
<s> He was always a good kid. You know that.
<s> Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here.
<s> In a minute.
<s> And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
<s> Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
<s> Give it to me— my Pop's job—
<s> Which side are you with?
<s> And you spend all your time just learning stuff, huh?
<s> A teacher! Dong!!!  You know I admire brains. Take my brother Charley. He's very brainy. Very.
<s> Do you like pigeons?
<s> I only live up there and across the roof.
<s> Good. So do I.
<s> You don't mind yourself at all, do you.  Joey used to race pigeons.
<s> Hit me again, Mac.
<s> If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
<s> All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
<s> What for?
<s> Go ahead, wear it.
<s> I know... I know... .
<s> You?
<s> What I did to Joey.
<s> Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
<s> I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
<s> I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
<s> It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
<s> I thought you might want some hot coffee.
<s> You go to hell.
<s> O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
<s> Wilson— yeah—  yeah— I fought Wilson.
<s> Doyle.  Joey Doyle's... .?  ... .You're his... .
<s> 's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
<s> No.
<s> Hit me again.
<s> Thirty-six— sev— aah I lost the count.
<s> Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I—
<s> Listen, Johnny—
<s> You want to know somethin'—?
<s> I was only talkin' to her.
<s> I can't believe it— a small fortune.   You can't buy me— you're still a bum!  'Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey. 
<s> When we knock off let's have a bit of a party. We'll drink to God and Ireland, its whiskey and its women, to Joey and Edie—  and death to tyrants everywhere... .!
<s> One of these days.
<s> Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
<s> Okay.
<s> A situation easily remedied.
<s> A symbol, Master.
<s> She loved the bull ring and the matador.  She danced to their destruction. Now she dances to her own destruction.  Her dance is of skulls.
<s> As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
<s> It would seem so, Master
<s> I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
<s> Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
<s> Aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.
<s> Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
<s> Yes, it is.
<s> Tell me, how do you do that?
<s> No, thanks.
<s> You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
<s> I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.
<s> He'd call every once in a while.
<s> He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
<s> Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
<s> He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, "Okay."  Jack's so easy going.  He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband.
<s> Buddy'll take care of him.  Keep him out've trouble.  He's Jack's conscience. Always has been.  He tell you how they met?
<s> Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
<s> Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
<s> You better come see this.
<s> He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
<s> I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go?
<s> I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
<s> Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
<s> Just hung up.
<s> Tell me something, Buddy.  You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life?  Cause it occurred to me that everyone <u>talks</u> about doing it, but I don't know anyone who's actually gone and <u>done</u> it.  Do you?
<s> You know how I felt about her.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Half for doing what?
<s> I'll go with you.
<s> Jack --
<s> It was an unusual experience.
<s> Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
<s> You'll have to ask him.
<s> You're gonna use a ram?
<s> What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
<s> Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
<s> Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
<s> Wait, I know him --okay?
<s> Another C.
<s> It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
<s> Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any business in here.  To me this is holy ground, man.  You understand?  I got to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater.
<s> Break and enter, shit.  Take it and git, how it's done.  Don't waste any time.  That's how you do it.
<s> Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass like this.
<s> I thought so, too.
<s> Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
<s> Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
<s> Really.
<s> I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
<s> Really.  He has a cop's face.
<s> How do we do that?
<s> I just thought maybe you and me could--
<s> I don't think it works if we're somebody else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything?
<s> It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?"  It might happen only a few times in your life.
<s> So do you.
<s> I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
<s> You just did, for Christ sake.
<s> In the trunk?
<s> When?
<s> Oh, uh, right, thanks...
<s> You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
<s> You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
<s> Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
<s> Glenn?
<s> What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
<s> Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.
<s> I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> What-- when?
<s> I think you're forgetting, this is my car.  I drove it up here.
<s> Thanks.
<s> You not with probation, one of those?
<s> I'd like that.
<s> No?
<s> I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
<s> My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.
<s> I didn't have time.
<s> He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
<s> I told you, he isn't here.
<s> He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
<s> Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about.
<s> Red...Strange?
<s> Sir, I --
<s> Mai-tai's.  I got this to tell ya, about mai-tai's.
<s> Well, you p-puked on his feet.
<s> Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air!
<s> The Colonel helped me work it out.
<s> Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season. Don't hit the barn.
<s> Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.
<s> No.  You're trying to beat me.
<s> Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived, huh?
<s> Thank you, Sir.
<s> Bombers.
<s> Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
<s> The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.
<s> Brilliant, Admiral.
<s> Have the planes made it to China?
<s> All of 'em.
<s> Good—bye, Grandma.
<s> You're probably the only one who could carry it off.
<s> It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
<s> Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
<s> Well, besides Charlie, of course.
<s> That loud—mouthed little bitch~
<s> Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
<s> Don't say that...
<s> Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.
<s> They'll learn to live with it.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Great, isn't it?
<s> You know I do.  I even wrote you into my will.
<s> Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
<s> Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
<s> Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.
<s> What?
<s> I'm trying.
<s> She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.
<s> What would that be, sir?
<s> Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!
<s> What if we're witnessing the end of touch dancing?
<s> Okay.
<s> Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
<s> Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
<s> What?
<s> Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.
<s> Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn?
<s> Of course, dear. You're home now.
<s> It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
<s> I had a dream that Grandma died.
<s> I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
<s> For what?
<s> I don't feel very festive.
<s> What does Charlie think about that?
<s> He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit.
<s> You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself.
<s> Can I tell Diane that Peggy Sue got drunk or is that a deep family secret?  Well?
<s> I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
<s> Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
<s> You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
<s> I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
<s> I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
<s> I	know what a burrito is.
<s> That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
<s> When do we start?
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
<s> No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
<s> We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...
<s> Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
<s> Wait! I'll go with you!
<s> I... um...
<s> I wanted to get Geoff out of L.A. Just start things over, you know?
<s> I suppose so.
<s> Well we're glad to have you, Marjorie. You can call me Chase, by the way.
<s> He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...
<s> It sucked.
<s> What did?
<s> You think he'd believe it if he did?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> I don't know but I'm not taking any chances...
<s> You know everything, don't you?
<s> You'll have to get right on it, Andy, we're up against the statute of limitations.
<s> Andy?
<s> Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
<s> Oh, you're right, Beckett, you don't have an attitude problem.
<s> Yeah. Thanks, guys.
<s> I promise!
<s> I said, "Everyone's going to die, Jimmy. But Drew's not going to die of AIDS. There's a cure around the corner, and he plans to be around to take advantage of it."
<s> Close the law book.
<s> Ready for what, baby?
<s> Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would <u>you</u> desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way.
<s> Honesty is always best.
<s> Defined by Webster's as harmless.
<s> You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
<s> How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
<s> As in, the vegetable?
<s> They sabotaged me.
<s> Not bad.
<s> There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial.
<s> I'm an excellent lawyer.
<s> Yes.
<s> Sure thing.
<s> You bet. We'll see you later.
<s> No.
<s> As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
<s> Really?
<s> Hi, Mom. It's me.
<s> Are you on one of those conference calls? I hate when you put me on hold.
<s> Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug.  Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen.
<s> All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
<s> Objection.
<s> Yes.
<s> I'll withdraw.  You were aware, when you worked with Maria Torres, that she had AIDS, correct?
<s> Right.
<s> Uh.... No. Not really.
<s> What kind of people?
<s> Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.
<s> How many do you know?
<s> Probably since she was born.
<s> Yeah... ?
<s> Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?
<s> So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?
<s> Yes, we did.
<s> I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
<s> By God you <u>will</u> settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today?
<s> Hold it, Joe.  He wants to come back to work, Chuck.
<s> Kings are out of fashion. I'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant.  It's an anti-trust action.
<s> Holy Shit. Did you, Bob?
<s> Charles...
<s> Let's settle with Andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.
<s> Bob. I must ask you to shut the fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say "I might not be able to serve our clients to the <u>best of my ability</u>?" He said nothing. And now, Andrew Beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, Philadelphia, judicial establishment. My God.
<s> Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
<s> <u>What</u>?
<s> Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.
<s> Entered our minds.
<s> Had it with deals.
<s> Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
<s> Riddick? How close?
<s> Got a better idea. Come with <u>me</u>.
<s> Can we switch?
<s> Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
<s> Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
<s> What?
<s> Shut up.
<s> Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what....
<s> Thought you didn't believe his story.
<s> <u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
<s> What the hell's it matter?
<s> -- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
<s> "Some prophet guy." And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God.
<s> Quiet, please. Everyone.
<s> I would rather we all stay--
<s> And what about the cells?
<s> Which half?
<s> He will be with us. Nonetheless.
<s> He's running us 'round in circles. Look for yourself. Look!
<s> Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
<s> Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.
<s> Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.
<s> Well, you got the big gauge.
<s> Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
<s> What, it's broken?
<s> Just the same, I want one.
<s> No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
<s> Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.
<s> The evidence was very meager --
<s> Zira....
<s> Him.
<s> Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
<s> What signal?
<s> You don't seem very cut up about it.
<s> There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
<s> You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.
<s> In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
<s> Yes, I can do that.
<s> I think you're making a mistake.
<s> Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
<s> Mind your tongue, madame.
<s> Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.  As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.
<s> That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.
<s> All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
<s> Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
<s> A hearing.
<s> Which one?
<s> No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
<s> Taylor, you can't.
<s> God bless you.
<s> He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.
<s> Where?
<s> Says he can't walk.
<s> Tricky bitch, reason you gimme dat turkey loaf is nobody else can eat that shit 'cept me so don't start your game playing with me Junior.
<s> What?
<s> Barnes comes from Hell.
<s> Hang tough, Gator. Hang in there, man, you're gonna be OK... just hang on.
<s> You guys trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head. 'Lias didn't ask you to fight his battles and if there's a Heaven - and god, I hope so - I know he's sitting up there drunk as a fuckin' monkey and smokin' shit cause HIS PAINS HE DONE LEFT DOWN HERE. Baaaaaaaaa! 
<s> Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
<s> Go on, whatcha gotta lose, yo' here now...
<s> ...there's nobody.
<s> Who gives a shit!
<s> Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
<s> Knock it off! We got two men need attention here. Police up your extra ammo and frags, don't leave nothing for the dinks. Hoyt, Junior, carry Gardner.
<s> Merle? Jesus!... Patty?
<s> ...and you know how many times he done been shot?  Seven times!  Seven.
<s> So he got a reduced and come over here. Nam's his freedom man, Nam's his pussy. Three years he been here.
<s> He dugged his own grave.
<s> Baaaa! Fuck it, they sold us out - so what! What'd you'all expect? Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT man. They're ROBOTS man - watchin' dopey television and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody dies. That's all right, you keep fuckin' up, politicians keep lyin'. Cause it don't really matter. Don't mean shit. So what! Whatcha want - a parade! Fuck that too! No war time no grunt never got no respect. Till he was dead - and even THEN! You're fighting for YOURSELF man! You're fighting for your SOUL, dat's all. Remember dat. And it's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle with that angel...  ...Love and Hate - the whole shitbang show, that's the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna change...
<s> My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
<s> How far does this train go?
<s> I really don't know.
<s> I'm supposing.
<s> I'm trying very hard to be polite about it.
<s> If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz.
<s> Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell...  ..don't. I'm warning you.
<s> I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself.
<s> I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone.
<s> No thanks.
<s> Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
<s> That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
<s> They'll look for you.
<s> And Betty Mayfield--
<s> But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
<s> You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
<s> Frozen.
<s> Wonder what?
<s> Yes.  Yours.  You haven't murdered anybody.  You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident?  It must have been.  If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore.
<s> Magruder does.
<s> Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
<s> I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
<s> I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
<s> A graduation present.
<s> There isn't anything you can do.
<s> Looking for peanuts, I suppose.
<s> I know that.
<s> All right. Get him.
<s> You asked for it.
<s> You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
<s> Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic.
<s> Leave that one lay.
<s> You're not English.
<s> How's life treating you?
<s> Round of golf Saturday?
<s> Would that make me a heel?
<s> Doesn't answer the question.
<s> You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
<s> Mr. Mitchell.
<s> Oh, shut up!  You haven't even got your spats on.
<s> They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
<s> Floater?
<s> Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
<s> Talk English.  How do I know you're you?
<s> Open it and count it.
<s> I hate to pull rank on you Sergeant, but once in a while...for moral purposes...you might address me as "Inspector". In moments of extreme desperation, you might even call me "sir".
<s> Correct, Inspector. A woman's gun. U.S. 125 caliber ammunition in it. It was on a table in there.
<s> That leaves two strangers.
<s> How do you do, sir.
<s> You'd go to jail. For a long term.
<s> You don't have to make a pose of it.
<s> A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
<s> In an hour, Larry.
<s> Unsophisticated?  If I knew about this babe...
<s> What a shame.
<s> Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
<s> Thanks.
<s> Yes.
<s> What went wrong?
<s> Don't tell me you've actually read it, Jeremy.
<s> Of course.
<s> Freshman and sophomores...
<s> I think it went on rather too long.
<s> And I didn't like that man.
<s> Both dead.
<s> Two or three years ago I would have stayed.  And fucked you.
<s> What did he want?
<s> Name so Susie Barrington.  Daughter of the eminent historian, Anne Barrington, step-daughter of the scandalous Matthew Byrd the acclaimed sack-artist...
<s> Come on.  Hand over.
<s> Let me see.
<s> We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
<s> On the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights--
<s> Suez.  1956.
<s> In that case, you should meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift.
<s> We might be able to dig out a couple of Suez survivors for you.
<s> Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
<s> My man!
<s> After you, Alfonse.  I insist!
<s> You first!
<s> Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.
<s> But you're not alone.
<s> I'm not FBI anymore.
<s> I take the skin off chicken.
<s> Fine.
<s> The shit they pull, huh?
<s> Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway.  L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero?
<s> Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
<s> Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions.
<s> Got it...
<s> He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
<s> This Zen master surfer.
<s> Kid, get outta the way!!
<s> I need you to teach me.
<s> I'm serious.
<s> Sure.
<s> Catch of the day.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
<s> Tyler, put the gun down.
<s> Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.
<s> That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to.
<s> The best friend I ever had.
<s> I think it's Hawkins.
<s> Philip!  We'll need shoes!
<s> Who indeed...
<s> This time I imagine you would, yes.  Hmm...  With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?
<s> What's that?
<s> Yes.
<s> You're not from L.A., huh?
<s> Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
<s> You don't know habits, you think this is ugly.
<s> Edward.  My name is Edward.
<s> Off the boulevard.
<s> Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
<s> I'd say you give a good dollar value.
<s> There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
<s> No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
<s> Any good?
<s> I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
<s> I have work to do.
<s> Easier than learning how to be poor.  My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  And he took his money with him.
<s> I'm sure that's true for some of them.
<s> Ready to stomp sod?
<s> Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
<s> Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
<s> I'll call you a cab.  If you want the clothes, pack them up.
<s> I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
<s> Where are you taking me!?
<s> I more than liked it.
<s> Yes.  The man made a business decision.
<s> It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
<s> Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
<s> I'm here.
<s> We don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. Besides...  You've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you?
<s> Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.
<s> I'm up.
<s> I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
<s> Have a good day, gentlemen.
<s> Was that you?
<s> What do you know?  You look <u>good</u>. All dressed up.  You clean up real nice.  You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway.
<s> Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
<s> Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
<s> What?
<s> And who is that?
<s> Hmmm... I vonder vich. 
<s> I'm just looking, thanks.
<s> Then I'm here till I die?
<s> Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
<s> Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
<s> Of course you will.
<s> Well ... you were dead.

<s> Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it  -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
<s> I believe you -- So what happens now?
<s> It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.
<s> What do I do?
<s> If there are, we'll all be dead.
<s> We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.
<s> What?
<s> The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
<s> All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
<s> I tell you once again -- surrender!
<s> Who won? How did it end?
<s> Let me explain --  -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.
<s> I thought he was with you.
<s> Stop saying that!
<s> -- offer me money --
<s> -- offer me everything I ask for --
<s> Your first story was better.  Where's that bellows?  He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him.
<s> Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
<s> More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
<s> You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.
<s> Oh, have it your way.
<s> -- there's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.
<s> Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
<s> You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?  You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
<s> I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
<s> A good hour. Yeah.
<s> I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
<s> "Honeymoon,
<s> Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical conversation.  How humiliating.  Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.
<s> It's nothing ... nothing.
<s> Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
<s> Aaaaaaaaaa!
<s> I'm hysterical.  I'm having hysterics.  I'm hysterical.  I can't stop.  When I get like this, I can't stop.  I'm hysterical.
<s> It's a little better, but you still look angry.
<s> Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
<s> I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!
<s> Max, what is it?  What are you doing?  What's happening?
<s> I'm going to buy a toy.  I worked very, very hard and I think I deserve a toy.
<s> It's gorgeous.  Absolutely gorgeous. You couldn't have picked a better color.  It brings out your eyes. Let's face it, Roger, that dress is you.
<s> To failure!
<s> No way out.  No way out.
<s> Ahhhhhh.  Leo, Leo, Leo.
<s> Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
<s> Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're not from the government.  We came here to talk to you about your play.
<s> You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
<s> Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
<s> Got dag pa dig.
<s> No.  We go. 
<s> No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
<s> Oh, the best one.
<s> Oh, I'd better hurry back.  I don't want to miss one minute of it.
<s> By the sacred memory...
<s> Hindenburg...
<s> Heil you know who!
<s> Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
<s> Vat?
<s> Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.
<s> What do you do best?
<s> No good, baby, no good.  You heard my orders.  Nobody retreats. Attack!  Attack!
<s> Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
<s> No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
<s> She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
<s> Tell me all about her.
<s> Of which morning?
<s> How do you know she didn't make a call?
<s> No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
<s> Who are you, friend?
<s> Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
<s> Not even a hunch. Just hope.
<s> But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
<s> I don't need pills... just sleep.
<s> Buzz me the minute she comes in.
<s> I think something's wrong, too, Miss. But not the same thing. I think your private detective is what's wrong.  I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going... probably from Norman Bates...  and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.
<s> To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
<s> Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
<s> He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
<s> No.
<s> You've led a charmed life.
<s> Maybe we can handle it together. 
<s> Of course we will.
<s> This is the old highway.
<s> I'm glad we didn't.
<s> What makes you sound so certain?
<s> The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!
<s> It didn't get washed down. It's figuring... the kind you tear up and get rid of.  Some figure has been added to or subtracted from... forty thousand.
<s> Don't miss your plane.
<s> Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
<s> Thank you. Again.
<s> It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Please go ahead.
<s> Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
<s> No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
<s> I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
<s> I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> Now what?
<s> He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
<s> He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right?
<s> Mother, please...
<s> Left Phoenix under her own steam?
<s> From what?
<s> Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
<s> Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
<s> Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
<s> I understand my husband is-- your assistant. May I see him please?
<s> Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly.
<s> [Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
<s> Sure--I have one little job to accomplish, then we can leave together. No doubt you are surprised at this disguise.
<s> No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
<s> Maybe you're right.
<s> He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.
<s> Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
<s> Well, news of Buckley?
<s> Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
<s> Oh, yes, he's in good hands now.
<s> Do you have many patients, doctor?
<s> Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru.
<s> Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.
<s> I'm losing my blood!
<s> Yes!
<s> That called ... commanded ...
<s> Joseph returns from the room where Gisèle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
<s> I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
<s> You would.
<s> I'll have it for supper.  So long.
<s> Ouch! Eat? You can do a solo if you don't step on it. I'm going to bow out on you.
<s> I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I see. And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30.
<s> Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
<s> I'm not quarreling, only ...
<s> I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.
<s> I'd love to, at any time.
<s> Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
<s> That you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.
<s> If this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. But he's George Winton and they're playing him up. It's a Roman holiday for every paper hat editor in New York.
<s> I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
<s> I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
<s> No kiddin'. What's your idea?
<s> You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
<s> Well, maybe it was. I don't remember.  You got to do something for me, I can't stand it any longer -- I can't!
<s> They don't suspect <I>him</I>?
<s> There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.
<s> It's all yours.
<s> My lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and I warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. Dad won't stand for--
<s> No -- No -- I -- I -- I don't want to see it. 
<s> You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
<s> She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
<s> I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. 
<s> That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
<s> Thanks.
<s> Dad...
<s> You did miss --
<s> Excuse me???
<s> That's the physicist's playground.
<s> This isn't punishment, I don't believe in punishment. It's for your health. Obviously you're sick if you can act like that.
<s> Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice name, I like it. I am real pleased to meet you.  Hey, look, do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere?
<s> He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.
<s> Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
<s> But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
<s> What did you expect?
<s> But why, if I'm not hurting you?
<s> Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
<s> They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
<s> Buddy, sex don't mean a thing to me. It ain't nothin' but a mosquito bite.  I'll tell you a secret. Girls don't want sex, Buddy, girls want love.
<s> Well, yeah.
<s> Yeah, he's still up there.
<s> Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
<s> No, you didn't say that, Brother.
<s> She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
<s> She's watching the car again?
<s> Yeah.
<s> At least.
<s> You shouldn't watch such things, Doll.
<s> Wonderful? He kissed her and played with her titty, and I don't see anything so great about that. He was probably afraid Mother would come back early and catch him.
<s> Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
<s> She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
<s> Then why does she act so dumb?
<s> Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
<s> Yes, I guess he did. He threw her away and it was the mistake of his life.
<s> No, son, she is dead.
<s> I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.
<s> Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
<s> Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
<s> There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
<s> What time is it?
<s> Rose, I realize you don't know this boy, but if you know anybody who does know him, if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be, then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife... and I don't mean maybe.
<s> Darlin', Rose has got to go!
<s> Who?
<s> Don't make me... me... me... get up!
<s> If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
<s> There are more on the other side.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
<s> I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
<s> Where is he? Where have you got him hid?  Ah, ha!
<s> Tennessee?
<s> Mine.
<s> Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!
<s> Galley proof.
<s> She has other things to do, Dave.
<s> She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
<s> Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
<s> No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
<s> Mrs. Hillyer, this girl is sick in more ways than one. She is an extreme psychoneurotic with uncontrollable sexual impulses. It would be a mercy to spare her the suffering she causes herself and others. Therefore I recommend as a therapeutic measure the removal of her second ovary. It is ethically and medically the only proper decision in this case and I suspect your husband agrees with me.
<s> Illusions, Madam?
<s> She was raised on a poor dirt farm. I'm sure she's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor.
<s> Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
<s> Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
<s> Yes, ma'am.
<s> Yeah, it's kinda nice.
<s> Now you know what to watch for...
<s> I don't know.  Fuck off!
<s> She's fine, as if you cared.
<s> I'll give you a fucking hoot if you don't shut up back there.
<s> That wasn't my fault.
<s> What do you want me to do about it?
<s> Relax.
<s> It's personal.  We'll hook up at Billy-Boy's pad in an hour.  See ya then.
<s> Lots of these pencil-pushers work out of their homes.  It's a tax dodge.
<s> Beats me.  You got a suggestion, feel free to shout it out, genius.
<s> What?
<s> It's just the way things are, kiddo.
<s> You can't be serious.
<s> Well, sir...
<s> What?
<s> Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
<s> Whoops... don't mind me.  Go ahead and finish up.
<s> Oh yeah?
<s> All for one...
<s> Dead.
<s> When you bunch it together, it's exponentially more powerful.  Two sticks have the power of four sticks. Four sticks have the power of sixteen, and so on.
<s> Keep 'em busy.
<s> They're... around.
<s> We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us.
<s> I can't kill my own father.
<s> Yoda spoke of another.
<s> Luke!
<s> It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
<s> Good, I hate long waits.
<s> Let's see.
<s> Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
<s> Red Leader standing by.
<s> Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.
<s> I see them. Wait, Leia!
<s> You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
<s> There is no conflict.
<s> Oh. Well, yes.
<s> Certainly not!
<s> I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?
<s> Nothing.  Why do you think I should?
<s> Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
<s> Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.
<s> On my mother's grave.
<s> Janet.
<s> Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
<s> Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
<s> They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
<s> Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.
<s> Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
<s> Makes you cry
<s> No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
<s> The delivery boy.
<s> ...Fine.
<s> ...I'm sorry.
<s> ...I don't know.
<s> Morning after?
<s> Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
<s> Sharp -- Real nice.
<s> ...Yes --
<s> Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
<s> Don't say that.
<s> That so.
<s> You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
<s> ...I don't feel heat from the name.
<s> You're hurtin', man!
<s> I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
<s> Fouls.
<s> Don't like yours neither.
<s> Move your shoulders down.
<s> Why?
<s> Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
<s> It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.  That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?
<s> How 'bout some Cokes?
<s> Yeah -- My ol' man who was never the sharpest told me -- I weren't born with much brain so I better use my body.
<s> Not yellow, cautious.  See, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
<s> He's always in a bad mood.  Count ya blessin's. Ya a healthy person -- ya legs work -- ya hands work --
<s> Hey -- if a good man can make a better life, let him make it.
<s> I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner.
<s> What?
<s> I said, how ya feelin'?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
<s> Yeah --
<s> I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.
<s> ...Ya gave Dipper my locker.
<s> Whatta ya think that outfit cost?
<s> Damn! How's it look?
<s> Yo, can I have my locker back?
<s> It ain't your locker no more.
<s> Listen, I'm with you -- But ya gotta talk to Mickey -- I put ya stuff in the bag over there.
<s> Yeah -- See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.
<s> Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
<s> ...Adrian ain't sharp.
<s> I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
<s> Gazzo's gotta come to you.
<s> Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.
<s> Gazzo's a good man.
<s> Whatta you think?
<s> Whatta these guys want?
<s> What can I do about it?
<s> What break? Huh? What break! Who am I to give breaks! I'm a fighter, you haul meat. You do what you do an' I do what I do best -- that's it -- that's life, man!
<s> Maybe --
<s> Feel? I dunno... Happy.
<s> Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
<s> Check the scrawl.
<s> Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.
<s> Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.
<s> <u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
<s> Maroon, right?
<s> What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
<s> So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
<s> Ask her...
<s> So you're Cloverleaf?
<s> It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.
<s> Surprised?
<s> I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
<s> That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.
<s> Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will.
<s> What a gasser.
<s> Doom.
<s> Aren't you the lucky one...
<s> Frankly, I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.
<s> Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
<s> Divorce?  Never!
<s> I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
<s> Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.
<s> Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.
<s> And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
<s> Yeah?
<s> I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
<s> I do bite my thumb, sir!
<s> Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze. I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
<s> In love?
<s> Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
<s> She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
<s> Teach me how I should forget to think.
<s> Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him
<s> The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
<s> Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
<s> O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness! This is dear mercy and thou sees it not. Hence!
<s> And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.
<s> Madam, in happy time what day is that?
<s> Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
<s> I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
<s> Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.
<s> Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
<s> Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
<s> I will not fail: 'tis twenty year till then.
<s> Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
<s> I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.
<s> A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world- -why, he's a man of wax.
<s> Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
<s> The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
<s> Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
<s> Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
<s> I thought all for the best.
<s> Consort? What does thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords. Here's my fiddlestick. Here's that shall make you dance! Zounds, Consort!
<s> What wouldst thou have with me?
<s> Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all
<s> To make a point.  I don't know her, and I was ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk.  I don't particularly like you, so imagine what I'll do if you try anything...
<s> Very good.  Now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid.
<s> And I don't believe you...
<s> Who the fuck are you?
<s> Best beer in the world known to man or God.
<s> Now there's the Deirdre I know.
<s> Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
<s> You lose them!
<s> They're good!
<s> Shut up!!!  Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!?
<s> Is that right?
<s> Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
<s> Should any of you decide to rush me, I'll kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time.
<s> Bad company...
<s> No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.  Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely.
<s> I swear, it has to come here!  It has to...
<s> Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
<s> I sent it to myself in Paris.
<s> Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
<s> Call it a reckoning of character.
<s> Fine with fucking me, we got work to do. I don't care what it takes, we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gonna pay us a great deal of money when we do.  I don't know about the rest of you guys, but I'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass.  I don't mean that in, like, a literal way...
<s> I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
<s> So is the woman.
<s> I wanted to see who you were.
<s> Know what?
<s> Because that's what I would have done...
<s> Gregor's cell phone...
<s> Please, help yourself.  Smoke as many you'd like.
<s> Not necessarily.  He could go off road at any number of places.  He might not even be in the country anymore.
<s> If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
<s> Why are you driving?  You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads.  Why are you driving?
<s> And when you finish?  What then?  This package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA?  Do you really think they deserve it?
<s> What of it?
<s> I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
<s> Gone.  Destroyed.
<s> You sure?
<s> A friend.  I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
<s> The Russian would be easier.
<s> I can't get enough of it.
<s> What makes you so sure?
<s> You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
<s> I...I can't do that.
<s> I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that!  We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
<s> For Christ's sake, Booth, I just needed to take care of a few debts is all!  You got my word on it --I'm not going near it again until everything cools down.
<s> How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
<s> There it is...now what about the others?
<s> We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
<s> Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
<s> That's right.
<s> Uh huh.
<s> Rock solid.
<s> No.  It's not.
<s> You better believe it if you know what's good for you!
<s> Shut up, Jesse.
<s> What for?
<s> I might have to look into that...
<s> You deserve it is the occasion.
<s> And I'd take it out on him.
<s> There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here.
<s> He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
<s> What?
<s> We appreciate that.
<s> Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
<s> Is this marked money, or what?
<s> Well I just uh, you know...
<s> We are having a sale on some items over here --
<s> Sure.
<s> Well I'm here now.
<s> Not much to tell.  Nothing really happened.
<s> Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace!  Is that asking too much?
<s> Calm down --
<s> Well you're not getting, either.
<s> Well, same ol' same ol'.
<s> It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you.  But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.
<s> I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
<s> I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me out!
<s> Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak, I don't care what he says.  Where is he?
<s> What??  Where'd you hear that?
<s> Is this about the funny money?
<s> I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
<s> Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
<s> Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
<s> We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
<s> What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
<s> C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
<s> That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
<s> Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!
<s> Try to land on your feet.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> How you doin'?
<s> Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
<s> Who?
<s> Good at what?
<s> Ask me if I give a shit.
<s> What?
<s> How do you know?
<s> Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
<s> Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
<s> There's people up here!
<s> You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
<s> Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
<s> No.
<s> No mu-shu.
<s> Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
<s> Forget it.  It doesn't matter.
<s> They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
<s> It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
<s> Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.
<s> Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.
<s> About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
<s> The Plaza Hotel?
<s> Fine with me.
<s> I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You have to trust me.
<s> The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
<s> Baby Duck?
<s> Any leads?
<s> It's my responsibility.
<s> Don't.
<s> Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my "still".
<s> That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
<s> Carter.
<s> No.
<s> Witnesses.
<s> Oh yeah, but this is on the way.  And you gotta see John Wayne's footprints. Everybody does. It's almost like a law. You can't believe how small his feet were for a dude that big. Tiny god damn feet!
<s> You don't know what a shortcut is?
<s> What plate?
<s> He was trying to kill me, not you.
<s> It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
<s> Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
<s> Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
<s> Come on!
<s> Thank you. I learn a great deal.
<s> You know him?
<s> Where'd you get it?
<s> Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks.
<s> With the FBI. What do you think I'm talking about?
<s> No way in the way!  I'm talkin' back up, Johnson. I'm in charge! And I need you, baby.
<s> That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!
<s> Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
<s> I'm waitin' here for a name.
<s> As I said, sir, we've got all the people we need.
<s> Carter, can I have a moment?
<s> Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
<s> Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
<s> So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
<s> You bet ya, Coach.
<s> How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
<s> Thank you.
<s> His hair... any color.
<s> Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.
<s> Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
<s> Then you'll be my best man.
<s> Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
<s> And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.
<s> Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
<s> No, I'm not.
<s> Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
<s> Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of Skipper.
<s> Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know.
<s> Gotta tell you this about my daughter. My daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels.  Maggie may not be Hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest.
<s> You'll answer my questions?
<s> We think so.
<s> He is not!
<s> Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.
<s> Really.
<s> I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
<s> Still sweet.
<s> He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.
<s> So?  Is that what you said to her?
<s> Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
<s> And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
<s> A little longer for me.
<s> I love you, too.
<s> And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
<s> So am I.
<s> I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I?  But I can't speak for Italics.  Traitor!
<s> I think so... When I was walking down the aisle?  I was  walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was.  And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted.  So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.
<s> Yup!
<s> Where?
<s> Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
<s> No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
<s> Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?
<s> Good boy, Port Hole.
<s> I changed it.  See you later, Mr. Travis.  That guy has a problem... Maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own.
<s> "And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground"  Holy moly.
<s> No.
<s> Is there somebody else?
<s> What am I going to do with a microwave?
<s> Nope.  Not even when I was young.
<s> That doesn't make any sense.
<s> Walter, there's something I have to tell you --
<s> At the top of the Empire State Building --
<s> Not.
<s> They knew it.  Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It was right.  It was real.  It was...
<s> I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
<s> "I want to meet you..."
<s> No.
<s> I know.
<s> The kid is on.  You've got me listening to this garbage. Go on, turn it on.
<s> You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
<s> That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.
<s> I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
<s> It doesn't mean anything.  It was written before I went out there.  Before the ho.
<s> Okay.
<s> Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
<s> How am I going to explain this to Walter?
<s> It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
<s> Any time.
<s> I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
<s> You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
<s> Mom, we already...
<s> It's a sign.
<s> Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
<s> Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
<s> What's she talking about?
<s> I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.
<s> Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
<s> Tell her how you don't sleep at night.
<s> How about rapacious and love- starved?
<s> I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay.  That's not what I need your help for.  I want to know what it's like over there.
<s> I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
<s> Yeah.  What's that?
<s> I don't think I have to now.
<s> My feelings exactly.
<s> I forgot to mention.  Jed called --
<s> They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
<s> What was?
<s> The water tastes better in the kitchen.
<s> No.
<s> It might be in the kitchen.
<s> Hi.  He should book now because we can get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travel agents and --
<s> Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
<s> What about it?
<s> I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
<s> Now that I'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.
<s> So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
<s> He's good at it.
<s> I don't make policy.
<s> You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.
<s> An American.
<s> With Ramón it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
<s> Got to talk to the brothers.
<s> What has it got me, your union?
<s> Have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
<s> But it's yours. I won't let them ...
<s> We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
<s> Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
<s> Shut up, you're talking crazy.
<s> Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
<s> You mean Delaware?
<s> New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
<s> You've got to help around the house!
<s> You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
<s> You think I was going to work you over? I wouldn't dirty my hands with you ...
<s> Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
<s> The spiders.
<s> Not even a guess?
<s> Leave me out of this.
<s> Ouch.
<s> You get off on abuse or something?
<s> Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
<s> What happened to your eye?
<s> Trust me. We're safe.
<s> Like you?
<s> What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.
<s> I can't tell you.
<s> I don't want to leave you.
<s> You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
<s> Guess it's our turn.
<s> Why's that?
<s> You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man.
<s> 10%.  That's ...
<s> Personal protection. It's a dangerous world we live in, Jimmy, a very dangerous world.
<s> Palmdale
<s> Yes, Jimmy.
<s> Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.
<s> I'm sorry. I couldn't.
<s> Understand what?
<s> Make me an offer.
<s> I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
<s> Anything for a dear friend.
<s> I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God!
<s> Yeah.
<s> You go, boy.
<s> It was all pretty informal.  Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
<s> Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.
<s> Standard vig.  Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.
<s> Whata you mean I've got no choice?
<s> Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant.
<s> Yeah.
<s> And what does this have to do with me?
<s> Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.
<s> Now that's scary!
<s> Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
<s> It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
<s> He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
<s> The numbers don't make sense, sir. His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away.  One private is simply not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson This one is.  He's worth a lot more than that.  Which is why I'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is.
<s> Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
<s> What deal?
<s> In the shadow by those two trees.
<s> Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
<s> FORWARD!  FORWARD!  NOW REVERSE!
<s> Like I said, it was nothing.  Don't bunch up.
<s> A machine gun.
<s> Sure, you got one?
<s> But, sir...
<s> Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap.  The other five right behind.
<s> I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
<s> Three for three.
<s> It doesn't take this.
<s> You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore.
<s> How about you shut up and take your position?
<s> Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot.  He's done this before.
<s> Just what I want to do.
<s> Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.
<s> Well, I, for one, like cheese.
<s> ON THE BRIDGE!  WE'RE COMING IN.
<s> Have it your way, Captain.
<s> See to it.
<s> And Sarge?
<s> As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.
<s> Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
<s> Captain, he's fast!
<s> We know.
<s> What about you, Captain?
<s> Twenty-four-five.
<s> Because he's guilty.
<s> We have records.  We have proof.  I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse.  Now, if I were you, I would take that fellowship.
<s> Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
<s> Hey, sis.
<s> How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
<s> Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
<s> Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really.  If it's such a big deal, I'll go.  But remember this, it used to be fun.  It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you.  But I am not T-I-M.
<s> Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!
<s> The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
<s> What's a scam?
<s> Come on, it's graduation.
<s> Meaning?
<s> He'd like to start serving immediately.
<s> Alright.
<s> Okay.
<s> Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot.  But with that training out of High School gone, what's going to happen to us?  We all know what the answers are.  We want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family.  But what if that doesn't happen?  I have, I have to be honest though, I have all the hope and ambition in the world.  But when I think about the future, the truth is, I am really...scared.
<s> Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.
<s> Stop it, stop it, stop it.
<s> I just had a phone call.
<s> You won it.  You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.
<s> You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss.  You stand up straight and admit you're special.
<s> We'll worry about that later.  Now come on, tell me that you're special.
<s> Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
<s> Which they did, and every once in a while on a commercial, you can hear me scream.
<s> But I found the money.
<s> I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
<s> I'm so ashamed dad.
<s> You're right.
<s> Okay.  Oh, here's Ray.  Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.
<s> No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
<s> Yeah.
<s> It's the worst job since keymaster.
<s> I hereby surrender my duties as keymaster, give me a beer.
<s> Bye.
<s> Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
<s> Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
<s> Yeah, I've had it forever.  I used to have this thing with marking the words that I looked up.
<s> Come on.
<s> Really?  Um... I... well... you're really turning me around here,
<s> Okay, bye, I will.
<s> What did you say?
<s> Friends with potential.
<s> Am I wrecking my car?
<s> Oh.  I was putting the...
<s> Here are some blankets.  This is a good song, this is a really good song.
<s> Okay, how much time do you need?  I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions. 
<s> No, I don't, I don't.
<s> Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.
<s> I love you.  Please, I love you.
<s> So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
<s> Alright, personalised flight care from Corey.  Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
<s> Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
<s> You've gotta get her out of your head, man.
<s> He's back.  Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?
<s> Are you?
<s> Just knowing a person like that exists, knowing that for a minute that she felt that and wrote 'I still can't help loving you'. That's gotta be a good thing, right?  That's gotta be a good thing.
<s> Thanks a lot Lloyd.
<s> Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.
<s> Klaus Tauber.
<s> My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.
<s> I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
<s> It's a beautiful city.
<s> They're not gone, they're here.
<s> Yeah, what's that?
<s> It's good business.
<s> It's good for me - I know them, I'm familiar with them.  It's good for you - you'll be compensated.  It's good for the Army.  You know what I'm going to make?  Artillery shells.  Tank shells. They need that.  Everybody's happy.
<s> My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
<s> I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
<s> Yeah, I can.
<s> I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
<s> I've been here.  I guess I haven't been out.
<s> Yeah?  Yeah, that'd be nice, let me get my coat.
<s> Did I threaten anybody here?  I stated a simple fact.
<s> They should be.
<s> There's a machinist outside who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.
<s> Christmas presents.
<s> There's nothing you can do.  I'm not asking you to do anything.  You came into my office.
<s> Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.
<s> You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.
<s> No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
<s> Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
<s> They've broken their pattern.
<s> Alright, alright...I'll call you back.
<s> Stop it...
<s> Why aren't you there?
<s> I live here.
<s> Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.
<s> You could start with an apology.
<s> You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
<s> Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
<s> Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
<s> She dumped me.
<s> Sid, you don't have to.
<s> I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
<s> No, it's not.
<s> I really don’t like that comparison, honey.
<s> Tails.
<s> Meaning?
<s> That's not the way we play the game.
<s> I'm everywhere.
<s> Stay away from the cop.
<s> My morn was a Delta.
<s> I have to watch rehearsal.
<s> What?
<s> I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
<s> I counted four.
<s> Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
<s> You're not allowed to ask that.
<s> Thanks, Joel.
<s> He's after me.
<s> I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
<s> Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
<s> Melinda McGraw?
<s> Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . .
<s> Do I?
<s> You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
<s> I'm Gale Weathers, author of the Woodsboro and Windsor College murders, and anchorwoman for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT. Maybe you've heard of me?
<s> In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
<s> I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
<s> I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
<s> Mm, what a waste of Silicone.  What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.
<s> This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
<s> And who is that?
<s> Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
<s> Oh shit it's my cell!
<s> No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
<s> Good twist.
<s> Settle down Beavis.  Why don't you tell us the truth?
<s> Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.
<s> They're the ones who approved it.
<s> Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
<s> I know! He killed Kincaid!
<s> Let's get out of here!
<s> Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
<s> Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?
<s> Who's this?
<s> Roman that's not the line.
<s> I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
<s> W-what do you want?
<s> You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
<s> No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.
<s> Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
<s> Who is this?
<s> Who the fuck is this?
<s> Piece of cake. She'll be there.
<s> You know what time it is, Sid? It's after midnight. It's your mother's anniversary. We killed her exactly one year ago today.
<s> You sleep in THAT?
<s> See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
<s> Then what is it? Is there somebody else?
<s> So... I'm sorry. I've been a selfish shit and I'm sorry.
<s> Ssshh... everything's gonna be okay. I promise.
<s> It's okay. Give me the gun.
<s> I want to talk to you for a second.
<s> Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
<s> I told you not to hang up on me.
<s> More of a game, really.
<s> No...
<s> YES!
<s> Lucky, for you there's a bonus round. But poor Steve... I'm afraid... he's out.
<s> Your call.
<s> I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
<s> We're tracking the cellular phone bill.
<s> You never know when or where a story will break.
<s> I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
<s> Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
<s> I don't think you're so bad.
<s> Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
<s> Yes, you doofus.
<s> Hold up a sec...
<s> Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a little blow out -- we'll be perfectly safe.
<s> He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
<s> Yeah.
<s> How is everything?
<s> Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
<s> What about the cellular phone bill?
<s> Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know.
<s> Have you contacted the bureau?
<s> You think he could still be in town?
<s> The phone's dead.
<s> I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
<s> Have you talked to Cotton?
<s> That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
<s> Hello Sidney.
<s> Sleep tight, sweetie.
<s> Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it.
<s> Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.
<s> And what would be your motive?
<s> Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
<s> The official term is "psychotic".
<s> Peer pressure... I'm way to sensitive.
<s> What happened?
<s> Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.
<s> I'll be there by seven. I promise
<s> It was him, Tatum. I know it.
<s> You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
<s> I don't know, they just did.
<s> That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT.
<s> He wouldn't just turn himself in.  It doesn't make any sense.
<s> Everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible.  Also... this shouldn't be his first assignment.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> I can breathe withour pain now, so I guess I feel great.
<s> I'll see you.
<s> Who tied her down?  You or him?
<s> Why?
<s> Delusions of grandeur.
<s> We would have gotten you eventually.
<s> I seem to remember knocking on your door.
<s> It's close.
<s> Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile.  After that, we'll...
<s> You always have to find one singular thing to focus on.  There's always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck of dust, but you find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.
<s> All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
<s> Punishing.
<s> Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
<s> None.  Which I don't understand.  He had to get back out.
<s> Oh, that's all.
<s> He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
<s> Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
<s> I got him.  I got the son-of-a-bitch. See, I was doing really good up till then. Lots of street busts.  I've always had this weird luck... everything always went my way, but this was wild.  I got him with one shot... right between the eyes.  Next thing I know, the mayor's pinning a medal on me.  Picture in the paper, whole nine yards.
<s> They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
<s> No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.
<s> If you want to know who's been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau's computer will tell you.  It might give us a name.
<s> We need a warrant.
<s> Then, he must write about these murders.
<s> How can you say that?  Especially after today?
<s> You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.
<s> That part of me is dead.
<s> Big surprise.
<s> I can tell you this.  I recognize his lawyer.  His name's Mark Swarr.
<s> I can't let you do this...
<s> I don't see anything.
<s> It's a hard place.
<s> He mentioned it.
<s> Yes sir...
<s> He sure <U>is</U> goin'...He's sworn in.
<s> Why?  You wanted for a crime, Ethan?
<s> You fit a lot of descriptions.
<s> I thought we were trying to get the girls back -- <U>alive</U>...We jump those Comanches, they'll kill 'em...You know that!
<s> That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
<s> Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone...
<s> This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?
<s> Now mount up, son...
<s> Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
<s> Captain Clayton...Captain!
<s> Sir?
<s> JOINT action?
<s> You lie! All white men lie...and kill...
<s> Ay-eh...Made out I was crazy...  Ate dirt...chewed grass...I fooled 'em, Ethan!...an' I got away...
<s> You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
<s> <U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
<s> Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!
<s> Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
<s> No...nor build bonfires...nor beat drums neither. I'll meet you on the far side.
<s> Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
<s> Oh...
<s> Think it might be...?
<s> How should <U>I</U> know...She's YOUR wife!
<s> I ain't sure...Where's that doll?
<s> Over there!
<s> There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
<s> No...not yet...
<s> Who cares what he spells it? Read the letter.
<s> Ain't worth the mendin'...
<s> Finish your breakfast...
<s> You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
<s> Only if I'm dead!
<s> They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
<s> Oh, damnit!
<s> In the cellar, I think. Wait, I'll take care of it.
<s> We just have to make a new beginning.
<s> So do I, believe me.
<s> Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep.
<s> Oh, baloney.  You should just hear yourself talk!
<s> Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on!
<s> This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
<s> You don't remember?
<s> Ladies and gentlemen: The "Straub country-residence".
<s> I wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place.  You can afford to spend some money.  If I was you, I'd spare myself all the hard work.  Besides, didn't you want to start writing again?
<s> He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
<s> Lady?
<s> Twenty pounds on delivery
<s> It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
<s> A goodly length in times past, but lately
<s> By heaven, I thank you! I will be your Apothecary!
<s> A share of the profits.
<s> Yes, but very well.
<s> Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business
<s> The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?
<s> I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted to be an actor.  I am sorry, Will.
<s> Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
<s> We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.
<s> What? Who?
<s> The one who came with your letter?
<s> Good title.
<s> It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
<s> I will.
<s> "Madam!"
<s> Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
<s> Is she obedient?
<s> I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.
<s> I have to get back.
<s> The same, alas.
<s> Oh--I am him too!
<s> Can you love a player?
<s> I must. I must
<s> That's my line!
<s> I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
<s> I do not love you, my lord.
<s> It is to be expected on a Sunday.
<s> If you love her, you must do what she asks.
<s> Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom?
<s> Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!
<s> You are on my ground.
<s> Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
<s> Why, thank you, David.
<s> A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.
<s> But not quite.
<s> No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me.
<s> You're not eating.
<s> So I gathered.
<s> What?
<s> Oh, yes, it's great.
<s> Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?
<s> Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
<s> His car's still there.
<s> A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
<s> What?
<s> And now you tell me.
<s> OK.
<s> Who was it?
<s> Then let's spend some money.
<s> No, no, it's different.
<s> Don't you?
<s> Forget it.
<s> Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
<s> The perfect couple, I should say.
<s> What?
<s> I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
<s> Yeah, that's right, that's it.
<s> That wasn't a question.
<s> Did you ever kill a man?
<s> Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
<s> Yes. They're my friends.
<s> I should hope so.
<s> Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
<s> Exactly what I was --
<s> I'm boring?
<s> Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
<s> You must be Juliet.
<s> It's a breeze.
<s> Did he sound upset?
<s> It's an improvement.
<s> What?
<s> Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
<s> I mean, that's what it's like.
<s> Is it real?
<s> Chicken salad, Devra!
<s> It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
<s> Who?
<s> Why?
<s> I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
<s> What do you expect me to do about it?
<s> -- yes, we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in, believe it or not.
<s> Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
<s> Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
<s> But you don't know what happened.
<s> Calm down, baby.
<s> Whatever you say.
<s> Yes.
<s> I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
<s> Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?
<s> I guess so.
<s> Yeah.
<s> ... yeah.
<s> Why do you wanna know so bad?
<s> What would my being a faggot have to do with that?
<s> Have you ever made it with a girl?
<s> Yeah... I've made it with a girl...
<s> You don't have to make conversation with me, I'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it?
<s> Great.
<s> I guess not...
<s> Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
<s> No, thanks.
<s> Probably the bathroom.
<s> Yeah, I think so...
<s> Yeah... I mean great.
<s> Whew.
<s> Why not?
<s> And what?
<s> I know... you don't know, I know.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --
<s> Jackie, can we --
<s> Fuckin' A --
<s> You were great.
<s> Lester's on his way.
<s> It's too late...
<s> No, man.
<s> You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
<s> If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
<s> Wash her.
<s> Well, it's a big canyon.  Honey, I'm sorry but I've gotta get back... just for a minute.
<s> Fine. How are you?
<s> Yeah, baby.
<s> I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
<s> Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
<s> Where's your car?
<s> -- she's a very compulsive girl.
<s> I didn't want him meeting me here.
<s> I'm very tired, George.
<s> Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
<s> -- no, it'll help me, really --
<s> That's all you've got to say?
<s> What did you say?
<s> What did you say?
<s> Well, yeah.
<s> Yeah, little election party I'm giving at the Bistro. It's a pain in the ass but -- I have to do it. We'll have a little time to talk there.
<s> Okay.
<s> Oh yeah?
<s> Isn't that bad for it?
<s> But...
<s> I'm not anti-Establishment.
<s> ... how am I gonna tell you what they have against you? I mean Jesus fucking Christ, they're women, aren't they? Have you ever listened to women talk, man? Have you? Well I do, I do 'til it's fucking coming out of my ears. I'm on my feet all day, every fucking day, listening to women talk and you know what they talk about, don't you? Being fucked up by some guy. That's all that's on their minds. I'm sure you've done something they could get pissed off about, what's that got to do with it? All women are pissed off, man, all of 'em. They fucking hate us! Don't you know that?
<s> We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings?
<s> Yes I do.
<s> I... uh... I... uh... can't.
<s> I'll call you back.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Is that right?
<s> George is going to open a shop.
<s> Who do you think I was talking to?
<s> Then you were talking to him.
<s> Look... you do well for people, they don't ask you to stop. Nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all want their share.
<s> What's that?
<s> Fine.
<s> Oh, I'm sorry.
<s> See you later.
<s> -- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
<s> Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
<s> Well, there was this one time --
<s> -- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
<s> Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.
<s> My God, did I say that? I don't believe it.
<s> He's a hairdresser.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> George is a hairdresser, isn't he?
<s> You mean when are you going to Egypt?
<s> You're going.
<s> Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
<s> -- his car. They have it blocked.
<s> That's fine --
<s> Jill.
<s> No.
<s> I am, Dad.  Dad?
<s> Then why don't you go to sleep?
<s> I guess so.
<s> No, Dad.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.
<s> Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
<s> Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
<s> Danny, come on over here.
<s> Oh!
<s> if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
<s> Yes.
<s> Well how can I repay you?
<s> Great.  Sit down.  Oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
<s> A nigger.
<s> Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
<s> Sir, I've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there,
<s> It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
<s> Now I'm awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd, because I just happen to have two twenties and two tens right here in my wallet.  I was afraid they were going to be there until next April.  So here's what: you slip me a bottle of Bourbon, a glass and some ice.  You can do that, can't you, Lloyd?  You're not to busy, are you?
<s> It's good to be back, Lloyd.
<s> I guess we've been staying up too late.
<s> Yes.
<s> It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
<s> Which room was it?
<s> I can't really remember.
<s> Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
<s> Go away from me.
<s> Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh... 
<s> I'm intrigued.
<s> put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
<s> Oh, it's beautiful.  My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
<s> Oh well he sure did a beautiful job. Pink and gold are my favorite colors.
<s> Just like a ghost ship, huh?
<s> I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
<s> What kind of noises?
<s> And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
<s> What the hell does that matter?
<s> Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
<s> You want to know what I think?
<s> I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
<s> What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
<s> Yeah. Really. The bitch of it is, we still are. Learn from your elders, dearies.
<s> Well... thank you.
<s> Really?
<s> 'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.
<s> Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
<s> Today was the deadline, Vince.
<s> You said that?  And what did he say? Did he say you could leave her?  Did he say we'd be happy?
<s> You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
<s> I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours.
<s> Joey -- do it.
<s> Oh-huh.
<s> Because we're
<s> Get moving.  I'm right behind you.
<s> Whatever.
<s> Mary Robert.
<s> Tell me about it.
<s> You know?  About me?  About everything?
<s> Three years.  Sister.
<s> A novice.
<s> Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
<s> It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em over.
<s> This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
<s> Experience!
<s> A thank-you?  For what?  You're the one we should be thanking.
<s> Oh no.  We'll always be together.
<s> Enough joking.
<s> What? 
<s> Like to who?
<s> Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
<s> And whom would you call?
<s> Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
<s> How to put it... ah, Of course, Mary Clarence.  "No pain, no gain."
<s> Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
<s> A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
<s> And I am refusing.  As of tomorrow, Mary Lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
<s> I must go where I can be of use.
<s> Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
<s> Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.
<s> Don't push it.
<s> At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
<s> Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  Lottery tickets?  A travel iron?
<s> You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
<s> It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
<s> But Vince has contacts all over the place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll be looking for me!
<s> No -- worried about you.  Personally.
<s> No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about you.  And now... you've really changed.
<s> I think they'd understand.
<s> You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
<s> Vince is getting desperate.  Where is she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?
<s> We didn't tell you what?
<s> Willy -- hit the lights.
<s> Yeah, right -- when I see it.
<s> Forget her!  We got the one we need! Step on it!
<s> She's praying.
<s> Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.
<s> Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
<s> He's decent.
<s> Impossible.
<s> And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
<s> I know. 
<s> Well enough.  Your gathering does honor to the deceased.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> A diseased monster.
<s> You will stay at her side?
<s> Does that look like an animal hanging?
<s> I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
<s> Chosen me?
<s> More than enough, actually.  I beg you, no more, please.
<s> Is that all you say?  Look at her.
<s> My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.
<s> I know it.
<s> There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."
<s> Lady Van Tassel...
<s> Tired.
<s> Small talk.
<s> The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
<s> Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
<s> I insist that you have it.
<s> No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
<s> No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
<s> He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.
<s> The Horseman.  Yes.
<s> May I see my mother?
<s> If it works out and all, maybe we'll get you a key so you can get out at night if you need to. See you later.
<s> Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.
<s> Good to know you, Karl.
<s> Can I see him?
<s> Okay, stop back by. Don't worry about your boy here, he's doin' good.
<s> Give me the big'uns.
<s> How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
<s> Karl's my name.
<s> You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.
<s> Boy, ain't you somethin' else. Talkin' back and everything. It kinda makes me horny when you talk back.
<s> I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
<s> What?
<s> No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.
<s> What are you doin' with that damn hammer?
<s> It went real good.
<s> Would y'all like that?
<s> If y'all don't shut up I'm gonna go out of my mind. And plus you're liable to bust a spring in Karl's head. He's already off balance.
<s> This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
<s> Childers.
<s> How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
<s> Here give me the flowers, I'll do something with them. Thank you. Now you better go. Maybe I'll see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something. I have a boyfriend now you know. And we're pretty serious. He gave me a ring.
<s> I did live there in the state hospital.
<s> Yeah.
<s> My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
<s> You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
<s> Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.
<s> Hit was right thoughty of her.
<s> All right then.
<s> That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you?
<s> He ain't no count.
<s> My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
<s> I heared it cryin' a little through that box.
<s> I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow.
<s> Yes ma'am. I like a fried chicken leg.
<s> I've got a feelin' today.
<s> Okay.
<s> Nice to meet you, Karl.
<s> I don't know. He just said he'd eat out there.
<s> They ain't even no good. The only one can play is Randy Horsefeathers. He claims he's an Indian. His real name's Randy Collins and he works at the feed mill. He can at least play guitar.
<s> Did Vaughan go home?
<s> I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it.
<s> I reckon.
<s> He's a-carryin' me to look fer work in Millsburg where I was borned.
<s> No ma'am.
<s> Right now?
<s> Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
<s> Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.
<s> Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?
<s> Naw, not yet.  I want ye to give this to Mizz Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe there's a little somethin' to hep out. Hits what I've earned fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill Cox.
<s> Can I help you, sir?
<s> Yes sir.
<s> Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.
<s> Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
<s> We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.
<s> Why?
<s> Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
<s> Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
<s> Actually, I'm his father.
<s> I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
<s> Better make it charge. 
<s> Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
<s> I'd love to.
<s> I wouldn't think of it.  See you around, fellas.
<s> That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
<s> Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
<s> I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot.
<s> This is April Lee, Auggie. April, say hello to Auggie Wren.
<s> You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
<s> Uh, better make it one.
<s> You got it.
<s> Yeah, probably.
<s> Exactly. Life just wouldn't be worth living, would it?
<s> I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.
<s> Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
<s> It means "happiness."
<s> Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
<s> It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
<s> I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.
<s> Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
<s> I'm sorry, baby. I can't help it.
<s> I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
<s> Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp.  It's probably stolen anyway.
<s> Huh?
<s> I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell me to sweep, so I sweep.
<s> Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
<s> And these?
<s> What can I do for you?
<s> The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
<s> I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
<s> Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
<s> Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!
<s> And you told your nephew about it?
<s> I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
<s> I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
<s> And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
<s> Are you making fun of me? I won't be mocked. Do you hear me? I won't let no punk kid stand there and mock me!
<s> Tick-tock, tick-tock.
<s> I owe you something.
<s> You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
<s> You can't be more specific than that?
<s> Except that there's no bed, is there? And no breakfast either.
<s> But your body is in the world, isn't it?  If someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you?
<s> I'm not "people." I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?
<s> In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
<s> But then you don't get to watch the ball games. You told me you were a Mets fan.
<s> Yeah, I can believe it.
<s> Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it?
<s> I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
<s> I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
<s> Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
<s> The inspiration.
<s> I just did.
<s> Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.
<s> His only copy?
<s> I'm not going to do it.
<s> Yes, please.
<s> What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
<s> ...<u>might</u> do the same.  I have to warn you 'bout that, chief.  I'm not screwed together like I used to be.
<s> I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
<s> At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
<s> Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
<s> I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
<s> I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper.
<s> I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...
<s> And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
<s> Nossir.  I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.
<s> These are fishermen, Alvin.  They don't talk at all to each other and less to me.  Specially gossip.
<s> You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
<s> Pretty darn clear.
<s> I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person.  With a bloody gun- butt.  A right-handed fella, to be precise.
<s> Tht was summation, Your H...
<s> That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
<s> No, sir, I can't.  Not beyond a reasonable doubt.
<s> I had a spare battery in my shed. I brought it down, and put it in just before the sheriff showed up.
<s> It's public record.  If the public cares enough to read it.
<s> You're right.  I better use two.
<s> Because the second lantern, the one on the mast.  Was never found.  So we have to ask...
<s> He hit his head.  On the way in.
<s> I'll take two.  One for later.
<s> I was checking the cables.
<s> Sure.  Blood gets all <u>over</u> your hand, Sheriff, ask any fisherman.
<s> You mean, do I like to take the offensive?  Or hang back and wait.
<s> You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is <u>first</u>-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
<s> A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
<s> Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
<s> I don't think so.
<s> <u>Yes</u>, I'm sure.
<s> He had no reason to.
<s> That's all he said.
<s> Hey, she's ticklish!
<s> Of course I am.
<s> Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
<s> With you.
<s> So I had to rush him to the hospital and give him a transfusion...  Right?
<s> It's twelve bucks.  We can get one of the overcoats out of hock.
<s> You better come help me.
<s> But this is so humiliating.
<s> All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
<s> Of course, you're not.  I'm going.
<s> That's right.
<s> Security.
<s> We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
<s> That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
<s> No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve.  It's on the level this time.
<s> Terribly sorry.
<s> I'm Sugar Cane.
<s> Good night, honey.
<s> I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
<s> Isn't that ridiculous?
<s> Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
<s> Oh yes, we do!
<s> Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
<s> Yes.
<s> He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
<s> What's the big idea?
<s> Look, if William Morris doesn't come through -
<s> You don't say.
<s> Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand.
<s> They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
<s> Sorry.
<s> Pleased to meet you.
<s> Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.
<s> Oh, no!
<s> Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.
<s> Why?
<s> Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?
<s> Don't get me started on that.  Want a drink?  It's bourbon.
<s> I'll say.
<s> I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!
<s> Every time!
<s> About what?
<s> Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
<s> Good night, Sugar.
<s> I'll bet there isn't one of them under seventy-five.
<s> Saxophone player?
<s> Who are you?
<s> Well, I'm not.
<s> If it's at all possible -
<s> Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
<s> I am?
<s> It's not how long it takes - it's who's taking you.
<s> Of course.  On Thursdays, they always serve me in the small salon.
<s> Oh - a member of the herring family.
<s> They shrink when they're marinated.
<s> Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
<s> Oh, no!
<s> Talk about sad.
<s> I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
<s> All right - if you insist.
<s> It's like smoking without inhaling.
<s> Me?
<s> You see, we have those oil interests in Venezuela - and I just got a cable from Dad - the board of directors decided on a merger.
<s> What's what?  Oh, that.  just a little going away present.
<s> I know.  Every time!
<s> Where are they holding the wake? I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
<s> Go where?
<s> I cut myself shaving.
<s> Spats Colombo.
<s> Well, we all got to go sometime.
<s> What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
<s> No, Spats - no, no, no -  NO!
<s> There’s finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
<s> Oh, shut up and be happy. It’s always this or that. You’re never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.
<s> What? Why? What do you mean?
<s> Actually, I do.
<s> I’m not as square as my daughter thinks.
<s> No.
<s> Oh, shut up. You’re an optician.
<s> It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
<s> Well, it was a big deal. As late as...yesterday. Or this morning.  But not anymore.
<s> Exactly. I want us to look like we fit, but not like we’re trying too hard to look like we fit.  It’s welcome cocktails, not prom. With this level of matchy-matchy, we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere.
<s> I don’t do naked. My sister? She does naked.
<s> He was pretty drunk, but I think he’s still crazy about you.
<s> On the nose.  I tell you what, because you’re so cute, I’ll take care of our incidentals.
<s> Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
<s> I’m desperate to start but I don’t have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I can’t get enough of.
<s> Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
<s> It’s cute.
<s> A weekend?
<s> I have a friend at the magazine.
<s> My sixth-grade science project was entitled, “Love Hurts: The Heartbreak of Human Papillomavirus.” Trust me, I’m careful.
<s> We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.
<s> Oh, cut the crap!
<s> Spontaneously combust?
<s> Yeah.
<s> He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
<s> You’re judging me?! Oh, that’s a good one. You’re lying to me, you’re lying to your family, and you’re lying to yourself. But you’re going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
<s> Give it back? Are you nuts?
<s> Of course, don’t be silly.
<s> “...but it’s getting there. “
<s> Is he here in Borderdale?
<s> What he talk 'bout?
<s> You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
<s> But where is my daddy!?
<s> Yes, mam...
<s> Yes, Miss Johnson...
<s> She was dirty and wet...
<s> Yes mam...
<s> :HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
<s> "You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
<s> Naww -- he'll come back to you, soon as his wounds heal. This cake shore is tasty, son.
<s> We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
<s> I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone...
<s> Let me tell you somethin', boy! I don't care if both of my legs was cut off! I can do more work in that field, than you could in a hundred years!
<s> He'll be all right, Mama. I'll make him all right.
<s> No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
<s> Mama, don't I always do what you say -- every time I go to the fields to plant the corn, to Miss Boatwright's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and I do it, and you don't worry.
<s> It's the heat.
<s> Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
<s> Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
<s> Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
<s> No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.
<s> If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
<s> I don't know a damn thing, now stop bothering me about it!
<s> Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
<s> And don't wake up Josie Mae and Earl!
<s> I wanta see Nathan.
<s> I got to see my husband, Sheriff Young!
<s> Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
<s> The Canadians are just mad that we mothers here in South Park have the chutzpah to stand up to them!  Like it or not, Mr. Canadian Minister, OUR children are now safe from your Canadian smut!
<s> Montana.
<s> Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
<s> YOU DO?!
<s> Mom... When is the war gonna be over?
<s> Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
<s> Help yourself prickfuck!
<s> Young man, you will tell Peincipal Victoria THIS INSTANT where you heard all these horrible phrases!
<s> It's that v-chip thing that's inside you, Eric!  The polarity must have been reversed by the electric chair!
<s> No, what does that mean, find the clitoris?
<s> Baba mama!
<s> Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
<s> Mph rm.
<s> Aw, ma!!
<s> Dude, what the hell is going on?
<s> We already know what you did. We saw it on television.
<s> Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
<s> Uhh... Bacon.
<s> God? ...Let me tell you something about God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all.
<s> Sheet.  Did you bring ze mirror?
<s> Kay.
<s> Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that fucking song again.
<s> I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
<s> Yeah...
<s> I don't know, dude.
<s> Yeah, they suck.
<s> No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
<s> Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.  I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.
<s> He was killed doing something he saw in the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip... THEY killed Kenny.
<s> Huh?
<s> I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.
<s> <b>SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE!! UNCLEFUCKA!!! YOU'RE the one that fucked your Uncle, UNCLEFUCKA!!! You don't eat, or sleep or mow the lawn You just fuck your Uncle all day long!</b>
<s> The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?
<s> I know, Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.
<s> Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
<s> THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!
<s> Yup.
<s> Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
<s> Wow, I have a clitoris too.
<s> Cool!
<s> I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
<s> Oh Sara...
<s> It can't be.
<s> My...wings...
<s> Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
<s> There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
<s> Yeah yeah yeah, give me a minute here.
<s> Then we've got to get to the lifepods!
<s> Good help is hard to find...
<s> I know, I know.
<s> Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
<s> Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
<s> Actually I've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction.
<s> Still, I hope I behave on the moon.  I'll stick close to you.
<s> Just considering our options... sir.
<s> Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
<s> One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us.  Take this out of the equation right now...
<s> Helllp!
<s> A flare?  A flare won't do it.
<s> Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
<s> Marry you?
<s> Try not to think about it.
<s> I don't know.  Wave to them!
<s> Homesick?  It's only been two days!
<s> I'll tell you what you're gonna do.  You're gonna stay put like Taylor said.
<s> One moment please...  one moment please...
<s> Find your bowler?
<s> The pin machine?
<s> Lemme see your ball.
<s> I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
<s> La da da dalala...
<s> It was a clearance.
<s> Is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock? Junior looks from one man to the other, breathing heavily, his nostrils flaring.
<s> Only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out.
<s> A beautiful thing. And you know why Buzz? You know what we got? Buzz raises an eyebrow as he buttons his shirt.
<s> Theo.
<s> That game was before you was born.
<s> Theo! This is Sheila Kastle, my partner's daughter.
<s> What's it look like to you?
<s> That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.
<s> I didn't mean that stuff I said. I was trying to keep you out of this muddle. I'm glad I didn't have my tubes tied. Oh, and by the way, I made a call for you before I - uh - retired. Buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen.
<s> He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
<s> I was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks, he breaks my arm, tries to kill me. I swear man, the guy thought I was a pi–ata. If nobody else hadn't a been there, he wouldn't have stopped. He woulda killed me. Fuckin' guy man, just snapped. How do you like your burger?
<s> Who's there?
<s> Who's there?
<s> SHEILA!
<s> Someone wants to play with me?
<s> No!
<s> You know who I am?
<s> Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
<s> That's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ?  Now go take out your "big four", darling.  Come on, we're making her nervous.
<s> What ever happened to just bowling?
<s> Just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! I can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that.  Sheila and Kastle sit up.
<s> You keep that up Carmelita and one day you'll be a champion just like Mr. Skinner here. What do you think, Theo? Think Carmelita's got the stuff?
<s> He's my father, Millie.
<s> Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there for my dad. Everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad. Theo splits.
<s> Your dad's one of the only nice people in this fucking town. My Dad is slime. Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and shakes Kastle's proffered hand.
<s> When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had.
<s> Everything has it's drawbacks.
<s> So, what about you?
<s> We'll get into that later.
<s> I used to be kind of wild. They used to call me the bad boy of bowling.
<s> He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
<s> Sheila, please.
<s> I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
<s> Why not?
<s> It's Junior, isn't it.
<s> You don't have to do this. We could just cut out of here, go to Akron,  or anywhere else.
<s> I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.
<s> I'm looking for somebody.
<s> Dwarf bowling's illegal.
<s> Please, Dr. Levine.
<s> Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
<s> How about I just press the button?
<s> What are you -- his mother?  Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go.  Edmunds, the subs?
<s> Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear it.
<s> Nothing else.
<s> They didn't tell me anything.
<s> Hold on --
<s> No "buts".  If he wants to be left, we'll leave him.  Hello?  Yes, the subs -- I want a report...  Hello...  Yes, a report. Gimme... shit.
<s> I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.
<s> In a minute, sir.
<s> It's nonsense.  There's enough difference between our own species to prove that.
<s> Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
<s> Don't make stuff up, these emotional theories, just so you can feel important here.
<s> The sensors are picking up something outside.
<s> We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
<s> The timing has never seemed quite right.
<s> They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
<s> Yeah, why?
<s> You went through Edmunds' things?
<s> I would.  But my suit --
<s> You fixed this suit?  Beth?
<s> He what?
<s> Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
<s> But how?
<s> But why is he doing it?
<s> How do you spell it?
<s> You're not sorry.  You're scared.  You're a psychologist, Norman.  You pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you, not telling you the truth.  And now you're scared ... because you're not sure you can tell anymore.
<s> And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.
<s> Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
<s> Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
<s> C'mon --
<s> Hear what?
<s> Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
<s> Who says it's a he?
<s> For whoever's in that thing.
<s> I never said that.
<s> Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
<s> In time for what?
<s> Another attack?
<s> Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.
<s> Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
<s> You mean, you think I'm cracking?
<s> You don't understand about the sphere.
<s> What are they?
<s> I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
<s> When I woke up, nobody was here.
<s> Her suit's gone.
<s> I thought she was with you.
<s> You didn't say that about the food?
<s> Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
<s> Are you trying, damn it?  Just --
<s> Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
<s> Gimme some room here, will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space.
<s> That's right.
<s> But it's impossible.
<s> Please.  It must have flown here --
<s> Look closely.  That isn't writing. Those are grooves.
<s> See?  No code.  What'd I say?
<s> Thank you.
<s> It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer.  He'd run screaming "witchcraft".  And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics.
<s> Does this mean what I think it means?
<s> Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
<s> What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
<s> He's a pussy.
<s> You mean a picture?
<s> When he uses a phrase like "I am Happy", I think we should think twice about what we ask him.
<s> Not that I know of.  Why?
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
<s> Don't be so supportive, honey.
<s> Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
<s> You might get your stuff together. We'll be coming up on Organa Major soon.
<s> Well, I've brought you here.  What now?
<s> ... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
<s> Is that good or bad?
<s> There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
<s> But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...
<s> You mean I generate an energy field?
<s> Could I learn to feel it?
<s> But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
<s> Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
<s> I've got it blocked.  I'm all right.
<s> What's that?
<s> Was this trip really necessary?
<s> Chewbacca, it's time we showed them this isn't the regulation F8-88 Cargo Trawler.
<s> That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first.
<s> Why?
<s> They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
<s> Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
<s> We'll send a squad up.
<s> Who is this?  What's your operating...
<s> It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste...
<s> He'll be well cared for.
<s> I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
<s> I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
<s> For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
<s> Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
<s> I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
<s> Ace of spades.
<s> Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
<s> I got Games & Theory.
<s> The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
<s> Only when I give you an order.
<s> Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.
<s> Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
<s> You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
<s> So who's got time to get married ?
<s> Funny...
<s> I have good reflexes.
<s> Carl can wait.
<s> Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?
<s> How do I know if this is love ?
<s> Aw, you're in love with me... You just dont know it yet.
<s> I can't help it.
<s> I don't even know if you're my girl.
<s> I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service.
<s> Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
<s> I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write !
<s> I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.
<s> Should I be ?
<s> I like it. It's kinda...you.
<s> Thank you, ma'am.
<s> He requested a combat assignment. There's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. I had no choice but to let him go... He said you'd understand.
<s> Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
<s> I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
<s> You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
<s> Who gave you this idea ? It's that teacher. What's his name ? You know the one I mean.
<s> A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
<s> Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
<s> Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
<s> My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-
<s> He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
<s> Hey, just calm down, I'm giving the orders here-
<s> Uh, I don't know.
<s> What is it, Rico ?
<s> Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.
<s> Cover us, Ace !
<s> V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator.
<s> To join with him.
<s> Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
<s> V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
<s> The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose.
<s> It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
<s> It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
<s> Admiral, this is an almost totally new enterprise. You don't know her a tenth as well as I do.
<s> Permission to speak freely, sir?
<s> The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
<s> Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
<s> That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!
<s> V'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe, thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions. To fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension; V'ger believes this can be achieved only by joining with the Creator.
<s> Unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us, Captain! Directly ahead...!
<s> My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?
<s> Thrusters ahead, one third.
<s> That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
<s> Negative, Captain. I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
<s> Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.
<s> Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
<s> ... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
<s> 'Is this all I am? Is there not more?'
<s> High mag, Mr. Sulu!
<s> No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
<s> ... and then to reassemble itself <U>combined</U> with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.
<s> Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
<s> <U>Urgent</U> signal from Starfleet, Captain!  <U>All</U> Earth defense systems have gone dead.
<s> Who?
<s> I understand...
<s> Of course.
<s> Everyday things...yes.
<s> I love your script.
<s> Never saw the point of 'em.
<s> "Room Service!"
<s> Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
<s> You believe that?
<s> I used to go out with a politician.
<s> That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
<s> No.  You, I told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  And, I don't know, the movies, I don't know.  They should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?
<s> Sleep well?
<s> Yes...
<s> ...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
<s> ...the better to eat me with, your dear?
<s> I'm going to tell the truth.
<s> Morning, darling.
<s> Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...
<s> That's so beautiful...
<s> Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?
<s> Who is this person that you've found?
<s> Well, then, what's he doing here?
<s> Well, they don't always leave with the ones they came in with.
<s> Hope to tell you.  Didn't I pick the fragments of glass out of Bob Barrenger's actual head myself.
<s> That's what they call an events cluster. Some guy, nobby orders a Manhattan, fifteen, twenty years, allasudden, three times inna night.
<s> You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
<s> What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill...
<s> Waterford, Vermont.  Where is it?  <u>That's</u> where it is...
<s> That Could Be.
<s> What'll I do for fun?
<s> I <u>know</u> my lines...
<s> Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
<s> We've got three days to...
<s> How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
<s> Who is that...?
<s> Oh.
<s> Don't let me dis...I'll just...
<s> Is...Is the Movie!
<s> I...I...
<s> Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...
<s> I can't tell.
<s> She won't stop crying...
<s> Now:  the Waterford Merchant's Association, of who I am Council...
<s> What is the...?
<s> Yes.
<s> A witness to what...?
<s> The writer.
<s> Sure.
<s> "Suspicions of arson, these fires, believed set by a disturbed Teenager, were, in fact, the inspiration for the formation of..."
<s> You go in her room, take the lilacs from the water, dry them.  Go buy some cellophane, wrap em up, and get a card from <u>Marty</u>.  What's her problem?
<s> I have to talk to you.  My wife...
<s> You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?
<s> I can't write it.  I lost my typewriter.
<s> Well, you know, you know, that's a lie, I, I...
<s> He's got a date, he's got a date, is this guy fantastic...?  Already he learned how to write a movie, and he found a girl to get his toes curled, what a guy, what a...what a literary find...!
<s> You want me to lie.
<s> No.
<s> ...the house, the 1835.  The original <u>kitchen</u>, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
<s> A spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the Waterford Huskies...
<s> I left that for you.
<s> She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
<s> There's no witnesses...
<s> Would you, tell the guy, get the A.D., someone, somewhere where we can <u>get</u> <u>away</u>, something, I want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food.  You want...
<s> ...not the Lazyboy...
<s> I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
<s> ...the city council...
<s> Ain't no second chances in life.
<s> Givvem a cigarette...
<s> But, Wally, the window of the <u>firehut</u>...
<s> I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk.
<s> Mommy's marrying Rache!
<s> It happens.
<s> Like how?
<s> I'll be there for you.
<s> Like a big sister.
<s> You lied.  If you lied <u>then</u>, maybe you're lying <u>now</u>.  I can <u>never</u> belive you <u>again</u>!
<s> Where's Rache?  It's <u>Thursday</u>, we get to be with <u>Rache</u>!
<s> Oh, yeh.
<s> You cannot <u>believe</u> what he said, it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>Earth</u>!!
<s> Don't. Take me with you.
<s> I'll miss you so much.
<s> Here.
<s> I'm almost done making it.  Alright Ben -- <u>you</u> deal with the tardy, <u>you</u> write yourself a note, your daddy <u>told</u> you he had an important case this morning and he had to leave early and we were AAAAGGGGHHHH!
<s> He's badgering a witness.  Eat.
<s> You're just a <u>stepmother</u>.  So stop <u>bossing</u>, cos nobody's <u>listening</u>!
<s> Suits me <u>fine</u>!
<s> No, <u>his</u> mother's always on time.
<s> Oh.  It's an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie I'd never let you go to.  But it's real.  Does he have an older brother?
<s> He'll be impressed.  The clincher is, you <u>walk</u> away, then <u>whip</u> around...
<s> But Rache...
<s> Annabelle put down that camera.
<s> Fine.
<s> Annabelle let's get something clear.
<s> No!  You're cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise.
<s> How could I be?  We learned some magic...
<s> IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP.
<s> Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
<s> People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
<s> Yes...if you like big hair...
<s> Oh.
<s> You dying.
<s> Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
<s> No, it isn't.  Because it isn't everything.  And we want every- thing, don't we?
<s> Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.
<s> Have you still never told him?
<s> Sooner than later.  You really need to.
<s> But you're not <u>done</u>!
<s> Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.  There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...
<s> No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
<s> I'm here.
<s> You think I didn't get that?
<s> I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
<s> <u>Slugs</u>.  Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u>, even.
<s> Stop.  You're making me insecure.
<s> It's good.  You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you?
<s> I live or I die.
<s> But it's not on the schedule!
<s> I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
<s> Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
<s> I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
<s> I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
<s> Don't flatter yourself.
<s> How the hell would you know?
<s> Ironic, huh?
<s> Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
<s> Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.
<s> It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back.
<s> Is that what he told you?
<s> And she'll fight back again.  God help me, what have I done.
<s> No, there isn't.
<s> I lost him.  I was panicked.
<s> Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
<s> They don't hate you --
<s> I think so...What do you think?
<s> Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
<s> Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?
<s> I made that paella you liked. It's on the stove.
<s> That's not us.
<s> How about the promises we make to our kids?  About <u>their</u> future.  Do we shrug those off, just that easily?
<s> In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
<s> Hmmm...Do I know any...personally...?
<s> Even though it was only his cousins that were killed?
<s> Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
<s> No.
<s> I did not go to high school.
<s> We had to work. My family was poor.
<s> I'm still poor.
<s> I know!
<s> OK, you're right, you're right…  You know, we need to screen what we've got…invite some regular people, just some random off-the- street types…and see what real people think of this.
<s> Yes, Mikey?
<s> Fine.
<s> Oh. What happens now?
<s> Don't be so upset. It's OK...
<s> Tired of this shit...
<s> One in a million recover.
<s> OK!
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> Well, now you have.
<s> And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.
<s> I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
<s> Take off your top.
<s> Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
<s> C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
<s> Toby Oxman.
<s> Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
<s> Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out.
<s> I'm a documentary filmmaker.
<s> Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. What about you? I'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
<s> Three.
<s> It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet.
<s> I know.
<s> Yeah?
<s> No, thanks.
<s> Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
<s> So where'd you get in?
<s> I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies...Anything. I'd be willing to direct.
<s> Y-yes--
<s> Just the soda, please. Cooper heads down the hall.  Filmore watches him leave, sighs, then turns and smiles at the General manager:
<s> We're outta here--
<s> We don't have time!
<s> Used to Filmore, used to.
<s> There's the fence...
<s> Well Cooper...
<s> Even better.
<s> Are you going to kill us?
<s> It seems to me we are just sailing away. They haven't sunk us yet, have they? Besides, don't you worry your pretty little head about that.  It's all been taken care of.
<s> How much do they have?
<s> I know what I'm here for-you don't need to remind me.
<s> How much of this shit do they have, White!!
<s> Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the Doomsday Machine.
<s> That's right, fella.
<s> What?
<s> Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
<s> Now look here, Miss Pietraszkiewicz, this is Air Command Headquarters calling.
<s> To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
<s> Yes?
<s> I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
<s> Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
<s> I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
<s> You're right, sir.
<s> And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
<s> Because I thought it proper, Major.  Why else would you think I'd do it?
<s> Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
<s> Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.
<s> Zlat, make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices.
<s> Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
<s> I think they mean business.
<s> Yeah?
<s> Roger, I'm setting up the CRM-114.
<s> Hellnno, Major.  I was just trying to think the thing through.
<s> Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
<s> I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???
<s> Listen, give me a shot quick!
<s> Look, this is different.
<s> I don't get you, King.
<s> Take it easy, Major Kong.
<s> Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
<s> I tried everything.  Something must have gotten bent or twisted from the pounding we took.
<s> But how are we going to drop the bombs if the doors won't ---  Hey, King....you're not thinking of --- You don't mean you'd --- ???
<s> Well, I just wanted you to know how I felt. Hell, I know Air Command wouldn't have taken you if you weren't okay.  And don't think I don't know some of our best ball-players and entertainers are of Negro descent.
<s> But who would be chosen?
<s> Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
<s> It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me.
<s> Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
<s> Was it okay?
<s> Yes.
<s> Typical male.
<s> A cloud?
<s> Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.
<s> Needs some pizza in his diet.
<s> Buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead Bangladeshi.
<s> You wanna bet he's with a girl?
<s> Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
<s> No, no.
<s> No.
<s> No, no, I wasn't trying.
<s> No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
<s> No, I'm not worried.
<s> You know?
<s> Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
<s> Guess not.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Alright, Pony!
<s> I'm so burnt-out.
<s> Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
<s> This is private property, my friend.
<s> Yeah, we're just screwing around. Like Mohammed said. Can't take a joke, man? Hey, I hope you got a permit for that, mama!
<s> Glad it's okay.
<s> Good. See you later.
<s> Please.
<s> I could.
<s> I didn't want to eat this much, man.
<s> Okay.
<s> It's nice here. It's different.
<s> No, not really. Middle-class.
<s> Now, how the hell would you know what I think? Hm? You don't know me.
<s> Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
<s> Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
<s> Yeah, she, uh, works for the record company and takes care of interviews and, you know, shit like that, Uh, we were actually just doin' an interview and Erica said she's like to see Burnfield, so...
<s> Mm-mm.
<s> Yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in Turkey or India or wherever the fuck he comes from.
<s> Who were you talking to?
<s> Wow, that must be pretty nice there.
<s> No, wait, no, I thought about New York.
<s> Go look, man. Go look. Go see for yourself, if you got the guts.
<s> Wow. You did that for me?
<s> Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.
<s> Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
<s> What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just go home. Alright. Go home and sleep it off.
<s> That, that's Indian?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Nazeer Chaudry!
<s> It's a piece.
<s> You know, all you know is what's good for you.
<s> Typical male.
<s> Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
<s> Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would've done something.
<s> ... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
<s> Mm-mm.
<s> And I fig- and I figured something out.
<s> I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
<s> For a ride.
<s> Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
<s> No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
<s> Oh, no, no, no.
<s> 'Bye, Jeff.
<s> Just go.
<s> Yeah, really.
<s> You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! Come on! Come on, man! Come on!
<s> What are you saying?
<s> No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
<s> Hey!
<s> Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.
<s> Oh, no, man. I can't.
<s> Yep.
<s> Oh, my god!
<s> Yeah?
<s> "I sound like an idiot watching the parade I know there's no tomorrow only the charade I am dead Deep inside my head All the lies There's no then Only now I will love show me how"
<s> Erica? She said she was tired. She went back to the hotel.
<s> If you hit me...
<s> Oh that's nice for you.
<s> Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
<s> It's twins!!
<s> It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!
<s> So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
<s> Mmm-hmmm...
<s> Sorry.  My hands are tied.
<s> I'll just ask the question myself... "Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?"
<s> We're here for you, Diane.
<s> He is the Great One...
<s> Stop, you're gonna make me cry.
<s> Oh - okay, we ain't done with this... Those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load!  We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals!  I'm gonna visit my mom!
<s> Kim-Lo?
<s> You're kidding.
<s> Don't Martha-fucking-Stewart me!  If you don't like it - you try being a pregnant teen!
<s> I'll get them before "Touched by an Angel," don't worry.
<s> Maybe we can make a deal.
<s> Well technically, I don't think I'm a virgin anymore.
<s> Uh...maybe?
<s> Bank branch!
<s> So you need my help?  Oh my G-d, this is like asking me for help with your homework.  Hey, Mink, c'mere!
<s> More proof God's a guy...
<s> I hear she was a terror to work with.
<s> Don't worry.  She's just a fan for my literary output.
<s> I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
<s> Sure.  Bases Loaded.
<s> Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
<s> Phillip, you're mad!
<s> This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
<s> What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
<s> Second generation, huh?
<s> Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
<s> Twenty-two.
<s> I just don't.
<s> He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there.  It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
<s> Lady.  you've got the wrong man.
<s> I know your face.  You're Norma Desmond.  You used to be in pictures.  You used to be big.
<s> Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.
<s> Why?
<s> I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
<s> I'll take care of that.
<s> The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -
<s> Okay.
<s> Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
<s> I've lost my car.
<s> Tails.  That's ridiculous.
<s> There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
<s> "Mad about the boy."
<s> Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
<s> You're a darling.
<s> Maybe deMille is shooting.
<s> It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set.  Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
<s> Yes, Norma.
<s> You think I made that up about the gun...
<s> You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
<s> Goodbye.  Norma.
<s> I sure turned into an interesting driveway.
<s> Naturally.  I brought them myself.
<s> I just found out why all those tele- phone calls.  It is not Miss Desmond they want.  It is the car they want to rent.
<s> No?
<s> Yes.  Madame.
<s> Who?
<s> Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me!
<s> Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
<s> Thank you, Max.
<s> All right.  Camera!  Action!
<s> It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
<s> What is it?
<s> And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!
<s> There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother.
<s> It's a warning, that's for sure.
<s> It's for your own protection.
<s> I'm taking you to the hospital.
<s> Later.
<s> You love me?
<s> We have to have a long talk about all this.
<s> What do you feel about me?
<s> It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
<s> What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
<s> And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...
<s> I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
<s> What an adorable hat.
<s> And you think you're in love.
<s> This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.
<s> You can't escape from me that easily. I'm afraid you don't know who I am.
<s> Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
<s> Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.
<s> I've got things to do.
<s> Can I quote you?
<s> Did anybody notice you?
<s> It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.
<s> You're not...an orphan are you?
<s> Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
<s> But what for?
<s> Somebody's gotta do something!!
<s> Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
<s> What? Me?
<s> You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
<s> ...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
<s> Criminals.
<s> What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
<s> Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad.
<s> If there's a way in, there must be a way out.
<s> Going to try. Didn't say I could.
<s> Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
<s> Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
<s> It sure is.
<s> I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
<s> You know, I was just thinking, Lana --  -- someone like you could do do really well in Metropolis --
<s> Old ties are hard to cut.
<s> Can I help?
<s> Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.
<s> At one o'clock in the morning?
<s> Gus Gorman.
<s> Kitchen. . . Technician
<s> Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
<s> Yeah? What do you do with 'em?
<s> I'm tryin' to.
<s> Columbia.
<s> Destroy the entire Colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.
<s> Just the man I wanted to see!
<s> Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
<s> I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
<s> Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
<s> Join the party, genius! Come on up!
<s> Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.
<s> Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
<s> Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
<s> I'm in no rush.  So what do you have in mind?
<s> No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
<s> Diet soda?
<s> Where do you usually find a light switch?
<s> Gus?
<s> 53!
<s> You've got to pick three more numbers.
<s> Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
<s> Get a hold of yourself, Vera.  Nobody else ever will.
<s> Storms! Floods!
<s> Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
<s> It's your genius, pal! You built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.
<s> Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
<s> But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.
<s> Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
<s> Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
<s> Oh come on, that's ridic -
<s> Oh, hi.
<s> You're not selfish at all.
<s> Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.
<s> Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
<s> Wrong.
<s> How the hell would I know? I was in high school back in those days.
<s> Yes.
<s> Sensible enough.
<s> North.
<s> The son of Jor-El on this Planet?
<s> I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
<s> In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
<s> 		DELETE IN CUTTING
<s> What shall we do now?
<s> "Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.
<s> Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
<s> Don't worry, I've got you.
<s> . . . Let me get my purse.
<s> But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite.
<s> I'm sorry to see you go.
<s> It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
<s> Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . .  . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good nurse.
<s> Absolutely!
<s> Mr. White, come with me I want to see
<s> I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
<s> Who?
<s> Something . . . wonderful.
<s> But why the hair?
<s> My nephew, Leonard. He worships me.  Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last.
<s> Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
<s> Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?
<s> No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
<s> We're running out of smoke.
<s> Lois isn't here?
<s> He may have a gun!
<s> Huh?
<s> Don't you ever give up?
<s> It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.
<s> Superman.  Pretty good name for him, isn't it?
<s> You're not the only one.
<s> Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
<s> My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."
<s> I know that. Bu tin this case he was right. Arnold 'Buster' Luthor, the most inept check forger of his time --  A pity he didn't live to see his son strike out for the big city. A pity he didn't live to see how, from humble beginnings, I created an empire.
<s> Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
<s> You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
<s> What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too?  What's in it?
<s> First the pets, Otis.
<s> Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.,
<s> You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
<s> Ready.
<s> A night on the town instead of under it?
<s> Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!
<s> Lex is going bye-bye.
<s> You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
<s> This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection!
<s> If you persist, you leave us no choice.
<s> On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
<s> Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
<s> Enjoyed it?
<s> How good it felt!
<s> There are none of them any good anyway.
<s> It does, huh?  Clark Kent, I'd like you to meet Lois Lane.
<s> He is. Usually.
<s> Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
<s> There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
<s> I...uh...check.
<s> I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
<s> And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
<s> I will.
<s> No you don't.
<s> The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.
<s> Why?
<s> Do they have any reputation for drugs?
<s> Were his parents...attentive to him?
<s> Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
<s> Yes.  Abbot understands these things.
<s> Why would he be frightened?
<s> I'll...take it straight.
<s> No.  What's this lawyer business?
<s> It's the truth.
<s> That's what he said.
<s> What's a ditty again?
<s> Don't you usually like to sit at the back?  To wave at your Dad?
<s> Oh.
<s> I won't lie.
<s> Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
<s> So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that?
<s> I object to that form of question. Note that.
<s> Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag.  I know my wife packed one in there...
<s> Tell me about it.
<s> Why are you calling me, Zoe?
<s> Yes.
<s> No.  But this is.  They wouldn't take my blood.
<s> Yes.
<s> You can't ask me that!  Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted.  Not what I wanted it for.  I want money.
<s> Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.
<s> I love you, Zoe.  I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you.  No matter what happens.  I'll take care of you.
<s> What is it?
<s> No.
<s> Do you have this agreement with you?
<s> Any criminal record?
<s> Yes.
<s> And where did you sit that morning?
<s> Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
<s> Positive.
<s> No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
<s> Yes.  I do now.  Now that I'm telling it.
<s> Don't even try to remember.
<s> My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer?
<s> What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
<s> I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now. It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful rock star.  Not like you used to tell me.  Remember, Daddy?  All the people that were going to discover me?  Where are they now?
<s> You don't know that.
<s> It's compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead.  Sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
<s> Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!
<s> Hurry back.
<s> No, I wouldn't...
<s> No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
<s> Why?
<s> Did Sidney tell you about it?
<s> I'm taking up the situation with you now...
<s> J.J., Steve isn't...
<s> Yes, the Justice, that's right. But I think you had it in the column.
<s> Why not break it up yourself?  You could do it in two minutes flat.
<s> What you promised - do it!  Don't finagle around.  It's later than you think.
<s> No, I won't...
<s> No, that's the point - he won't accept your favor!  The manager yes, but not the boy.
<s> She knows now.
<s> He goes out with girls.
<s> Let's wait till Christmas - it's more legitimate then.
<s> That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...
<s> One of those business meetings, honey - always coming up in the middle of the night.
<s> And he's a perfect stranger to me.
<s> Nothing I didn't think of you before.
<s> But what?
<s> The renting agent and the tailor.
<s> Nothing...
<s> Well, thanks, anyway - let's forget it.  It's cold out here, Susie.
<s> Why not you?
<s> - and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.
<s> Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr. Falco.
<s> But I don't need an uncle, Sidney.
<s> ...but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic.
<s> He's intuitive - he knows he's getting fired!
<s> But he isn't going to like this, Susie.  And he makes you nervous, not me.  No, I take that back - he makes me nervous, too.  But I wouldn't give him a second thought if not for you.
<s> Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
<s> Not what you're doing now.  At least don't ask me - don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do?
<s> I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net processor.  It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature. Other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  But why is that so goddamn important, Miles? I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm going crazy here, sometimes.
<s> I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
<s> Anything it samples by physical contact.
<s> Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
<s> Chill out, dickwad.
<s> No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
<s> Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.
<s> Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt?  Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally, of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye.
<s> You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
<s> No problemo.
<s> I don't care!! There's gotta be another way. Haven't you learned anything?!  Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?
<s> Where'd you learn all this stuff?
<s> But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
<s> Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.
<s> There's not much time left in the world, Sarah.
<s> There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move!
<s> Open the goddamn door!
<s> Respect your elders and your betters!
<s> Eating is eating... and...
<s> For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
<s> I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
<s> Five minutes.
<s> Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down, Emmi. We're going to keep him waiting, too.
<s> Could I have a glass of water, please? Please, Fraulein?
<s> May I ask a question?
<s> I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
<s> Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?
<s> It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me.
<s> They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave.  I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German.  I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?
<s> Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
<s> Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as Privy Councillor or Vice-President.
<s> No!
<s> You like the women, don't you, Wilhelm?
<s> You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?
<s> The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
<s> How could I forget?
<s> He did?
<s> No. But you will.  It's very important that you live.
<s> I don't understand...
<s> It's okay.  Forget it.
<s> You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.
<s> I want it to be over for you.
<s> No.  Never.
<s> Ticklish?
<s> SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
<s> Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
<s> Six shots at less than ten feet.  Weapon was a large caliber--
<s> Your father was a friend.  Goddamn it... I watched you grow up.  How do you end up treating me like this?
<s> You could.  But, if I leave without your signature, this agreement begins to disintegrate; benefits shrink, options narrow, compensations shrivel.
<s> Please, don't do that...
<s> A bad month.  You did the exact same thing to me last week.
<s> It was an accident.
<s> What's going on?  I'm going on my second job this month, and now I'm going on unemployment.
<s> I don't think he's breathing.
<s> What... is... happening... ?
<s> You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
<s> How do you know that's the way?
<s> Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
<s> You first.
<s> You pull me up.
<s> No.
<s> What's C.R.S.?
<s> If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
<s> Can we talk?
<s> You?
<s> Get out of my car!
<s> I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
<s> Nicholas...
<s> Who's responsible?!
<s> Shut up!
<s> Stop it!
<s> Like... where are you from?
<s> Single?
<s> "Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.
<s> Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
<s> Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
<s> Yeah.
<s> You shouldn't have.
<s> "Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
<s> I'll call them, okay?
<s> I'm going to call.
<s> No.  Do you?  Can't be too hard, can it?  I don't think we should be here out in the open like this.
<s> You're part of it...
<s> Oh, God yes please.  Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
<s> I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
<s> You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
<s> You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
<s> I'm tired of dealing with peons.  I need to get to whoever's in charge.
<s> No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...
<s> What whistle?  There's no fucking whistle.  This is fucking dangerous.
<s> I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.
<s> It was a different floor then...
<s> Like, this way... sort of...
<s> I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
<s> The key?
<s> No, you didn't...
<s> There's been a break in.  Lock this door and stay here.  Don't move a muscle.
<s> I'm not sure.
<s> No.
<s> Is Alan Baer "the Game?"  Is that what this is?
<s> Follow me.
<s> Nothing else?
<s> You're joking.
<s> Sam...  Thank you.
<s> What?
<s> Sure.
<s> Why?
<s> Go ahead.
<s> Do we still get paid for the week?
<s> Just stay there, Nell!
<s> Watts.  Those were his keys Nell found.  His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to.  I think he's here.
<s> Nah, you're going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it's worse than a nightmare. --
<s> He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
<s> Mary, I'll meet you outside.
<s> No, but she does, and that's all that matters.
<s> Test it.
<s> Good morning, Theo.  Luke.
<s> Nell, what do we do?
<s> I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up.
<s> That's a good question.  What is it about fences?  Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  Why would that be?
<s> That's why we're here.
<s> I guess.  Oh, your hair!  It looks good.
<s> Maybe you did it yourself.
<s> I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.  Maybe he did it...
<s> There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
<s> I don't know, you know...
<s> Then let's go get you one.
<s> Like you.
<s> What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
<s> What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
<s> Let him break - he likes to break.
<s> Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my own home.
<s> It was better than a telegram.
<s> Huh?
<s> No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that.
<s> I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside.  There was no moon that night ...
<s> No, not my girl.  Self-control, she had. Point of pride.  And people don't change, do they.
<s> Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing machines, you know.  Bung in your coins, come out with a .44 Magnum, fully-loaded.
<s> Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
<s> Not me, man.
<s> They look a right load of wallies. Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' Household Cavalry.  Watch it.
<s> That would be too easy.
<s> What post office?
<s> You look alike.
<s> Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
<s> If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?
<s> Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
<s> He give me your address.
<s> My employer.
<s> This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.
<s> You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
<s> It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.
<s> He alive to see this?
<s> You sound like my fucking probation officer.
<s> Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right.  So there's no need to get out of your pram.  I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this.  Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me.  I don't wanna know.
<s> Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.
<s> No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
<s> All of what?
<s> Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
<s> My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
<s> Unless I'm not who I think I am.
<s> I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back.
<s> Where else?
<s> But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
<s> The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
<s> I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
<s> What are you doing here?
<s> No trouble.
<s> Who's looking for you?
<s> Tell me.
<s> Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good.
<s> Hello, Tony.
<s> Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
<s> Look, I'm no expert, but--
<s> Huh.
<s> But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
<s> That right.
<s> No. I--tell me--
<s> Sure.
<s> $10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
<s> Honey?
<s> You don't have to tell me anything.
<s> I took Doris's keys.
<s> And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money...
<s> OK. Boy. Jesus!
<s> Huh?
<s> Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie...
<s> ...Nah.
<s> Hello.
<s> Hey, what's your problem, friend? This is a business establishment with posted hours--
<s> Ah.
<s> Not an owner.
<s> Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
<s> I'm in.
<s> It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.
<s> Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan.  Move.
<s> If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
<s> I don't want to scare people.
<s> Where's the walk-in safe?
<s> Hurry up!
<s> What's left of it.
<s> Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
<s> Then you won't like this one.  It's a piece of shit.
<s> This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things.
<s> I know.
<s> All right everybody, hold up!
<s> Dr. John Whittlesley.
<s> Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
<s> Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  The museum is in debt.  Contributions and public funding have dried up.  Admissions no longer cover overhead.  The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
<s> A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff.
<s> It's like ringing the dinner bell.
<s> They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta.
<s> Don't be a wuss.  Come on.
<s> What is it?
<s> They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
<s> Heel Argo!  Hobbes!  Heel!
<s> Holy mother, what is that?
<s> Come on.  Let's get back to the others.  We can't leave them alone.
<s> It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
<s> Eats them?
<s> You were afraid of him, weren't you?
<s> All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.
<s> Gone.
<s> It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
<s> We have the fibers.  Don't you see? The creature is hungry.  It wants the hormones in these plants.  It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers.  We're just a poor substitute.  To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.
<s> What are you going to do?
<s> Oh God!  Help!
<s> It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
<s> Why would we--
<s> --a dead one at that.
<s> That and a fat, new contract.
<s> Amnesia.
<s> As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.  I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.
<s> A window onto the human condition?
<s> We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.  As the show expanded, naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep Truman in Seahaven - demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk.
<s> Let's take another call.  London, England, you're on "Tru Talk."
<s> I'm the creator.
<s> You're the star.
<s> Shhh!
<s> Yeah?  Outta what?
<s> So when are you leaving?
<s> --Truman, what are you doing here?
<s> So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?
<s> They're...  perfect.  Thank you.
<s> Maybe I feel like a teenager.
<s> I'm sorry, I'm late.
<s> You hate gambling.
<s> I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.
<s> Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
<s> You're welcome, Truman.
<s> Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
<s> Yup.
<s> Yes.
<s> Brought on by what?
<s> No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
<s> Looking for him for what?
<s> Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
<s> I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
<s> S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
<s> Not according to the men in blue.
<s> Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.
<s> Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
<s> I'm not sure. A virus --
<s> A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
<s> Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
<s> I think they have that covered.
<s> What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome.
<s> No you didn't.
<s> Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.
<s> I was until about an hour ago.
<s> I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
<s> Get dressed, Scully.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Mulder --
<s> I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
<s> I don't know.
<s> Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
<s> Where are we?
<s> I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
<s> Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
<s> I'm not taking any chances.
<s> I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg.
<s> The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.
<s> In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!
<s> No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
<s> Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.
<s> Lucien Baines?
<s> I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
<s> A pocketful of fucking rye.  What's wrong?
<s> I don't need them anymore...
<s> Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
<s> Give a kiss to Edward.
<s> You don't know the procedure.
<s> The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it.
<s> What did you see?
<s> You're the shrink, you tell me.
<s> This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore.  Not to him.  He never finished her.  The others...he was able to make them his.
<s> What happened to Charles Gish?
<s> Like hell "wait."
<s> Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine.
<s> All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
<s> I think that's the whole point.
<s> What's wrong?
<s> Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good.  I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.
<s> Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.
<s> Nicole Labetzki.  Victim seven. Forensics found dog hair in her car, but they had a K-9 unit at the scene and never had it checked.
<s> Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company.
<s> I don't have to.
<s> I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
<s> I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz - do you know him?
<s> I was told there were only two men there.
<s> The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen.
<s> Dr. Winkel.
<s> Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
<s> Just another part I've got to learn.
<s> We're both in it, Harry.
<s> I'm so sorry.
<s> What are you going to do?
<s> I don't know.
<s> Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
<s> Oh, the usual things...
<s> Thank you.
<s> And my passport?
<s> We loved each other, do you mean that?
<s> I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.
<s> Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
<s> Fellow called Lime.
<s> When did you see him last?
<s> Best thing that ever happened...
<s> It wasn't petrol.
<s> Do you mind if I use that line in my next Western? You can't chuck me out, my papers are in order.
<s> In Vienna...
<s> You all did.
<s> Oh, Mr. Martins...
<s> Listen, Mr. Martins, if you'd agree to be our guest, we'd be delighted to have you.
<s> No, a major, were you really?
<s> It is, and I'm gunning just the same way for your Major Callaghan.
<s> Yes, Hindu dances, thank you, Sergeant. This is the first opportunity we've had of making an American author welcome.
<s> She's been arrested.
<s> I told the police.
<s> What do you want?
<s> A Roumanian.
<s> Yes.
<s> I have guests waiting.
<s> I understand...
<s> Must be some mistake.
<s> Not the sort of thing I should confess to a total stranger, but you have to break the rules sometimes. Humanity's duty.
<s> What else?
<s> Oh.
<s> A friend of mine offered me a job here.
<s> With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
<s> Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
<s> That's the wrong one.
<s> So?
<s> What!
<s> It was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning.
<s> No.
<s> There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.
<s> I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.
<s> He's an asshole.
<s> Who the fuck are you?
<s> We'll go to the country sometime, okay?
<s> Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
<s> Disease? What disease?
<s> You can't.
<s> No.
<s> Why not?
<s> Good question. Both.  Aleph...
<s> It's silent. It holds a place, takes a vowel. The vowels are little dots that go under the letters.
<s> No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.
<s> It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews.
<s> Is it like Eichmann? Are we goofing?
<s> You eat first, then you light.  Once you light, it's Yom Kippur, which means you're fasting, so you can't...eat.
<s> I doubt it. How did you find out?
<s> Who's Eichmann?!!?
<s> A poison...?
<s> I don't know. Is that right?
<s> Female...
<s> Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
<s> He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
<s> It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
<s> You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
<s> That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
<s> I was going to ask you the same thing.
<s> That's meat.
<s> Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.
<s> No, it's...yeah, it's true, but... how'd you get this number?... No, not here... Maybe Sunday? There's a place off Queens Blvd. Near the courthouse...
<s> A Jewish prayer.
<s> You could do it.

<s> Green dot -- shotgun powder. For pipe bombs.  A guy in a lumberyard gave it to me. A donation to the cause.
<s> You said they didn't have night guards.
<s> JTS...?
<s> I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
<s> Wow, that's uh...great...
<s> I was a Jew in a previous life.
<s> I didn't. I told you, I can't --
<s> Dennis Leary.
<s> Danny, please, we don't want to know.
<s> EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
<s> As you know, Cindy, thirteen is a mystical number in the Jewish faith. We believe that God has thirteen attributes...
<s> None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
<s> I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?
<s> Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
<s> ... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
<s> But your man isn't quite a God!
<s> What d'you mean?
<s> I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
<s> It's the Free Diving World Championship.  I am by the way world champion!
<s> What was he like, when he was little?
<s> No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
<s> The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?
<s> The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
<s> What does that mean?
<s> Then tell him to wax it too.
<s> A rosary for Mama, a dress for
<s> Find the Frenchman.  Find me Mayol.
<s> Eh?  Si!  Avanti!
<s> You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
<s> No...
<s> You don't have a room?  Paolo?  What did I just hear?  I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
<s> I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions.
<s> How do you make a living?  Your experiments, does it pay well?
<s> Ahi, ahi, cazzo!  Ma mamia! Where...?  God, she'll kill me...  ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.
<s> ... And his friend, Johana...
<s> Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
<s> Everything about what?
<s> Look at me.  These aren't lungs. These are... Tanks.  How long can you hold your breath?
<s> You don't need a stretcher to take her with you.  You know that, don't you?
<s> I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
<s> Thank you, thank you very much!
<s> We saw each other a little while ago.
<s> I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
<s> Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
<s> I don't know... it didn't feel right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired.
<s> No, I'll be fine.  Can you just hand me a glass of water?
<s> Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.
<s> ... Are you sure?
<s> Don't be a jerk.  There's no such thing as love at first sight.
<s> They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
<s> That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
<s> How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?
<s> His mother's an American.  He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
<s> Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
<s> Then, goodbye.
<s> It's Esther. Santa's got her.
<s> What do you want me to do?
<s> Sure. Why not.
<s> Kiss me you Semitic stud!
<s> Oh, she said that, did she? What else did Mommy Dearest have to say?
<s> I'm sorry Esther, I just don't think we can see each other romantically anymore.
<s> I forgive you.
<s> Mom, stop with this already. Of course I love you. You're my mother.
<s> Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?
<s> ...So you saved Hanukkah Mr. Big Shot. I mean, let's be honest Mordechai, it isn't even one of the high holidays.
<s> If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
<s> I don't have to tell you anything Hammer! You're gonna have to kill me before I tell you!
<s> While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.
<s> No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
<s> Who's Carlos Dom-what's-his-name?
<s> I don't know —-
<s> I drink.
<s> You really think so, Charlie?
<s> They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
<s> Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
<s> Let me see it ——
<s> I suppose so. I suppose it will be different for us, too —— when everyone knows. Then we will be just like other people.  But these last weeks will always be our secret —— a lovely secret to remember all our lives.
<s> You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
<s> I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it "fits just perfect."
<s> You're worrying about its killing someone else?
<s> Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question.
<s> Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
<s> Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
<s> I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight ——walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
<s> No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
<s> Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
<s> Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
<s> Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
<s> What! You can't be --
<s> Ain’t nobody out there, Mister.
<s> You a tourist?
<s> The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
<s> How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
<s> Why... I don’t know what you’re talking about.
<s> I guess the news you’d sent me after Friedman didn’t go down too well, eh?
<s> You knew he had nothing to do with your brother’s disappearance, didn’t you?
<s> ...You-you spoke to him?
<s> You bastard...
<s> Something like that.
<s> Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. That’s when he hit me, and told me he’d killed my brother... “You don’t know what you’ve done,” he said.  “We’re in deep trouble,” he said. “We,” he said. “We.”  We’d both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...
<s> What are you doing? You can’t. I...
<s> I’m fine standing, thank you.
<s> A small loan would be welcome. More urgently, I need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me.
<s> Well, I’d sooner mug an old lady...
<s> I wouldn’t mind. Thank you.
<s> Thank you. But I think I’ll go to bed. It’s been a long day.
<s> That-that won’t do. That’s not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, that’s the way...
<s> It’s up to you whether they walk or not.
<s> She’ll be alright. She’s tough...
<s> What about an untrained pup, white...
<s> No... No...  I swear...
<s> I certainly did, sir...
<s> How are you, Jane?
<s> It’s Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
<s> Well, I hope you’re not too heartbroken and...
<s> I hope it’s not too significant.
<s> Look Mrs Spitz... I don’t know to whom I’m indebted for the recommendation but... I’m not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
<s> You wouldn’t be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
<s> Do what, Mr Lombard?
<s> Then you should not have sought an explanation.
<s> He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
<s> Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
<s> Plus a trust fund to provide for the boy’s education.
<s> Who are you? Who are you working for, huh?
<s> Questions can amount to revelations. Now, I’d hate to think I was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination. Mr Friedman led me to believe we had a deal. Do we?
<s> I’ll be alone.
<s> Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
<s> Should I be?
<s> Can I get up now?
<s> Haven’t you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? I’d have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
<s> Oh, I... She just moved. I’ve got her new... It’s in my book in the kitchen. Wait... Thank you.
<s> He... Apparently the hostility was all hers. Leon didn’t... It hurt him. They used to be close...  Their parents were in their forties when they were born, you see. And mostly away. They grew up in a Scottish mansion with old nannies and servants. He... “Our world was so old and cold, we shone for one another,” Leon used to say. His sister cut him off after she got married. He never understood why but thought it was because she had no children. Was bitter...
<s> I... How long have I been here?
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> Could that be Camden Market?
<s> Fucked-up fucking weird.
<s> Cinq cents.
<s> A l’achat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais ça pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. C’est pas vraiment mon truc.  I don’t know any Austrian, Xavier.
<s> Who?  I don’t know who the fuck you’re talking about, sunshine.
<s> Huh! You turned him into a liability, didn’t you know?
<s> I can only tell you what he told us...
<s> Shut up and walk...
<s> Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasn’t easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, what’s your business with these Spitzes?
<s> Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, I’d watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The lady’s also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
<s> I don’t know. Could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?
<s> That's a good idea, sire.
<s> So... pretend it's not a game.
<s> Yes, my lord.
<s> We have to do something before she tries it again!  I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...
<s> Jeanne, no...
<s> But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.
<s> You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
<s> Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
<s> To marry you.
<s> It would not be the same without you.
<s> You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
<s> I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
<s> And so I... I prefer my banner.
<s> We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
<s> Where... where am I?
<s> Nineteen... or thereabouts...
<s> These questions have nothing to do with your trial.
<s> Not long ago...
<s> Last night.
<s> Silence her!  Take her away...!
<s> Buying her?
<s> You think?
<s> ... You look wonderful...
<s> Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
<s> She says she'll be here tomorrow...!
<s> Go on to the next question.
<s> I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow.
<s> Everywhere.  Where is the food?
<s> He's on the other side of the river.
<s> You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
<s> God.
<s> Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
<s> Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
<s> No good?  This is a disaster!
<s> I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
<s> But my voices... they promised me...
<s> The clothes are not important...
<s> It was just... more convenient as I was among soldiers...
<s> That's now what I meant...
<s> I know, but that's not the way things happened...
<s> That's different... I mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause!
<s> I'd sooner die than use magic!
<s> Yes... a half-steed... white.
<s> No.
<s> I might ask you the same question.
<s> Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
<s> Yes... lots of things!
<s> Oh no?  How about this one?
<s> Really?
<s> I need to confess.
<s> I need to confess again.
<s> There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
<s> Whose were they?
<s> Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
<s> Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
<s> Why did she have to die?
<s> A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
<s> Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
<s> That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
<s> I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr--  -- a Mr Dzikiewicz.
<s> Christmas.  This is not a good time to have children. But then...
<s> Let's find out.
<s> Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them?
<s> Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
<s> But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
<s> What d'you mean, take the table away?
<s> Warsaw's not the only radio station.
<s> That makes a change.
<s> No. Three hundred and sixty thousand, so it'll be easy.
<s> Three lousy zlotys. And there are people here making millions.
<s> Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
<s> They were taking you away.
<s> I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
<s> Cow!
<s> You're a dirty pig!
<s> I was listening, Kitten.
<s> If you need help...
<s> You made contact?
<s> Where are we going?
<s> Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
<s> God forbid!
<s> In the attic.
<s> The Russians. On the other side of the river.  All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.
<s> Not yet.
<s> Don't thank me. Thank God. It's His will that we should survive. Well. That's what we have to believe.
<s> Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
<s> Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
<s> No, no they know another track - to the side of this.
<s> I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
<s> I'm sorry, I can't do that.  I don't have the time.  Goodbye
<s> I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
<s> She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled
<s> Hah, you're very cunning Ada, but I've seen through you, I'm not going to lose the land this way. Wait here!
<s> Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here.
<s> Billie.  You ready?
<s> Don't worry, we got the wallet. What happened?  He get ya with the knife?
<s> Good, have 'em down at Stenner's old Pool Hall before 3:00.  We're gonna run through the route tonight.
<s> Don't worry about it, pal.
<s> What?
<s> But you played the Big Con.  You said it was nothin'.  A game for flakes and mama's boys.
<s> You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?
<s> If that's the way you want it.
<s> Which one?
<s> Yes sir.
<s> What do ya want the others to get?
<s> Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
<s> Then you'll do it?
<s> If we ever get to it.
<s> I thought I'd lost him.
<s> We'll give him the hook on the train, and play him here.  You think I can get in that poker game, Eddie?
<s> Nothin' yet.  I got a good one on the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'.
<s> What!  Don't give me that crap you little weenie.  How do I know you ain't gonna take a powder.  You come to a game like this, you bring your money.
<s> You're more gutless than I thought.
<s> No.  What's wrong with the front?
<s> I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
<s> All you gotta do is place a bet for me at Shaw's place.  I'll supply all the money and the information.
<s> You're a lucky man, all right.
<s> You got a system, Carver?
<s> How am I gonna do that?
<s> We'll get it, and if we can't, we'll just make it up.  Grand larceny, extortion.  Counterfeiting, anything you want.
<s> No.
<s> Not if you want me to keep makin' 'em for ya.
<s> We missed him.
<s> Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
<s> Come on, gimme a break.
<s> No.
<s> Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
<s> I can't find him.  I've tried everything.  I thought you might know.
<s> He's just around the corner.
<s> Nothing.
<s> Dorothy!
<s> I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
<s> I'll do nothing of the sort.
<s> There!
<s> Thanks...  we're taking your cab.
<s> He wouldn't say.
<s> Yes.
<s> Which way did she fall?
<s> He's been dead for three months.
<s> Forgive me.  How are you?
<s> He's all right.
<s> Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
<s> He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
<s> Not a thing.
<s> Gilbert!
<s> What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
<s> Who's your candidate?
<s> They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
<s> Fifty will still get you a hundred.
<s> Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
<s> Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
<s> He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
<s> This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
<s> Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
<s> Good.
<s> That's all right.
<s> I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.
<s> That's all right.  What are you drinking?
<s> What about it, Tanner.  Isn't that the truth?
<s> Yes...
<s> He's all right. He'd like to see you. But listen...  What's the law doing to me?  Do they think I did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?
<s> That'd be very smart.  That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument.  The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.  They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.
<s> I had him out this morning.
<s> What are you drinking?
<s> There's nothing I can do to help her.
<s> You'll have to keep them anyway. The man at the Aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back.
<s> Want a drink?
<s> It's not going to hurt me to get up.
<s> Maybe I will.
<s> I don't believe he did it.
<s> He was down in the shop.
<s> Hey... hey.  Don't do that.
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
<s> Police!
<s> Maybe she has.
<s> Oh, yes -- yes -- that's right -- 
<s> There you go, Jaeger.  Just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire.
<s> Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.
<s> I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
<s> Low on gas.  Got to refill.
<s> And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.
<s> Basically.  But the map has been pretty precise so far.  I don't think it'll be too hard to--
<s> All right.  I'll go up, then you send up the gold and--
<s> You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
<s> He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
<s> How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.
<s> You don't know that.
<s> He's an enemy soldier.
<s> We're at war.
<s> It's murder, and I won't be any part of it.
<s> What about Jaeger?
<s> Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
<s> I did it!  I got the box open.
<s> Yeah, that's exactly what I think.  You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes.  Let's get out of here.  We got sand to protect.
<s> Wait.  Wait.
<s> Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
<s> Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this stuff.
<s> Wh-what do you think--
<s> We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
<s> Millionaires, man.
<s> I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.
<s> Me and Wes are just going to talk.
<s> Epps, my leg is falling asleep.
<s> You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!
<s> Someone's got to send the gold up.  It can't get on the line by itself.
<s> It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.
<s> We'll find our way!  We'll...
<s> We need something:  A flare, a signal mirror.
<s> I'm not like Wes.  Wes was crazy.
<s> Epps.  What if they're not Saudi.
<s> They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
<s> Thanks.
<s> We'll make up some kind of lie.  They won't find the gold.
<s> They're all good ones.  Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.
<s> People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.
<s> I'm saying don't do it accidently.
<s> I thought it would be good to know.
<s> Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
<s> Naw, nothing.
<s> I'll show Epps.  He'll be sorry when I get this thing open.
<s> I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here.  I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing.
<s> Yeah.  So?
<s> It doesn't mean anything.
<s> Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
<s> Hell, we'll just buy our way out.
<s> Oh, no.
<s> You know what I'm doing with my half?
<s> Then lets go back while we still can.
<s> You have to go with us, Wes.
<s> You have to go with us.  You can't walk back...
<s> Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you.
<s> Anytime you want to do something about it just let--
<s> He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.
<s> He lived through that?
<s> I'm not wasting my water on him.
<s> He'd just slow us down, and drink our water.  And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.
<s> Correct.  Origin?
<s> Violation?
<s> What happened?
<s> What's the matter with you?
<s> You don't have to... I don't trust him.  You ought to file a report.
<s> Look,dirt!
<s> But it's so hopeless...you're so beautiful.
<s> But...you...
<s> AH UGH.
<s> Impossible!
<s> Why are you so concerned?
<s> It will be good for both of us. I've got it all arranged.
<s> Listen to me....You have no need to distrust me.  We're going....
<s> Look!
<s> That way.
<s> Too late....stay close.
<s> Where's LUH?
<s> Yes...
<s> We can start in the area where the robbery occurred.
<s> That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.
<s> Anything else I should know?
<s> Yep.
<s> `Til we get a better lead.
<s> I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. See, when you beat one of these things... 
<s> Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
<s> Be right back.
<s> Where you guys at?
<s> No excuses, just do it!
<s> Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. Some insured, some not. 
<s> Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.
<s> Unlikely. Probably, cash register or something.
<s> Who is he?
<s> Thank you.
<s> We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
<s> We can't take the chance. Ring down to the Bomb Squad. I want them on alert.
<s> Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-
<s> No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
<s> That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on.
<s> One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.
<s> She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
<s> She wanted to cook me breakfast.
<s> Yeah, just a nick ...
<s> Huh?
<s> I'll do it.
<s> Goddamit, Reilly--
<s> It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
<s> And diamonds in the front.
<s> Very well, Jacques.
<s> Where did you find it?
<s> erect in sweater, arms folded.
<s> I had exactly twenty thousand lire. I had just cashed a traveler's check and put it in my wallet.
<s> So I said to myself, "All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that." And then he said, "Say ah." And then I said, "Ah." And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone.
<s> Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba. 
<s> Smart. London, eh?
<s> Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
<s> I hope so, too.
<s> I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
<s> Now just a minute, Major--
<s> The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
<s> The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
<s> I'm crazy about you.  By the way, your pin.
<s> Gaston Monescu.
<s> Darling!
<s> He recognized you!
<s> <u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
<s> Oh! You didn't read it!
<s> No. What is it? Tell me.
<s> What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
<s> You're hired!
<s> How do you like my dress?
<s> Talk? About me--about us?
<s> You're conceited--
<s> <u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
<s> On the night table.
<s> What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
<s> Call the police?
<s> Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
<s> What is it, madame?
<s> Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
<s> Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
<s> I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
<s> Very well, madame. Thank you. 
<s> How much is your salary?
<s> Because I hate him--because I love you!
<s> That's right.
<s> That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.
<s> Rose Calvert.
<s> Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
<s> So do I.
<s> There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems to be quite... practical.
<s> I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.
<s> There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.  Go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back.
<s> Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing. Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come.
<s> Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!
<s> Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how it's done.
<s> Excuse me.
<s> No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
<s> I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.
<s> You're welcome. Rose.
<s> Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
<s> Yes, exactly!
<s> If only it were that simple.
<s> Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
<s> A mistake?
<s> Jack, I --
<s> You're right. Only you can do that.
<s> Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.  Hey... Monet!
<s> To the stars.
<s> Cal, you can't be serious! We're in the middle of an emergency and you --
<s> Right.
<s> I'm so cold.
<s> I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go.
<s> Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
<s> Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
<s> We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.
<s> I'm afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett.
<s> Excuse me.
<s> Charmed, I'm sure.
<s> Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
<s> That's a date. 
<s> Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming lesson I promised you?
<s> Sorry I can't return the compliment.
<s> Montana?
<s> Very much--
<s> Good-by!
<s> Brett is the name.
<s> You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
<s> Lonesome?
<s> I'll be waiting on deck.
<s> Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
<s> How're the tips?
<s> Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
<s> No, sir?
<s> Are you screwy?
<s> Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
<s> I wouldn't be surprised--
<s> Swell!
<s> Coming to the pool for a swim?
<s> Sure.
<s> That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
<s> Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.
<s> Next month is June.
<s> O.K.! Send that!
<s> Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
<s> Knots!
<s> This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
<s> That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
<s> Miss Marsh.
<s> Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
<s> News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
<s> Guess they're dull--nothing for you to reform.
<s> What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
<s> <U>He</U> does. Here's your quarter, Brett.
<s> Meaning what?
<s> So what?
<s> Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!
<s> Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
<s> You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
<s> S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
<s> What's the matter?
<s> Hey--you! Where you going?
<s> Then why did you run away?
<s> Isn't that a daisy?
<s> Gave all that up.  Going into business.
<s> Not now.  I don't have time.

<s> Just like any other hard cases. Gotta know how to handle 'em.
<s> Virgil, please.  Don't do this to me.
<s> Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.
<s> Ah, now that's the real mother- Lode in Tombstone.  Up and down Allen Street, full-blast 24 hours A day, liquor, hostesses, Gamblin', makin' money hand over Fist.  All except the Oriental.  On Account of the element.  Have a Man for breakfast in there most Days.  Regular slaughter house. High-rollers won't go near it. Too bad, nice place.
<s> - I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
<s> GET BOND OUT OF THERE.
<s> I can tell you're a man with an eye for exquisite possessions, Mr. Bond.  Darling! Come here.  I want you to meet my wife.
<s> Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
<s> Sir Elliot.
<s> I wonder if it runs in the family.
<s> Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
<s> Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
<s> - We all want what we can't have?
<s> Is that any way to say hello?
<s> Shhhhh...
<s> Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
<s> Occasionally, yes.  British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks.
<s> Hey - the world is my office.
<s> Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
<s> Interesting video tape.
<s> I didn't think so.
<s> This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.
<s> - You're not.
<s> The only mistake is that they didn't kill us in the elevator.
<s> Up.
<s> It's a lousy job, but -  The only reason I stay is for the health benefits.
<s> Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write -
<s> I see you two have met.
<s> I should have hired this man.  Get somebody up there!
<s> ...But because I am a just man, I've decided to give Mr. Hussein what he deserves.
<s> Will the cruise set it off?
<s> Junior spends time with his child.
<s> Yes.
<s> You always got something to say.
<s> I told her I would if she would give me time.
<s> I preached to Mom and Dad about it but they are stuck in their ways, it's like talking to a brick. But if there is a way...
<s> He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
<s> Do you think you won?
<s> Babe Brother.
<s> I've heard some foolish things in my life.
<s> Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.
<s> I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
<s> I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.
<s> Everything these days is made overseas.
<s> Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.
<s> It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life.
<s> She has a fish bone caught in her throat. Could all of you go in the other room? Gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil.
<s> Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
<s> Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.
<s> What's a toby?
<s> Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
<s> Don't shout!
<s> I was just trying to make conversation.
<s> You know the man next door is near death.
<s> Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
<s> Where was the last place you left him?
<s> Bye, house.
<s> Let's let Molly open one.
<s> Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
<s> Mm-hmmmmm.
<s> No, you can't.
<s> Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
<s> No!  No, that's Scud, you idiot!
<s> Go away.

<s> I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
<s> Outta my way!  Here I come, here I come --
<s> Have you been replaced?
<s> Will you quit moving around?!
<s> All right, that's enough.  Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy --
<s> Come on.  Let's get out of here.
<s> Uh-oh.
<s> Huh?
<s> She got away.
<s> Home is where the heart is.
<s> Can you move over a wee bit?
<s> In my pocket.
<s> Did you now.
<s> So did I.
<s> You're late for breakfast.
<s> It's all right, Finn.
<s> Well, I hope it stays that way.
<s> He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
<s> Well, you know, he's going to say about Madrigal... and Salazar.
<s> I want to believe you.  I really do.
<s> Arnie, thank God.
<s> Arnie, this is crazy.
<s> What is he being charged with?
<s> What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
<s> That is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us.
<s> What?
<s> I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.
<s> What do you think?
<s> How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving?  You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana.
<s> Like I give a fuck.
<s> You can't make me.
<s> Yeah.
<s> I don't know.
<s> She's your girlfriend.  Open it, talk about your kids.
<s> Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?
<s> Not Tiger Woods.
<s> I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?
<s> You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
<s> When the DEA gets into the narcotics business, then we'll stay at the Four Seasons.
<s> I don't believe you.
<s> Then I guess I'm going by myself.
<s> Not this time.
<s> We keep our mouths shut.
<s> We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
<s> If I can.
<s> It's possible.
<s> I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
<s> She snuck away.  And we haven't seen her.  She hasn't come home.
<s> We sometimes went downtown to score.
<s> I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.
<s> It's three a.m.  I'm not supposed to be here.  I snuck out --
<s> I'm off for a pish. When I come back, that money's still here, OK?
<s> You've stabbed me, man.
<s> Four kilos. That's what -- Ten years' worth? Russian sailors? Mikey Forrester? What the fuck are you on these days? You've been to jail, Spud, so what's the deal -- like it so much you want to go back again?
<s> For four fucking grand?  One palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.
<s> Diane.
<s> Eh-
<s> So why have you told me about it?
<s> What do you think -- I should be carrying a torch for you?
<s> What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
<s> Now?
<s> It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.
<s> Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --
<s> Another dab?
<s> You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him yet?
<s> Well, it's up to you.
<s> Sure, sure. I've heard it before.
<s> He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
<s> Your favourite dish.
<s> Your usual table, sir?
<s> In that case --
<s> Such as?
<s> No joy yet.
<s> Six weeks.
<s> She read it in Cosmopolitan.
<s> I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars.
<s> This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
<s> Rescued at last.
<s> Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle!
<s> Plotting our new course.
<s> Pavel.
<s> Raise shields.
<s> Understood. Kirk out.
<s> The power was within you.
<s> Perhaps I have a way to bring one here.
<s> I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
<s> Aye, Captain  How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job...
<s> Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
<s> Why didn't you beep my communicator?
<s> Put it on the screen.
<s> Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
<s> I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.
<s> Are we leaving, Captain?
<s> I cannot be certain.
<s> Why?
<s> Captain, what have I done -
<s> No, no, no, Captain. You do not understand. Sybok also in a son of Sarek.
<s> The only problem is, it's up there. We're down here.
<s> The emergency channel, open.
<s> I believe we are witnessing my birth.
<s> But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
<s> Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.
<s> 
<s> Oh, I cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
<s> Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.
<s> No. I will not.
<s> I hide no pain.
<s> I don't understand..  Reveal yourself to me!
<s> Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
<s> Okay, okay...
<s> Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers will start thinking, and people will stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some data through. See you tomorrow.
<s> oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
<s> No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
<s> If you think -
<s> When you've been in the system as long as I have, you hear many promises... many reassurances...many brave plans...
<s> They may be... de-rezzed... on the carrier ... hurry...
<s> Wrote the...?
<s> Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
<s> All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake, at least.
<s> Elementary physics... a beam of energy can always be diverted... ooh, my head  Are we there yet, Mommy?
<s> Probably.
<s> Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
<s> We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
<s> We have to.
<s> Okay.  Let's step up the surveillance on her.  Put on two more guys.
<s> It's Talkradio.  You're on the air.
<s> Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.
<s> Nope.  The art buys are in a separate ledger.
<s> It can't be.  Not Helen.
<s> Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.
<s> What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
<s> You didn't have sexual relations with him?
<s> Yes sir.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> Very good.  It's sixth century B.C.  Do you like the period?
<s> I agree.
<s> Is that why you got into this business?
<s> And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.
<s> Yeah.  You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount...
<s> I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
<s> What did you need?
<s> Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
<s> Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
<s> I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order.
<s> Dance?
<s> Those idiots.
<s> No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.
<s> Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions.  See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for.  Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.
<s> I'm married!
<s> Nope.
<s> And here we are.
<s> Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?
<s> Where are you from.
<s> I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
<s> That's a "Rookies" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "The Black Hole"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.
<s> Five.
<s> Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> I don't believe so.
<s> I just gotta get somethin'.
<s> No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
<s> You don't know him -
<s> What?
<s> How come?
<s> You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch.
<s> It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. "Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think?
<s> In fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D, toss me that shotgun.
<s> With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?
<s> He don't got no right to live.
<s> I'm her husband.
<s> No thanks.
<s> I certainly hope so.
<s> Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So, you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?
<s> Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -
<s> Elliot.
<s> Elliot Blitzer.
<s> The zoo.  What are you waiting for?
<s> Let me handle this.
<s> I know that Richard. I don't think I'll need it. But something this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a gun and not to have it.
<s> Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
<s> He trusts you?
<s> Riddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what the fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort it, he can play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's best friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. I'm not puttin' him down. Hey, let him run wild. Have a ball, it's his money. But, don't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some guts.
<s> Mr. Donowitz?  I told you, through Dick.  He's in my acting class.  About a year.  Yeah, he's good.  They grew up together.  Sure thing.
<s> I can see what you mean.
<s> The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot.
<s> Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is "Doctor Zhivago". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine.
<s> Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
<s> Anything stronger?  Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
<s> You're always making jokes. That's what you do, isn't it? Make jokes. Making jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it? But if you make a joke about this -  - I'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head!
<s> Step inside.
<s> Absolutely.
<s> Okee-dokee. It's like this, Krinkle; a patrol car stops this dork for speeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke. So they bring his ass in and me an' Nicholson go to work on him.
<s> You're no longer an extra -
<s> How the fuck could he know?
<s> How's he supposed to see the wire?
<s> Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.
<s> Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy - I would never eat any pussy - but, if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.
<s> - Because it's good!
<s> No way, JosÈ.
<s> No.
<s> Do you know a Clarence Worley?
<s> Uh, what?
<s> You're still a little... disoriented.
<s> What are you going to do with us?
<s> Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.  This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall?
<s> This is April, right?
<s> Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's not the right number yet.  That's the problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them?
<s> It's the next step.  I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone.  Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?
<s> You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.
<s> "If something really happens"...like what, James?
<s> And I was in it?  What did I do?
<s> When I was a kid I identified with that kid, down there alone in that pipe...a hundred feet down -- doesn't know if they're going to save him.
<s> Nevermind.  It's not real -- it's a hoax.  A prank.  He's hiding in a barn. Hey, turn left here.  Left!
<s> ...I had a dream about...something like that.
<s> Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
<s> In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't.  If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police.
<s> Airports all look the same.  Maybe it's...  James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.
<s> What's that mean?
<s> And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"
<s> I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
<s> She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
<s> You really want to know?
<s> He's been tested for drugs?
<s> You want to go in?  Examine him?
<s> I'm sorry, I didn't--
<s> Same back at you.
<s> You want to make a kiddies bet?
<s> That's my morning's pay.
<s> It is not.
<s> You Harlin?
<s> Yep.
<s> Look, pal, I've got places to be. Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
<s> I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
<s> What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
<s> There you go, sweet talking me again.
<s> What's it to you?
<s> Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
<s> Yes.  Yes it is.
<s> I . . .
<s> He killed him, Sheriff!  I couldn't stop him!  He made me come with him. He told me if I said a word he would kill me too.
<s> Who the hell is this!?
<s> Wrong number.
<s> I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
<s> Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
<s> The wind isn't blowing.
<s> Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
<s> I just drove in this morning.
<s> Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
<s> All over.  Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.
<s> If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
<s> I pack up and go somewhere else.
<s> Did you like it; me watching you?
<s> Nothing like a little liveliness.
<s> Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
<s> Yeah, I guess you're right.
<s> I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Grace, I can't.  I can't even get out of here myself.  I need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic.
<s> You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
<s> It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
<s> What about us?
<s> I thought you couldn't leave.  I thought you couldn't get your car.
<s> You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?
<s> You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
<s> But you said we could be together.
<s> Grace!
<s> I'll get it.
<s> Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.
<s> I'm her husband.
<s> A lot that means.
<s> Is this what it's all about?  You sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you?  Forget it.  You want to take my head off, Mister, I won't even try to stop you.  I deserve it for being an idiot.  But if you're not, I think I'll be on my way.
<s> Accident.
<s> Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
<s> I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.
<s> Like you don't know.
<s> How do you put a price on murder?
<s> I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
<s> Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?
<s> There's another reason?  It better be good.
<s> Christ, Jake, please--
<s> You're not talking sense.
<s> It's not me you have to worry about. It's her.  She wants you dead, Jake. She wants you dead and she wants your money.
<s> You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
<s> I wasn't sneaking around with your girl.  Would you please tell him?
<s> Give it to me!
<s> You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it.  I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
<s> No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
<s> Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.
<s> What happened?
<s> No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
<s> Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
<s> Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
<s> Sure you do.  Everybody in town knows about the money Jake kept hid in the house.  It's a wonder the Mrs. here just now got round to killing him.  Not for lack of trying.
<s> Senor, you need a doctor.
<s> Yeah, sure.  You got change?
<s> He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
<s> ...And everything is nothing too.
<s> Who's cursed?
<s> You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to you.
<s> You know I won't be seeing you.
<s> That's a solid name.
<s> Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
<s> Would I what?
<s> How do you know if you've never tried?
<s> I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.
<s> It's the truth, Jake.
<s> That country shit all sounds the same to me.
<s> No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?
<s> Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
<s> How much!?
<s> I don't have a goddamn credit card.
<s> Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key.
<s> No.
<s> Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
<s> Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
<s> You should be more careful.
<s> No trouble at all, really.
<s> Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
<s> All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
<s> If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
<s> I pack up and go somewhere else.
<s> Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
<s> Try me.
<s> Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.
<s> If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
<s> I don't think we have anything to talk about.
<s> I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.  The only reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it.  It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here.  But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
<s> After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
<s> It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is!
<s> But I thought --
<s> He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...
<s> Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
<s> You think now that Jake's dead, there's all that money there and I don't need you anymore, and I might just sneak up behind you sometime and...pop!
<s> You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
<s> Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here.
<s> How much?
<s> Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
<s> Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
<s> Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
<s> Oh.
<s> Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?
<s> Yes.
<s> Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
<s> That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
<s> My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.
<s> Yes.
<s> Rust?
<s> My turn.  When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?
<s> Seventy-five percent.
<s> You assumed wrong.
<s> Technically no. I gambled that you would attend the church service. I just waited for you.
<s> Is there a problem?
<s> But not a knife?
<s> Have you ever tried to develop it?
<s> It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.
<s> No. And I have been sick. I spent a week in a hospital when I was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning. Two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool. They were dunking me. I swallowed water. They didn't know it and they almost killed me.  Heroes don't get killed like that. Normal people do.
<s> We are.
<s> Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
<s> What things?
<s> I'll help you.
<s> Know what?
<s> Is that right?
<s> This kid is six foot two, two hundred and forty pounds. He runs the fifty in under six seconds. He's going to be a God.
<s> Fine.
<s> No.
<s> I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition.
<s> Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
<s> I fined 'em instead.
<s> On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.
<s> Thank God.
<s> Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
<s> Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
<s> Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
<s> Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.
<s> You ain't dead.
<s> Porch. I'm puttin' a porch on her so's I can puff my pipe of an evening an' drink my coffee an' watch the sun set.
<s> What's your name?
<s> Well, Mister Beauchamp... from what I read of this here book, I'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher.
<s> Duck, I says.  "You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran," said the duck. "You must apologize." But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns." 
<s> N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
<s> On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
<s> What business?
<s> He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
<s> He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better get him.
<s> You missed him? You didn't...?
<s> Maybe, maybe not. Got him in the gut, I think.
<s> Yeah.
<s> First one what?
<s> H-hell yeah. I killed the hell out of him... three shots... he was takin' a sh-sh-shit an'... an'...
<s> Well, I gu-guess they had it... comin'.
<s> Well, you don't wanna trust me too much. We'll take Ned his share together so you don't figure I run off with it.
<s> Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
<s> You sure you ain't armed?
<s> A writer? What do you write... letters an' such?
<s> Yeah.
<s> Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
<s> Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
<s> We'll come across him tomorra, I guess.
<s> I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
<s> Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.
<s> What?
<s> Who said that?
<s> Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more.
<s> Nothin's bent.
<s> Plenty of times.
<s> Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
<s> Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
<s> All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks.
<s> Maybe.
<s> Just like that?
<s> He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
<s> No good. He needs guarantees. He says... his life is in danger... He has seen the Devil... looked him in the eye.
<s> He says he knows his face. He sees it when he closes his eyes.
<s> + The nose is sharper. Smaller too.                          +  &lt;&lt;And what about the hair? You said something earlier about it.&gt;&gt;
<s> He says the hair is longer and lighter.
<s> I'm having a stroke.
<s> Just forget about it.
<s> Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
<s> Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me a little more, that's what. No matter how well you cover my tracks now, they'll find out who I am.
<s> Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
<s> This whole thing was a shakedown.
<s> You are a criminal.
<s> Can we stealth these guys?
<s> McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job - Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff.
<s> Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
<s> Russian, I think. I don't know.
<s> What time is it?
<s> We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
<s> I've got a ton of work and no good people.
<s> Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
<s> Who is he?
<s> The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.
<s> Which is shit.
<s> Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
<s> Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -
<s> Convince me. Tell me every last detail. 52    SCENE DELETED                                                              52 53    INT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                                  53                         + Kovash's room is now filled with people. Jack Baer stands next to DANIEL METZHEISER, a balding man in his forties. Next to him is Doctor Plumber. Across from her is Ridgly Waiters.
<s> Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.
<s> If there is a Keyser Soze he'll be looking for you.
<s> Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
<s> Why didn't you say anything?
<s> Then why didn't you help him?
<s> But Keaton...
<s> I said I never heard of him.
<s> He wanted me to live.
<s> You think he's..?
<s> Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan. You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11 keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And if they kill me, it's
<s> Abrams...
<s> She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
<s> As far as we know, nothing.
<s> Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
<s> This is a nuisance suit.  He's looking for small change.  He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
<s> Mickey told me to come back to work.
<s> ...We did everything we could...
<s> Nothing further, your Honor.
<s> You may step down.
<s> I...
<s> You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
<s> I completely understand ...
<s> It's completely done on a contingency basis.  That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third ...that is, of course, the usual arrangement ...
<s> What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
<s> ...I made a reservation at...
<s> ...What difference would...
<s> No.  No thank you, Doctor.  You go home.
<s> Her doctors killed her.
<s> Her doctors murdered her.  They gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.    Her doctors murdered her.
<s> ... that's perfectly all right.
<s> No.
<s> Nothing happened.
<s> I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
<s> I'm sure you would.
<s> Overruled...
<s> Missus...
<s> Laura.
<s> And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
<s> Who told you that?
<s> Is there going to be a later...?
<s> No.
<s> Dr. Gruber's not in.
<s> I'm going to help her.
<s> What?
<s> You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
<s> So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
<s> The Doctors.
<s> ...you need some old forms that she had...somebody's dying...
<s> We got to talk.
<s> It's locked.
<s> ... You saw her?
<s> ... But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson ... and they called him  up and said to come out. He's a good man.  He's only trying to do what's right.
<s> I'm going to see you get that chance.
<s> In New York?
<s> You live in the neighborhood?
<s> How old is he?
<s> Mrs...
<s> Yes.
<s> Yes.
<s> As I've said we had some more...
<s> Ah? That complicates the problem.
<s> No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town.
<s> Well?
<s> And when she goes to those places...
<s> What for? Who are you?
<s> Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
<s> Do you live here in the hotel?
<s> Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
<s> You're not far wrong.
<s> You won't have to.
<s> But you haven't lived here long.
<s> I want to know who you are.
<s> I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
<s> I'll take care of you.
<s> I just want to see you as much as I can!
<s> But Scottie, you don't have to!
<s> No, it's not right.
<s> Judy --
<s> We'll take it! Will it fit?
<s> You can.
<s> Ah, no!
<s> It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.
<s> Too late. I've got my face on.
<s> How does it work?
<s> I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
<s> But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
<s> Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!!
<s> Some money.
<s> No...
<s> This afternoon.
<s> Before?  Where?  Where had you been?
<s> I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
<s> Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.
<s> Wander about.
<s> Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
<s> You've nothing to apologize for.
<s> No! No, thank you!
<s> Well... anywhere in particular?
<s> Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.
<s> Long ago...
<s> A grave...
<s> No.
<s> And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
<s> Only this far.
<s> But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
<s> To the church, I must go there.
<s> Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
<s> What's tomorrow?
<s> Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.
<s> That's following a train of thought.
<s> He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
<s> Sorry, old man. Work.
<s> What.
<s> Who's the guy, who's the wife?
<s> Where?
<s> All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
<s> Wandering.
<s> Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
<s> By whom?
<s> Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this...  ...and the skirt out. 
<s> What did you say?
<s> Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
<s> Boyd brought up divorce statistics.
<s> I don't have to...
<s> You don't know what you're doing.
<s> You're a lying deviant. What did you do?!
<s> We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
<s> Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.
<s> It's a marble floor, we can clean it up.
<s> No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
<s> I can't do this.
<s> They're on me. They're smoking me out!
<s> Adam! Calm down.
<s> Later.
<s> Well, oh...
<s> You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
<s> I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
<s> Give me two more.
<s> No.
<s> Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens?  They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal...  Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose...
<s> I'm calling the police.
<s> I'm talking about prayer.
<s> It's my fucking opinion.
<s> And what happens when you can't?
<s> They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
<s> The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.
<s> What? What's your point?
<s> Not really, no.
<s> You will not screw this up.
<s> He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out.
<s> Why what?
<s> He's a moron.
<s> I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
<s> Who else?
<s> I've known him since Cub Scouts.
<s> I'm not. What's the problem?
<s> So what do we do?
<s> I'm mad at you.
<s> Hey. It's me.
<s> Like how?
<s> Yeah, Dad. It's great.
<s> About what?
<s> I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
<s> Buzzing?
<s> A move?
<s> I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn."
<s> I kind of like "till death do us part." I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think?
<s> Okay great. What will that be?
<s> What song?
<s> Let me go, Don Amalio, I'll tear her apart.
<s> To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
<s> You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
<s> And this innocent child.
<s> Don't go!
<s> You must listen to me before you go.
<s> She won't even know.
<s> I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ...
<s> Nothing.
<s> I think I'd better go tomorrow.
<s> That's life. Some people are brought together, others are separated. What can we do, if that's the way it happens?
<s> There's plenty of money in this house. Piles of it.
<s> That will teach you not to bother me any more, you son of a bitch.
<s> Why did he kill himself?
<s> That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
<s> Leave him alone.
<s> I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
<s> Are you sure it isn't contagious?
<s> Right, I won't say that, but I still think they're no use.
<s> Stop this!
<s> Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
<s> Don Jaime loved to watch me skip.
<s> This louse is looking for trouble.
<s> In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
<s> He has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so little to you, Viridiana?
<s> Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
<s> But only you will know he's not human.
<s> He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
<s> Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
<s> I'm getting by.
<s> You son—of—a—bitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?
<s> Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
<s> We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary re—assignment.
<s> The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.
<s> You're the highest law enforcement official in the country. Use the fucking army if you need to.
<s> The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
<s> Do I get to see it or not?
<s> It feels so.. .real.
<s> How do you kill it?
<s> Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
<s> All my work is my finest.
<s> Fine. Never felt better in my life.  See, I'm a good liar.
<s> He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.
<s> Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
<s> Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
<s> Nothing.
<s> This isn't a game, Parker!
<s> If you're gonna do it, better do it now.
<s> Part of him is.
<s> A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.
<s> Lindenmeyer?
<s> Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
<s> You are going after Mayor Bennett.
<s> As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
<s> Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.

<s> All I need is the one day.
<s> Yes -- It will... Now:  why is the President in China?
<s> We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.
<s> Who's gonna tell'em.
<s> The Hostages...?

Well, to the Family of William A. Schumann, to the Men and Women of Unit 303, to my fellow citizens <u>I</u> say "courage."  I have informed the Albanian government, and I inform <u>you</u>, that we will not rest until the safe return of Sergeant Schwn&nn.  I'm told his unit mates gave him the nickname, "Old Shoe."

<s> Better.
<s> Come on, you fucking sissy, you think this is tough? Try show-business.  1970-1990, n'ybody I worked with, y'could of bottled their piss n'sold it in the <u>ghettos</u>...  Come on, Pal...
<s> How 'bout a Cold Drink...?
<s> Oh really.
<s> Sounds like a french word, what is it?
<s> Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?
<s> ...light snack, but good, thanks pal, you're sharking your way up...
<s> ...gotta read my reports.
<s> It's called pasta now Dad, spaghetti's out of date.
<s> D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was when the options he bought took a bath. He reneged on me.
<s> 50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes...
<s> Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise.
<s> Not in here Dad... please. Later.
<s> ... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner?
<s> Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday.
<s> That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim.
<s> Your men! All my life "your men" have been able to count on you? Why is it that you've never been there for me?
<s> You speak for me, son.
<s> Stay here, I'll see what I can do.
<s> Yes! Read the Constitution, it's all in there. And remember--you don't know anything, nothing.
<s> Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while.  Work up an appetite.
<s> Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.
<s> Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
<s> There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
<s> No sir, that would've been illegal...
<s> ...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.
<s> Stick around... Larry, one of my "gang" -- Bud Fox.
<s> Yeah aren't you forgetting something Gordon: rule one, capital reserves. This company has $75 million cash in an overfunded pension. That buys us a lot of credibility...  ...and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker...
<s> Break it.
<s> The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
<s> You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?
<s> ...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it. 
<s> I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio.
<s> Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much.
<s> At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger.
<s> Any better and I'd be guilty.
<s> Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it.
<s> Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
<s> ...just kickin' ass and taking names, Mr. Mannheim.
<s> ...that "scum" built this company up from one plane in thirty years, they made something out of nothing, and if that's a scum I'll take one over a rat any day...
<s> Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
<s> Yeah, yeah, OK
<s> Hi
<s> It's all rather morbid though isn't it?
<s> Are you sure you wouldn't like a closer look?
<s> Jenkins!
<s> What?  Tony and China, together?
<s> I'm not kidding.  I want to get out of here - now, ok.
<s> Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.
<s> So Mark, what's so urgent?
<s> Well divide 18 into three
<s> But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
<s> You guys are being real assholes
<s> It's only two hours away.
<s> I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
<s> So much.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Fine.
<s> Try to communicate with her somehow.
<s> Can't hurt.  And I think it's important you find out what she wants.
<s> What do you think?  Guess.
<s> I know how hard it can be sometimes.
<s> Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year.
<s> Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
<s> I have to go.
<s> Is everything alright?
<s> That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
<s> This fence...it's so...
<s> You know where she is?
<s> She never mentioned her father.
<s> You must have been very proud.
<s> Biology.  She wanted to be a doctor.
<s> She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
<s> I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?
<s> Shhh.
<s> Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
<s> No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
<s> We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
<s> Did he say that?
<s> Not the focus.
<s> Tomorrow.
<s> Unless you need me to come home...
<s> You are so brilliant.
<s> You're kidding.
<s> Well, that's nice.
<s> What?  No.  No.
<s> Dinner.  With Stan and his new girl.
<s> What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
<s> Well, that's a relief.
<s> What can it hurt to talk to someone?
<s> No!  And I don't need a psychiatrist!
<s> Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
<s> You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
<s> I will NOT.
<s> Yep.
<s> But I don't remember.
<s> It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
<s> STOP IT!
<s> Who?
<s> Oh God...
<s> She can't be here without me.
<s> :Well, they are.
<s> :Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved. No, they don't think that way.
<s> I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health.  I'm the doctor.
<s> But why would they do that...?
<s> In certain cases, hell is the operative word.
<s> I under5tand.  All the same
<s> It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -
<s> Better than most, I suppose.
<s> Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!
<s> FAST.
<s> It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
<s> I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...
<s> You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?!
<s> I don't know what you are!!!
<s> 'Kill you...?'  You are my mother.  Do you think I would hurt you...?
<s> Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
<s> You knelt there, helpless-  You couldn't save him.   There was so such anger in you-.   Death infuriates you...
<s> And whose houses do you design...?
<s> Mm-hmm.     Scared-  I feel a little like the moth and the flame.
<s> Captain's orders.
<s> I know.  It's not possible --- but I know.
<s> Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...?  God, Michael --- what am I...?
<s> He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!
<s> But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?
<s> Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
<s> Hello..
<s> I don't think of us that way - ever.
<s> Did you see the old man on the ---
<s> - we made a fire.
<s> Where are you gitting these...?  Aaron --- if it's a boy.
<s> Hi.    You - you wanna get some breakfast...?  Maybe see a movie...?
<s> That's a wasp.  Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored-  so - where is she...?
<s> You know that circulation is down for three months in a row.
<s> I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.
<s> No - I've been abroad for a long time...
<s> Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
<s> Sure...
<s> Yes, two please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, it's just that I really loved your book
<s> I think I will pass...
<s> No she didn't...
<s> Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
<s> Wonderful - like a great release - He was a malignant cancer and I had to remove him - the world is better without him
<s> STEPHANIE?
<s> It was wrong - all my life I have been cheated - cheated of anything good - I shouldn't have been born - I was a mistake - my natural mother was a whore - that makes me...
<s> Why whats wrong with the sugar -
<s> Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
<s> It's what you would do to me
<s> I had an accident - I fell down stairs...
<s> Yes, sorry - He's here to make sure that you are alright
<s> Astronomical.
<s> Well, Dad said...
<s> Maybe he got promoted.
<s> Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
<s> This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
<s> Not ever. Never.
<s> I better go, Dad.
<s> You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
<s> Jealousy is so unattractive.
<s> From your lips, to God's ears.
<s> SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.
<s> Then you better get in the water, before you get burned.
<s> We own a small family grocery store.
<s> Yeah.
<s> Consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives.
<s> I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
<s> Of course we were.
<s> Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. Next month we'll be back to normal.
<s> I understand.
<s> What about the future? You planning to rock the boat at all? Stir things up in "Heaven?"
<s> I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
<s> Most places are, Jimmy.
<s> I didn't forget.
<s> I'm trying to help.
<s> You've got enough people kissing your ass.
<s> Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in.
<s> He phoned it in.
<s> I doubt it.
<s> Your dad taught you everything.
<s> Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
<s> I know.
<s> I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
<s> Not a chance.
<s> You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
<s> I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board.
<s> Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
<s> Only the best for my mother.
<s> I'll make you very proud.
<s> Oh. Goodness.
<s> Forget the store. Think big.
<s> Don't say "shit," honey. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
<s> I guess you won't be wanting that Rolex I sent you, then?
<s> Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
<s> Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
<s> Yeah.  Everything's cool.
<s> Really? You'd do that for me?
<s> My parents always say hard work builds character.
<s> You think we should be more open minded?
<s> I'm Ted Nelson. I guess you already know that part.  For two years I've been the editor of the high school paper in Xenia, Ohio. I've won some awards, made a difference. I've always had journalism in my soul. Now I know why.
<s> I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
<s> It's about your parents.
<s> The teeth doin' any talkin'?
<s> What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
<s> Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
<s> Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
<s> He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
<s> Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
<s> There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house.  There's phones there.  I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found.  I don't know... Maybe I should have called.  But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself.  I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office.
<s> She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
<s> I net a guy in a bar.
<s> I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened.  I did that once.  I don't want to do it again.
<s> You have someplace to be?
<s> Ray, you heard him...
<s> He dropped Jimmy off first?
<s> So you were alone.
<s> What was that?
<s> You didn't cuff her?
<s> Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass.
<s> Yeah... okay... he did
<s> Okay!  He did.  He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  Now, can I go home?
<s> I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
<s> No!
<s> Hey, you're working for it.  Least you're supposed to be.
<s> What?
<s> No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
<s> Yeah, but...
<s> Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
<s> Curiosity, I guess.
<s> Whichever one I want.
<s> I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
<s> Where, the mall?
<s> No I didn't.  Check out the Jeep.  It's nice and dirty for you.  But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving.
<s> Okay.  I love you too.
<s> Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
<s> You can't...
<s> You got something against cigarettes?
<s> About what?
<s> I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now...
<s> The bitch shot me, is what happened.
<s> Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
<s> So maybe I'm a one-woman man.
<s> Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
<s> Put them all together and what do we have?
<s> All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
<s> I'll work on it.
<s> Prepare what?
<s> I'm going to hit you.
<s> At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
<s> "Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
<s> Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
<s> I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
<s> My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case.  I spent three years on the stage, you know.  Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear.
<s> Not likely.  There must be tracks of twenty different wagons.  Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...
<s> Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
<s> He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
<s> What is this?  A whole new train?
<s> Yes, me!
<s> I get that feeling.  You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
<s> Really?
<s> Well, I owe you one, don't I?
<s> I suppose so.  But life can be hard for a man, too.
<s> Fine, I'll stop.
<s> This is Colonel Richards.
<s> On my way to Denver...
<s> Dr. Loveless?
<s> "Emperor Miguelito...?"
<s> Who was this partner of his?
<s> You're not going to use it, are you?
<s> Right.
<s> No.  I mean yes.
<s> My step-father's going to tear you apart.
<s> Say what?
<s> Good.  How long will it take?
<s> You hear trouble.
<s> These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
<s> Elora Danan!
<s> My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help.
<s> What are you gonna become, Raziel? Queen of the rodents?
<s> I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
<s> I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
<s> Me!
<s> We need blood.  To nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy.
<s> No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
<s> No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!
<s> Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
<s> I can't see anything--she's too bright!
<s> The sorceress.
<s> Queen Bavmorda transformed her.
<s> It's been a while.
<s> Okay, Mr. Book.
<s> Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!
<s> Yeah.
<s> The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
<s> A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.
<s> Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.
<s> Something wrong with buttons?
<s> Not long... A few days.
<s> Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
<s> That's your way, not mine.
<s> At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
<s> We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
<s> Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter.
<s> No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
<s> Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?
<s> Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
<s> If she...
<s> Is morally, ethic'ly
<s> Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
<s> Goodbye, folks!
<s> Hickory!
<s> Are you all right, Dorothy?
<s> Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
<s> Catch him, you fool!
<s> That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
<s> No, I'm afraid I didn't.
<s> Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
<s> Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying.
<s> Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
<s> Stop her!
<s> ...Oh, did that hurt?
<s> Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
<s> No, but you tried to.
<s> Oh.
<s> The nerve.
<s> Look!  He's rusted again.  Oh, give me the oil can -- quick!  Oh-oh, quick!
<s> In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King!  If....
<s> Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
<s> But why?  Why?
<s> Oh, come on.
<s> Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.
<s> What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
<s> They would?
<s> Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.
<s> Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
<s> Who at?
<s> What's the matter?
<s> Oh - I was only trying to help. Ohhh!
<s> She - she can have my Witch Remover.
<s> Hold still - hold still --
<s> Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
<s> Don't push!
<s> Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
<s> B-B-B-B-B-But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it!
<s> Hurry -- hurry --
<s> It's a whozis?
<s> Oh --
<s> Here’s your imposter. He’s paid off the men on the plane outside.  They’re not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, they’re flying it wherever he tells them.
<s> Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  He’s not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub’s reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
<s> Like riding a bike.
<s> Quite the opposite, in fact.
<s> Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
<s> It’s I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.
<s> Yes.
<s> It’s not the pin your father wore. It’s an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
<s> I know.
<s> I used my body on the guards.  It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance.  I’ve never told anyone that.
<s> I think you do.
<s> Have some of the rat’s nest caviar.  From my own fishery.  They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House.
<s> She’s no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
<s> Where?
<s> To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
<s> How would you know?
<s> And expensive.  Cost three million plus.
<s> Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
<s> God isn't there to do it.
<s> We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
<s> Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
<s> That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
<s> I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
<s> I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
<s> You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
<s> What is it?  How does it work?
<s> Adrian -- you've lost it.
<s> Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
<s> Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.
<s> Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
<s> Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
<s> Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
<s> Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.
<s> Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
<s> Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . 
<s> Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
<s> Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
<s> -- What?
<s> Then why don't you ask him?!?
<s> What does this mean?  What does it --
<s> Maybe I'll do that.
<s> Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
<s> Ever see one of these before?
<s> What is that ungodly smell?
<s> Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
<s> Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
<s> Is that a fact?
<s> There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
<s> Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?
<s> You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
<s> Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.
<s> Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
<s> You're a jerk-off, you know that?
<s> I think we should send him whatever he wants.
<s> You wanna check it out? Come here.
<s> "Anarchy" 99"?
<s> Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
<s> Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type.
<s> Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.
<s> The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
<s> I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
<s> Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
<s> What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
<s> What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
<s> A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
<s> If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
<s> Let me.
<s> That's would be me.
<s> Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
<s> Alright, so I'll get more.
<s> Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.
<s> Been to any good diners lately?
<s> He's a pretty good actor, though.
<s> This pizda? Never seen him before.
<s> Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
<s> Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
<s> How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
<s> Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
<s> Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
<s> The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind.  It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.
<s> ... until he found tungsten.
<s> Beast.
<s> Sure you are, sport.
<s> I've seen a lot of rings.
<s> Control, Senator...  we teach them control.
<s> I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet.  Perhaps even your children, Senator.
<s> I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
<s> We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago.
<s> They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
<s> Enough for a test.
<s> ALIVE.
<s> The way what is going to be?
<s> Yes, my dear, he is.
<s> Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
<s> I did, sir.
<s> Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
<s> I...
<s> Darling!
<s> Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
<s> Darling, you mustn't worry so.
<s> Yes, but... I thought, perhaps tonight, under the circumstances, I might... stay here with you.
<s> May I have it, please?
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
<s> Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
<s> Hearts and kidneys are Tinker Toys! I'm talking about the Central Nervous System.
<s> But your grandfather's work, sir...
<s> I wonder what's got into them?
<s> Don't fall for that one.
<s> I'm not trying to be funny.
<s> ... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
<s> What did you find out?
<s> That sound good, boss.
<s> It's alive!
<s> MMmmm!  MMmmm!
<s> Don't you think I know that?  But what are you judging by?  Bucharest??? This was always a hick town.  They can't get a 'Bus and Truck' company to come in here.  Are you going to let these idiots get the best of you? ...Or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together?
<s> It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?
<s> That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
<s> Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
<s> And look at this, Doctor!
<s> Yes!
<s> Raise the platform, hurry!
<s> This is not the finals -- just sing!
<s> Stop -- singing!!!
<s> I see what you mean.
<s> It wouldn't be fair to her.
<s> Eleven o'clock, My LorJ 42
<s> I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Yes.
<s> Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
<s> Right.  Bombardier, to me please.
<s> I think Chelmsford wants a good man on the border Why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady Commander in reserve.
<s> And I assure you, you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen?
