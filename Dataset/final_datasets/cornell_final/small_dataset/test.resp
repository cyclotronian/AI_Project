<s> Can you at least start wearing a bra?
<s> So did you
<s> Don't make me do it, man
<s> Passion is something one cannot control!
<s> What about Oleg?
<s> I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
<s> Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
<s> I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
<s> I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
<s> Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
<s> That's the way I see it, too.
<s> You gotta push the little yellow button...
<s> I told you I can't, not yet.
<s> I want to go home.
<s> Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
<s> You make me sick. I can't believe you've sunk so low.
<s> Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
<s> You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
<s> I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
<s> Negative.
<s> That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
<s> Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
<s> Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
<s> Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
<s> I don't know. He has pains.
<s> Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
<s> I thought you were asleep.
<s> It's okay. I want to talk to you.
<s> Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
<s> You could have told them!
<s> She's a jerk.
<s> I assume full responsibility.
<s> I heard that.
<s> Yeah.
<s> What is it?
<s> I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.
<s> So who was he with?
<s> Low enough to relay internet traffic.
<s> Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!
<s> You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
<s> Very good, Steed ...
<s> Because I love her. What can I tell you?
<s> I don't know.
<s> He's out.
<s> "Don?"
<s> DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
<s> You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
<s> Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
<s> Good night, my little darling.
<s> He's lying.
<s> They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
<s> Do what?
<s> No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
<s> Hardy, for Chrissakes --
<s> Yes.
<s> Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
<s> No, ma'am.
<s> She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
<s> What's on your mind?
<s> His company made us.
<s> Nope.
<s> Ugh.
<s> You reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, Leon.
<s> Really?
<s> Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
<s> Of course.
<s> I'll be all right.
<s> Mutants?!
<s> No, please. I won't.
<s> Here's to Ben.
<s> I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.
<s> Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?
<s> Shhh. I'll tell you.
<s> We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
<s> I'll see you there.
<s> I warned you, Dignan.
<s> So let the council swear publicly.
<s> It matters not, he is thy king!
<s> Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
<s> Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
<s> Take it.
<s> This is my home.  I'm part of the wallpaper.
<s> You sure we're clear?
<s> I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
<s> You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
<s> It's not that.
<s> I was at Beadles.
<s> Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
<s> Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a minute.
<s> You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...
<s> Mommy, I'm scared.
<s> We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
<s> It's okay.
<s> I don't care. I wanna hear more.
<s> Until it withers away.
<s> Because you tell Mom everything.
<s> Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
<s> I got a hairdo.
<s> I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think?
<s> The Age of Ragnarok ends...
<s> Why?
<s> I'm not nuts.
<s> I want to have a baby.
<s> Guess what I'm wearing.
<s> I have a family, Mary.
<s> Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
<s> He's crashing...
<s> With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
<s> Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
<s> The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude.
<s> OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk. 
<s> Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
<s> I don't know what you're talking about!
<s> Gonna stay for a couple?
<s> Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
<s> What?
<s> Gimme the keys.
<s> Real McCoy.
<s> How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.
<s> Blank faces here, O'Neil.
<s> What?
<s> Well, I think you're cute.
<s> That's right.
<s> Delighted, sir.
<s> Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
<s> I can't do it.
<s> I believe it.
<s> That's right. Three percent.
<s> So what did happen?
<s> I really didn't get a good look at her.
<s> It's just that, well, you know, Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I don't want to give her the wrong idea... you know...
<s> I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
<s> FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
<s> How is he these days?
<s> Let him trust Quintus.
<s> You do?
<s> Hello -- who is this?
<s> We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
<s> Is it?
<s> Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
<s> Yes -- oh!
<s> I don't want them now.
<s> No, doctor.
<s> Here, hold up!
<s> I like you, too.
<s> I'll get you a check.
<s> All? It ain't bad.
<s> I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is.
<s> But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
<s> Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
<s> There it is.  Give it to me.
<s> Load it for her.
<s> He's dead, you know.
<s> Jesus.
<s> Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
<s> Goodbye.
<s> Tijuana.
<s> I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
<s> Like what?
<s> Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
<s> Professor, that girl you were talking about --
<s> You can keep them.
<s> What the fuck is that?
<s> Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
<s> It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
<s> I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  It's just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?
<s> But I did live.
<s> The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
<s> His only kid.
<s> Just your pappy scared some.
<s> And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
<s> They've got the real thing outside.
<s> And absent bridegrooms!
<s> Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.
<s> Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
<s> Aw, shit...  I gotta pee anyway.
<s> Sorry.
<s> Thought you only drank milk.
<s> Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
<s> Stay alive.
<s> Do we have to?
<s> All right.  I'll be right back.
<s> That signal. It's a countdown.
<s> Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
<s> I usually don't.
<s> Don't call me that, please.
<s> Yes, I understand.
<s> Holy cow -- India? How do you know we're in --
<s> Disinterest?
<s> They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
<s> Well, what do you really think, though?
<s> I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --
<s> Marylin?
<s> Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.
<s> Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
<s> Can I see your I.D.?
<s> It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
<s> So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
<s> You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.
<s> Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
<s> I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?
<s> Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
<s> Are you serious?
<s> Then what are you doing here?
<s> You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
<s> I don't know!
<s> Where is he?
<s> No, you're dead! You're all dead!
<s> Negative.
<s> No...  You think we can get back with those?
<s> Let it go, don't waste your time.
<s> Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.
<s> It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.
<s> Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
<s> I think you're like the best girl I've ever kissed.
<s> But I only had sex with Telly.
<s> I know.
<s> You are!  I don't like you.
<s> No.
<s> I killed him... and cut him and ate all of him... I left nothing for you!
<s> No.  How far in one attempt -- what's the farthest someone like myself could walk?
<s> When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year.  I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be.
<s> Is that right?
<s> You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
<s> Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss you!
<s> Do it now!
<s> He'll not escape me.
<s> Sport, indeed.
<s> My own father...
<s> And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
<s> I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
<s> Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
<s> Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
<s> I'm very smart.
<s> You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
<s> Just call me Barney.
<s> I'll reschedule.  I've been working too much anyway.
<s> That's none of your fucking business.
<s> Mr. X, I was out there tonight. I saw what you did. I want to be a Muslim. I ain't never seen a Negro stand up to the police like that.
<s> I know you're not.
<s> Yeah? And if she was ugly?
<s> They're coming.
<s> No.
<s> No.
<s> You worship yourself.
<s> Okay, I think I could swing that.
<s> The truth.
<s> Sorry?!
<s> Now tell me... what do you see?
<s> You're sure?
<s> The fat man's scared. Scared of us, and scared without us. Same with Maranzano. We gotta get their minds back on each other. This fuckin' peace is killin' us.
<s> Never threaten me, Boss.
<s> I didn't say anything.
<s> Give me a date, Doctor.
<s> Goodnight, Jeff.
<s> It *is* not!
<s> No! Stop it!
<s> It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
<s> Yes, you own it.
<s> Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while?
<s> But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh—
<s> They are? I forgot all about them.  What do you think they want?
<s> What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
<s> Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.
<s> Mr. Gilroy --
<s> You were messed up, man.
<s> I understand what it's like to want to leave a problem behind. That's all most people are looking to do.  Mainly, I listen.
<s> Really?
<s> Yep.
<s> Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.
<s> Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
<s> My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.
<s> All right.
<s> Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
<s> Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.
<s> Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
<s> If we say that, Leon... we'll be sent to Siberia!
<s> It is unfortunate that you have so few more days in Paris.  Be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to Moscow.  Good night.  Good night, Leon.
<s> He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director.
<s> This could be it ... this could be it. Four long years ...
<s> What?
<s> Is that why you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
<s> Did you cry when he died?
<s> Well enough.  You're looking "happy," Nelson.
<s> You figure him for a dope runner?
<s> Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.
<s> It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
<s> Beer, please.
<s> Nobody. It just came to me.
<s> Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push.  Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself!
<s> Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
<s> I don't get it.
<s> They're hurting us, baby. Huey locked up. Bobby Seale running all over the country holding things together. Cy dead. Little Bobby... I don't recognize half the faces at meetings.
<s> Well...a touch of the flu...
<s> Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
<s> And Church will be fine.
<s> Oh yeah.  They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
<s> You're looking for a urine sample.
<s> The polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate.  So what's wrong?
<s> You were looking for us?
<s> Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening—
<s> I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
<s> You want to get out of here?
<s> I have no idea.
<s> Nothing, huh, do you know what I'm doing?
<s> Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
<s> I need help.
<s> Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them.
<s> Am I?
<s> Then find another theater
<s> I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.
<s> No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
<s> Mrs. Thorwald.
<s> Something too frightful to utter.
<s> Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--
<s> Yes.
<s> I don't know...
<s> Nothing... I promise-nothing...
<s> I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
<s> How many employees?
<s> What do you think?
<s> One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
<s> Whoa, Dwight, I say when we pull the plug. Get a hold of yourself. Dwight, we're on the verge of greatness and I'm about this close to getting laid. Now, the bus will be here on Monday. Until then no one leaves.
<s> I am Tom Green, I am Tom Green. Daddy want some sausage, sausage. Daddy want some sausage...
<s> No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
<s> Very much live.
<s> Then it's a good thing.
<s> Beautiful.
<s> Nah. I want to watch this.
<s> Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
<s> She doesn't answer me either.
<s> That's weird.
<s> I guess I put a good scare into him.
<s> Why?
<s> You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
<s> It wasn't working anyhow.  The scene with the thousand geese -- I don't understand this film.  I don't think anyone will understand it.  I already put out a press release -- citing "creative differences".
<s> ...Hi.
<s> I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry.
<s> This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor?
<s> Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
<s> Will she come back?
<s> Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
<s> Why?
<s> It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
<s> He's the grrrrreatest!
<s> You have elected me Security. The way things have been going in this Barracks, I guess I've done a poor job and I want to make up for it. Is that asking too much?
<s> ... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
<s> What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
<s> Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
<s> Permission to speak candidly, sir?
<s> Just a couple of kooks...
<s> Reading the patient's vital signs.
<s> They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
<s> Steady!!...  Now, Mr. Sulu!
<s> Roughly translated: puberty... although for a Klingon that's not doing it justice...  Any severe mood swings, unusual aggressive tendencies -- be sure to let me know right away...
<s> Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
<s> We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
<s> I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
<s> And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
<s> We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective.
<s> Can you - ?
<s> And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.
<s> They're dying.
<s> In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
<s> Understood.
<s> I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
<s> There is that.
<s> Yes?
<s> Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
<s> You may be a little overdressed for this party.  Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!
<s> Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way.
<s> Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
<s> Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
<s> Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes "ghosted," invisible.
<s> I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
<s> 213-555-4679. That's all. I just wanted to leave my number. I don't want you to think I'm weird, or desperate or something...  ...I mean, you know, we should just hang out. That's it. No expectations. Just, you know, hang out. Bye. 
<s> What?
<s> You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
<s> He owns the studio.  Just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book, a best seller.  And the main character is a guy just like me.  I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself.
<s> Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
<s> You know I love spaghetti.
<s> Michael you're trying to scare me...
<s> I love Marge.
<s> He's having an early night.
<s> I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome.
<s> My name is Travis.
<s> I musta been stoned.
<s> You know how I feel about what you do.
<s> You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
<s> No, it's okay.  See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?
<s> The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
<s> Well, all right, but...
<s> Thank you.  Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
<s> But can't you give me any idea?
<s> The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
<s> Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
<s> Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
<s> You ready?
<s> You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world.
<s> I thought you said they needed discipline?
<s> That's okay, Mom.  I can see it later.  I'll help you unload.
<s> Anyplace but here.
<s> Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
<s> How do you control the Morlocks?
<s> We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
<s> We never should have done this to him...
<s> Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
<s> Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
<s> No.
<s> Did you study under Kim Greene?
<s> Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
<s> Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.
<s> The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.
<s> I can't, Hoss. I don't talk to FBI's.
<s> At Sioux Falls Pen?
<s> The plane is fine.
<s> Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
<s> That's right.
<s> "No," what?
<s> Don Reynard.
<s> Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...
<s> It looks that way.
<s> Yes.
<s> I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
<s> I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.
<s> Yes. Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach San Pedro Sula, who is named after Cary Grant, and he told them there was a shooting.
<s> Seven tomorrow evenin'. We can eat at Galatoire's. Fix it.
<s> Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
<s> She got me an abortion...
<s> Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
<s> You think she's gonna make it?
<s> No...
<s> Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
<s> What's that?
<s> I could take you downtown.
<s> I'm not scared.
<s> No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.
<s> Tell me once more.
<s> You shouldn't always take me seriously. Actually, I'm used to it by now. First my mother and now my husband; both of them are like dynamos.
<s> Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
<s> Yes, she takes care of the garden.
<s> One of the other Sisters?
<s> Her headaches.
<s> Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
<s> The woman's health is at stake.
<s> If you believe this is murder, it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. And definitely not Agnes.
<s> Ah well. Eh, look!
<s> Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.
<s> We're coming up now, open the outer lock door.
<s> And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
<s> Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
<s> You should hit the sack, too.
<s> You've what?
<s> Nobody's perfect.  I'm glad you're out of it, Hannah-- you're a terrific reporter and I turned you into a bookkeeper.
<s> To cover up?
<s> --you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months.
<s> Forget it.
<s> Just in time.
<s> Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.
<s> He didn't?
<s> Yep.
<s> What about me?
<s> Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
<s> What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read "Death in Venice."
<s> I really enjoyed it.  Nice to have metcha. Good night.
<s> Escape hatch.  And Dad was having a go about the garden.  Something was misplanted...
<s> Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
<s> Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal
<s> So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
<s> It's an emergency -- see you some other time.
<s> Dreadful.
<s> I know, I know, it's all right. Come in this way. It's mined over there. This way. It's all right.
<s> Yeah, I know.
<s> What about an American named Kurtz?
<s> I met him.
<s> Straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where else you think he'd be?
<s> She's dead.
<s> Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake.  I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I am using the word "hate" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills.
<s> How're you doing?
<s> What?
<s> Average.
<s> I'll try not to, I'll leave that to you. Anyway, there's still plenty more of it.
<s> I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.
<s> Alright!
<s> Josh, I need your help. Doug's been arrested, he's in big trouble. I thought maybe your father and the Embassy might be able to do something.
<s> I'm sorry about how we --
<s> I'm really glad you think so.
<s> Sure thing. Come on.
<s> It's your play.
<s> You said that once already... Too late now.
<s> Yeah.
<s> You wanna take the chance, Casper?
<s> Arachtoid.
<s> They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
<s> Yeah, I met her already.
<s> You're not?
<s> Who said that?
<s> For real?
<s> Yeah.
<s> He <u>is</u> Batman, you moron.
<s> Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
<s> You have a real gratitude problem. You know that, Bruce? I need a name. Batboy? The Dark Earl? What's a good side kick name?
<s> Can't tell if you don't say please.
<s> Here. Get a good seat.
<s> ... A hundred and eight?
<s> Not necessarily.  That's where this ...  comes in.  No, I've had a better idea than sacking people.  You'll hear soon enough.
<s> Bork, don't you realize what kids today are capable of? Don't you read the papers?
<s> Hello, Ronald.
<s> ... Good evening, Louise.
<s> He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
<s> Hmmm.
<s> We'll talk about it in the car.
<s> I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
<s> I likes yellow.
<s> What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
<s> He's sleeping in the church.
<s> I run him off.
<s> Just me.
<s> Who is this?
<s> Strong men also cry. . . Strong men also cry.
<s> Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth.
<s> Two things.  One, I was on to you the moment they turned you.  And two --  I switched that dud of yours back with the real one.
<s> Not that I'm in contact with.
<s> You're joking --
<s> I'm not a witch, you're all crazy!
<s> Look, this is not my field of expertise. You seem stabilized, but why take any chances? Let's keep you overnight and have the Staff obstetrician do a follow-up tomorrow.
<s> The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
<s> I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
<s> Back where?
<s> What do you mean...
<s> . I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.
<s> Sometimes I think I do.
<s> Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
<s> Where do you guys want to count?
<s> Sit down, Frank.
<s> And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
<s> He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
<s> What?
<s> What?
<s> Yeah, in the land of the blind the one eye'd are king.
<s> That's your dream, Homes.  Not mine.  I don't want to leave this street.  Ever. The status quo is totally cool with me.
<s> Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
<s> He can't kill you --
<s> You are as radiant as ever, Violet.
<s> I won't forget this.
<s> I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?
<s> Take care.
<s> Used to be my partner.
<s> I'll see you back at the hotel.
<s> He said something about...
<s> Excited.
<s> Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
<s> Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.
<s> Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
<s> Right!
<s> Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
<s> Well shit, then, let's fuck.
<s> I know.  I just like to see you get all worked up.
<s> This is a very auspicious occasion.
<s> Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
<s> Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
<s> It's okay. Let her go.
<s> Lucky for them they didn't.
<s> They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
<s> Sure, like I'm gonna take advice from you.
<s> Hi.
<s> Hurling --
<s> Why?
<s> Charles is.
<s> I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
<s> Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
<s> So?
<s> How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
<s> You're the one who's hand is shaking.
<s> ...think he was a wacko.  And I think that G.I. ninja's a bigger wacko.  And I think you're the biggest wack-...
<s> Worth a try.
<s> 
<s> ...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar!  And let me tell you something else.  I didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
<s> Closin' down, sir.
<s> Radio the bikes.
<s> Just go check the temperature.
<s> What are you having?
<s> A check?
<s> More like other people putting their business in my nose.
<s> No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
<s> She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.
<s> Twenty-two; same as us.
<s> I don't want to talk to you.
<s> If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!
<s> You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> The down drafts would wipe her out.  It's the only chopper.  If it goes, you got no ride out.
<s> Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.
<s> Are you feeling better?
<s> Four in this block, sir.
<s> So?
<s> Doesn't cover everything.
<s> I'm willing to take that risk.
<s> Look at all this traffic. I'm not sure I can deal with it.
<s> Well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest...
<s> If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.
<s> Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
<s> Give me back my comb.
<s> It's time for me to leave it behind.
<s> I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
<s> You gonna wind up working at a school crosswalk.   that doughnut's chocolate you, know.
<s> I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
<s> It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King.
<s> It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
<s> But who will they turn to for help?
<s> No, I'm not.
<s> I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
<s> I still thought it was a purse.
<s> So what do I do?
<s> There's no mistake, Bill.   If you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake.
<s> Inside, Vince.
<s> That's who.
<s> Simon Doucet.  You are under arrest. Please come out with your hands in the air.
<s> <i>The money exchange will take place at Top of the World at the Stratosphere. Get there at exactly midnight.</i>
<s> <i>Here's the part where I'm supposed to get all defensive and say... 'not until I speak with my attorney.'</i>
<s> I'm not studying no Mayor.  Besides, he reminds me of my least favorite peoples.  My tenants and my ex- husband--Goddamn-bless his soul.
<s> I understand.
<s> Mookie, you're fucking up.
<s> What a nerd. I don't know where that girl's ever gonna find a husband.
<s> PRINCIPAL COLLINS is a greater American than George Washington will ever be.
<s> Not to expect you tonight.
<s> Checking up on my friend, Harry.
<s> They tried and died....  Jessica!
<s> I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.
<s> Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
<s> This is my thirteenth pair.
<s> Honey, I have a little secret to share with you.
<s> I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
<s> Yeah. The camera guy is here.
<s> Oh my God!!
<s> I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
<s> Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
<s> Me?  I took advantage of you?  You hugged me!  You kissed me!  You're the one who --
<s> If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I --
<s> And may I ask what could possibly be more important than Fawell Oil v. U.S. Environmental Agency?
<s> And you've forgotten yours.
<s> You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
<s> Damn, I knew I forgot something.
<s> But--
<s> What's wrong with him?
<s> Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
<s> Walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man...
<s> Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
<s> Are you a relative?
<s> You wanna get a drink?
<s> A few empty tables.  It's cozier. Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place on a Wednesday night.
<s> For a while.  She left.
<s> Okay.  How'd yours go?
<s> You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
<s> Not anymore.
<s> I’m not worried, Mom. He’s still learning our ways...
<s> What?
<s> You'd never know it.
<s> Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department.
<s> Thanks, hon.
<s> What do you want me to do?
<s> Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew a hole in his head.  Was that part of your plan?
<s> Then you believe all this??  That Death is working off a list?
<s> Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
<s> What are the other reasons?
<s> <u>Nothing!</u> <u>They</u> <u>can</u> <u>do</u> <u>nothing!</u> <u>Gentlemen!</u>
<s> Out where?
<s> Do you love me, Bobby?
<s> I think it's what you think.
<s> Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
<s> Precisely. Are you a good shot?
<s> Come here.
<s> What?
<s> What about finding the source?
<s> It's just beginning.
<s> Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
<s> He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
<s> I guess somebody beat me to it.
<s> Get it over with...
<s> Pull over.
<s> Yes. I can't help the way I am.
<s> I've...look.  Will someone get this guy off my back.
<s> Yes.
<s> I'm not hungry.
<s> You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie?  We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh...
<s> Kay... Kay...
<s> I can't let him down.
<s> Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
<s> At this moment, I feel no love for you at all.  I never thought that could happen, but it has.
<s> Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
<s> I'm not a kid.
<s> But we have to match the other sketch.
<s> My mind's lovely.  And yours?
<s> I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
<s> What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
<s> You mean I can't even get outa here?
<s> Would you describe their position as inflexible?
<s> Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
<s> Probably best. You may want to shoot yourself half way to Ohio.
<s> How many bodies did you find?
<s> Look where?
<s> Of course.
<s> I promise.
<s> I'm sorry.
<s> You know... 
<s> Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
<s> And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...
<s> Heather.
<s> I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die.
<s> I think so, man.
<s> But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.
<s> Oh, no. I'm watching my figure.
<s> Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other.
<s> Two.
<s> Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --
<s> There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
<s> There's nothing I can do.  I'll wait. One way or another soon it will all be over soon.
<s> I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
<s> What do you mean?
<s> Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
<s> It will do just fine.
<s> When?
<s> -- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
<s> We'll be there.
<s> Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports.
<s> Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
<s> Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
<s> I know that, Amy.
<s> Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it!
<s> Please, Wes, do as I ask.  You must rest, you must sleep.
<s> To the asylum?
<s> Too bad...
<s> No...
<s> Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
<s> Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?
<s> Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George?
<s> You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
<s> Let's not talk about that now, okay?
<s> They still seem nervous.
<s> Good.  I have two left....
<s> It’s not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.
<s> Who?
<s> This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
<s> Can I ask -- how you found me?
<s> Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
<s> Fine.
<s> It is alright, Father.
<s> Roughly five thousand men.
<s> I beg your pardon?
<s> No, I actually <u>want</u> to stay for a little while.
<s> What kind of backup do we have?
<s> Well... he didn't have to tell me that part.
<s> But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
<s> It...almost got you.
<s> Colt Peacemaker.
<s> Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
<s> No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
<s> Well, he's living proof of that, son. Living proof.
<s> That ring--
<s> Seems like we have another one every week.
<s> We don't need a new jail.
<s> You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.
<s> When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
<s> A coke.
<s> Something he said, just before...
<s> I think you gave me the wrong one.
<s> She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans.  Parents died when she was 13.
<s> It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
<s> I don't know, he had a meeting or something.
<s> I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?
<s> You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually?
<s> I don't have a boyfriend.
<s> -- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?
<s> And that's what you've heard?
<s> Is it over 'cause you're sick?
<s> -- I didn't see you from the window.
<s> Soon enough.  Here we are.
<s> Oh Louis, Louis...
<s> I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
<s> That's when it happened?
<s> Hi, Linda. ..
<s> That's true.
<s> Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
<s> You killed them.
<s> Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?
<s> No no, not you.
<s> Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.
<s> Good night to you, Bill.
<s> And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
<s> No --
<s> That's right I did, didn't I?
<s> Why are you following me?
<s> Transpo?  How they bringing the loads in...?
<s> Oh. Yes. Of course. I should have thought. You shouldn't have to ask. That was thoughtless of me. Yes. Wait here...
<s> Across both tracks!!
<s> That'd be a first.
<s> Hello, Mr. Castorini.
<s> You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
<s> What?
<s> Pop don't like Johnny.
<s> No, no ... not "is"!
<s> No, no, no.
<s> She's hardly a full hamper herself.
<s> To know when he'll be king.
<s> Getting there.  It's more sensitive than a joy-stick.  Your video-character can respond as fast as you can.  But what can I do for you?
<s> I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
<s> I'll speak to someone.
<s> Yeah, but we're talking 43.
<s> Well you know what I mean.
<s> Totally groovy huh?
<s> I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
<s> This is the street he walks down every day. When he needs inspiration...
<s> Uhh, Miss devoto...
<s> Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.
<s> Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
<s> Well, they removed my heart last week, but I'm doing fine except my nose fell off. Looks a little funny.
<s> What do you mean?  You said you wanted to see me.
<s> Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.
<s> Don't stop!
<s> Is that her real name?
<s> That's right.
<s> You're pleasant tonight.
<s> I thought you already left.
<s> Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
<s> What's my end?
<s> Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
<s> That's typical.  I hope she didn't expect to make the best seller list with this thing.
<s> Okay, I guess.
<s> But Max, she needs me.  It could mean life or death.
<s> I forgot my bag.
<s> But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
<s> You have a stunt bottom?
<s> Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...
<s> I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
<s> No...  I can just tell.
<s> What about your job?
<s> You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
<s> So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet.  Maybe there's something in there that might help us.  Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
<s> We're all desperate for the money, doll.  That's what made this country great.  Back me up on this Candy, am I right?
<s> What do they do for you, except get in your way?
<s> There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
<s> And the one driving the other car?
<s> Oh.  Uh-huh.
<s> Sure.
<s> Really.
<s> Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
<s> Hale-what?
<s> Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
<s> What facts are those?
<s> I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of.
<s> How, did you know about my grandfather?
<s> Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
<s> Well... many things. But I think the thing I love the most, is that every once in a while, not that often, but occasionally... you get to be part of justice being done. It's really quite a thrill when that happens.
<s> Isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you're not, so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?!
<s> I can't....I can't....
<s> I know what's in here!
<s> Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
<s> Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
<s> Where?
<s> Barnes comes from Hell.
<s> Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?
<s> De nada.
<s> So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
<s> Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
<s> The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
<s> You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
<s> How many could you handle?
<s> You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
<s> And after that we'll play the Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia ... And I'll play Lucretia.
<s> Must've needed it.
<s> It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
<s> Papers--they all want me to sign papers.
<s> You give me a pain!
<s> There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.
<s> Good night, sir.
<s> A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so --
<s> Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.
<s> ... okay... you made your point.
<s> Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
<s> No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
<s> Yes, I do.
<s> ...Adrian ain't sharp.
<s> Absolutely...
<s> Maybe ya should see a doctor.
<s> O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
<s> Because I owe you.  Look at that...
<s> Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
<s> I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
<s> And you ain't black!
<s> How do I know I can trust you?
<s> Any leads?
<s> Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
<s> You don't know what a shortcut is?
<s> With the FBI. What do you think I'm talking about?
<s> Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese --
<s> This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
<s> I know that.  You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."
<s> Pass.
<s> Since when have things been normal?
<s> Lloyd.
<s> I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
<s> Would it do any good?
<s> Home--where he lives.
<s> No, I don't.
<s> But...
<s> Sid I can see you!
<s> Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
<s> How do you gut someone?
<s> To my weekly confession.
<s> Will you shut up and play.
<s> Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
<s> Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
<s> Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
<s> What would my being a faggot have to do with that?
<s> Didn't you have any panties on?
<s> What did you do?
<s> -- just before I ask you out? I can't do that. Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again.
<s> Yeah! What is it?
<s> Oh no.  We'll always be together.
<s> Don't call again.  It's not safe.  I'll be in touch.
<s> Yeah...
<s> Listen.
<s> True enough.
<s> She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
<s> She did not do it... please listen...
<s> See, you made him somethin'. Hey Vaughan, I was just goin' on with you, jokin' around, buddy.
<s> Vaughan, don't get pushy.
<s> I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
<s> If he's got something to tell me, why don't he tell it to me himself?
<s> Eighteen and a half years.
<s> It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
<s> Sure.  I could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. Right above your left ear.
<s> Jerry-boy - why do you have to paint everything so black? Suppose you get hit by a truck? Suppose the stock market crashes?
<s> Terribly sorry.
<s> Yes, Joe.
<s> Shells?  Whatever for?
<s> I sleep with my spats on.
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> What?
<s> You could? How?
<s> Great, son -- not like wakin' up in jail. For a minute or two, didn't quite know where I was, but when I saw your face lookin down on me, made me know right away the day was gonna be a good one, and it all belonged to me!
<s> September 4 -- how far away is that?
<s> Then why don't he holler like he usta?
<s> -No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening?
<s> Mph rmph rm rmph rm.
<s> Mrph mprhm mm rmph!
<s> Yeah, but you know, I learned something today.  I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.
<s> Hey, come here, guy.
<s> It can't be.
<s> You didn't do anything to the monitors, did you Mac?
<s> Nah, I already ate.  Why don't you just go down there?
<s> Probably come through the wall I suppose.
<s> Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
<s> The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
<s> Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.
<s> His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
<s> You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  "Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.
<s> That far in what, Harry?
<s> You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
<s> We'll work it out...
<s> Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...
<s> <u>Pay</u> her.
<s> Only second chance we git, z'ta make the same mistake twice...
<s> I have lava.
<s> Brad Kovitsky.
<s> No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
<s> Hi, Dad!
<s> Shut up!
<s> What do you think of this, Mister President?  I told you we shouldn't let him in here.
<s> What? What do you stand for?
<s> Mm-mm.
<s> My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
<s> I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
<s> I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
<s> I've got things to do.
<s> How do you know?
<s> What? Me?
<s> The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and --
<s> But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!
<s> What's wrong?
<s> Gets you where you live, huh?
<s> Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...
<s> From what?
<s> But that wasn't your fault, dear, what happened to Leslie.  I've told you that a million times...
<s> ...but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic.
<s> Oh, God... Kyle.  I need you so much.
<s> No. Ours was damaged.
<s> What whistle?  There's no fucking whistle.  This is fucking dangerous.
<s> It was a different floor then...
<s> Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
<s> The whole thing feels like experimental misdirection.  Like he says it's about one thing, a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia... and that'd be a legitimate study, but I think that we've been subjected to an academic bait and switch; he's really looking at something else.
<s> It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer.
<s> Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
<s> What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
<s> How'd you manage that, then.
<s> Well? How'd she do?
<s> *Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never--
<s> He and Doris... were having an affair.
<s> I know who you are, Mr Crane.
<s> Homicide.
<s> Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.
<s> Get back!  Now!
<s> I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
<s> You're kidding me.
<s> That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy.
<s> What?
<s> Best thing that ever happened...
<s> But your man isn't quite a God!
<s> Find the Frenchman.  Find me Mayol.
<s> You say that because you have the title!
<s> Let's get in your truck.
<s> I was... I was trying to open this tin.
<s> Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
<s> You've only been playin three hours, Doyle.
<s> Had a little fight with a raggle down on 13th.  She got me with her ring.
<s> Which way did she fall?
<s> I'll check on that.  I'm afraid this is kinder dull for you.
<s> Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.
<s> Don't let them separate us.
<s> Where did you find it?
<s> What time is your rendezvous?
<s> Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
<s> I know all your tricks.
<s> What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
<s> Rose might not want to see this, Lewis.
<s> Sure. Count me in.
<s> You know where that sense of humor's goin' to get you one of these days--
<s> Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.
<s> Fishing?
<s> Fueled and waiting.
<s> And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
<s> Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
<s> Miss.  G-6.
<s> Well ... yes. All right. But -
<s> Almighty Jove in the shape of a swan.
<s> You're late for breakfast.
<s> You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
<s> So what's it going to be?
<s> Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
<s> That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
<s> No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
<s> We have to talk.
<s> Yep.  Sleep fast.
<s> Stay on him.
<s> He needed my help.
<s> Ssshhh!  We say Op.  Covert					* operation.  And this one got a little rough.
<s> It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.
<s> Look, Dick, I don't -
<s> This is it, James...what you've been working for.
<s> Stop it.
<s> Jesus!
<s> Vat? I am going 5 miles an hour! I am looking town. I not even moving.
<s> You assumed wrong.
<s> Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
<s> Huh? Uh... yeah.
<s> Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
<s> You didn't write that figure.  And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
<s> But Scottie, you don't have to!
<s> Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
<s> Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
<s> I don't think that's such a good idea.
<s> What'd ya think?
<s> Who's got the story? 
<s> Hmm.
<s> I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
<s> Not like this.  We were never like this.  I want to go over there.  After dinner, we can--
<s> Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.
<s> I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN. When I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped ELLEN, I can't carry on - I won't carry on. All I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance...You are good to me - you don't condescend, you're intelligent, and very beautiful...
<s> Cut it out, before you break something!
<s> Take a whiff of heaven.
<s> In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
<s> What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?
<s> Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me. First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law.
<s> Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab.
<s> Because – somehow – they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
<s> Not yet.
<s> Are you all right, Dorothy?
<s> Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
<s> She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And M’s life is part of the bet.
<s> You knew him well?
<s> I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
<s> I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
<s> So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that.
<s> I'm from L.A.
<s> Of course.
<s> If she held on any longer she could have.
<s> You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
<s> Could be raining!
<s> That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
<s> Yes.
<s> So, you got it in the line of dooty.. ... point taken.
