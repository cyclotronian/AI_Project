No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
You got something on your mind?
You know Chastity?
Have fun tonight?
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
Well, no...
But
Did you change your hair?
Where did he go?  He was just here.
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
You are so completely unbalanced.
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
I just wanted --
Patrick -- is that- a.
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
What if she never starts dating?
But she doesn't want to date.
No, but
I'm missing something.
How many people were in your old school?
That I'm used to.
You know French?
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You got him involved?
Number one.  She hates smokers
Her favorite uncle
What've you got for me?
What's the worst?
Leave my sister alone.
How'd you do it?
Hey.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
What's this?
You think this'll work?
What'd he say?
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
Excuse me?
Okay?
I thought you were above all that
And I'm in control of it.
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
Wholesome.
Yes
You up for it?
What?
I know.
Why can't we agree on this?
As a parent, that's my right
Bianca did what?
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
Tempestuous?
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Kat a fan, too?
What plan?
What?!
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
In the microwave.
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
Have a great time, honey!
He's the devil's child...
Senor Colon, an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew.  I am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment.
The State has some reason to be interested in this man's proposition, Your Eminence...
They took everything...
Can't you stay with us a little?
How are you feeling, Fernando?
They don't see sin in their nakedness.  They live according to nature, in a never ending summer. The islands are covered with trees, filled with blossoms and fruits. And...
All I have to do is call the guards.
You have to find them, Utapan.  Look what they did!
Diego is a bright boy -- a pleasure to teach -- but so serious... Brothers should be raised together, Colon.  Even brothers from different mothers...
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
I suppose we're both old men now.
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
You lied!  You cheated!  We're way past 750 leagues!
You tell that to them!
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
Oh no!  No!  Shit!
...delusions and paranoia.
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
What about back home?
A cop?
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Oh.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
Who did cause and origin?
No!  Nothing happened.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
You know what that is, right?
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
What would you call her?
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
My folks are.
Two heads.
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.
Why not?
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
I kill someone famous.
Is it drug related?
Alright.
Hey, honey.
Okay, til tonight.
Sooner or later that's everybody.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
How old are your kids?
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
Hi, I'm Honey.
Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?
In here, says he wants a million.
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
Don't fool around.
No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!
You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
I'm serious.
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
We spent it!
I can get you a job.
Yes, the money is good.
We started over, you can too.
Viewer discretion advised!
Yeah?
I'll take him.
Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy?
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
Bobby, Bobby!  Where're you hit?!
This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE
CONTINUED
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
It's about my salary cheques.
How?
It's the last one.
I guess not.
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
CONTINUED
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
Thank you.
Yeah?
Name?
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
Pay money?
I never paid for it in my life.
I'm candy...
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
You're in a hurry.
I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay?
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
You're gonna help us take him.
I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
What do you think?
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
Hey, you wanna bet?
Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
Half a million.
You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
That was quick.
Hey, how'd my car get here?
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
How did they get away?
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Doesn't look like it.
I got to wait for a call.
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
Hey, you're right.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Just one.  Some lady called.  Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
No wonder you're so popular.
Hello.
Three more hours...
You sure?
How about some ammo?
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
We have to save the world.
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
What are we going to do?
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
I don't have time... I need to know.
I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
Hello?
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
...Priest...
Eto Akta Gamat!
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
When EVIL returns so shall we.
Hi Ma...
Other than that... You all right?
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
I'm sorry..
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
Solid little jobs, aren't they?
Apipoulai!
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
It's up to you now, Angel!
Not going to open?
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
Have you identified it?
...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
Snuff?
A fellow investor.
I want to watch you work.
What's the problem?
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
You got the guts, tough guy?  Gonna kill us all, is that it?
I figured you share information.
Yeah, who's this?
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
Yes, I do have something to say.  I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
You're asking me why?
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?
Who is he?
What's this?
Have a pleasant evening.  Will you have tea, Mister Welles?
Pittsburgh?
Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...
Okay...
One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents...
Okay.
Hello?
How are you?  Having any luck?
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
Why do you think he did it?
I had to ask.  I apologize.
I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...
Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.
Yes... I remember Mary
Do you know what happened to her?
Her belongings?
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
No, sir, he is not.
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
Rick...I can't.
Then you saw him, too?
How long have you been awake?
Alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. Why does Freddy all of a sudden need you?
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.
Enough of that crap.
Been up with Alice.
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
Something wrong with the stairs?
What?
I gotta get out of here.
You don't get it, he's after me...
Excuse us, dear.
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
Is that who you're waiting for?
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
Mommy...?
But how...?
The tickets.
Thanks for everything, Dad.
Alice!
What's that got to do with it?
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
Are you alright?
You do good work, Alice.
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
I've got to write some of this down.
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
I don't understand.
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do.  I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
Have another one, sounds like you need it.
How is he - ?
What is it?
My father!  He's not - ?
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
That's enough, Holloway.  I've told you before, wearing boards on your shoulders, and parading with a stiff spine doesn't auto- matically endow you with back- bone - !
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.
Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
You hear that?
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
What about down?
You better take Powell and Carney with you --
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
Thought you were going to Washington, Skipper.
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
'Doctor' Neilsen?  When did <u>that</u> happen?
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
He did!
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
Well, I'll be - !
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
Always has been.
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
Chub says you're fired.
I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father.
This spring.
Yes.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
He's on to us!
You might not kill it.
I'm okay.
I used to play ball.
They said.
Don't mind if I do.
No brag. Just fact.
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
Like you and Gordon?
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
Saw him do it?
Open the door. We're late.
Yeah. It's stupid.
Jesus, why?
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
Are we going in this?
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
What do you want, then?
We're looking for the funniest costume! And the scariest! And the most imaginative! And the best costume of all!
Tomorrow, Gordon.
Don't go playing policeman.
How you holding up, Wade?
I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
Want to buy?
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
See. Get your boots.
You okay?
I'm sorry.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
You've been married twice --
This is nuts.
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.
You're not using it today?
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
What the hell are you talking about?
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
Who are you?
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
Who?
No shit.
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
Well, do you still plan to get married?
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
I don't know. You tell me.
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.
Mom?
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
Fuck off, you stupid asshole.
How was...  ...the ballet?
How you doing, sweetie?
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
There they are!
The pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
Two and three are heading toward the Boeing.
How we doing, Colonel?
Aw, man. You're torn up pretty bad out here, sir. Do you have any elevater control.
They aren't answering their hails.
Sir, you threw out page two.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally meet you in person.
Why? Do you enjoy it?
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
Stop.
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
The fax machines.
Someone should give you a raise.
One.
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
It's bait.  Don't take it.
Mr. President... they're ready for you in the conference room.
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
WE'RE HOOKED!
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
What's the story?
Kruger, Sagittarius.
Oveur.
Shut down accelerators.
Ted!  What are you...?
Elaine.
Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
Elaine!
Elaine, what's going on?
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
You folks need any help?
All right, it's a matter of death.
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Excuse me, are you alright?  I noticed you talking to yourself.  I'm a nurse.  Can I be of some help?
No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
Captain, how soon can we land?
What was it we had for dinner tonight?
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
What's the matter?
What's his problem?
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
Airsick?
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
Good-bye, darling.
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
Oh, I can't stand it.
Yes?
Roger.
We have clearance, Clarence.
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.
Do you feel all right, sir?
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.
I like my horizons narrow.
We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
You don't have squat.
Get the picture?
I believe I should interview the widow alone.
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time...
Why did you do it?
Matthew, you don't have to-- .
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?
Who is he?
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.
Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.
... and so, and so the doctor says, "If this is the thermometer, then where'd I leave the pen?"  You're not... you don't think that's funny?  George, work with me, I always get a laugh with that one. Look, if the doctor's got the thermometer in his hand, then where's his pen gotta be?
What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it.
Uh, George...
How do I look?
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
Yeah, Sykes?
You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk.
Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see Kristin get married, okay?  But--
Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?
...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.
I've isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  It seems to be metabolizing.  He should wake up soon.
Could it be intelligent?
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...
We're not making that out too well.  What is it?
Well you're not reading it right!
Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure.  They killed him getting it off.
They're in the approach corridor.
Now many?
Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
Fifteen meters.
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
What did you say?
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.
Now you just lie here and have a nap.  You're exhausted.
Gone.
Are we going to sleep now?
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish!
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
Where?
Oh!
Did you know? Had you heard?
What?
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
And how will you make him keep it?
If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me.
No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
Where?
That's stupid.
Oh, ha, ha, ha.
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
I think you're mad! You're really mad!
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
What's the matter with you?
Wolfi!
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
No. Don't answer it!
How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
Really?
Then he didn't send you?
What are you doing here?
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
This is not his handwriting.
Behold!
Upstairs.
What a strange young man.
Really?
Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in?
Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
Sire.
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
Well, what do you have for me today?
Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted.
Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving!
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
Where does he work?
Is he working?
I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German.
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
Leave that alone!
Put it down!
Yes.
No.
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
Well, your pupil is married and living in Mannheim, young man.
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?
Mio caro Adone.
Love, Sire!
How could I not?
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
Herr Sommer.
Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage.
They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
Ah. Italian?
How fortunate.
With all my heart, Mozart.
Yes?
You flatter me.
I have come to commission work from you.
Where is your wife?
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?
But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed.
Where did I stop?
Confutatis Maledictis.
Do you have it?
What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.
Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.
Exactly. A dance.
Is the Emperor angry with me?
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
Well done, Mozart. Really quite fine.
What do you want?
How well are you trained in music?
Where?
What?
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
That lady is back, sir.
But he's all right?
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
How did he look?
Go about your duties.
What exactly did he call out?
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.
It's a full moon. Where is he?
Surely you're not suggesting...
Could you get here without any trouble?
Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
You haven't eaten your lunch.
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
Aw come on, Miss Price!
How old are you?
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
But, David.
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.
But...
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
I looked.
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
There's no call for that kind of language.
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
Yes.
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
I really don't know.
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
Right.
Beware the moon?
Heathcliffe.
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
Come on, where?
It's moving.
It's in front of us.
Nice doggie. Good boy.
Jack?
You really scared me, you shithead.
If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.
You're not real.
What are you doing here?
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
Jack, are you really dead?
Dr. Hirsch?
You were saying?
What here?
Do you have any hot soup?
Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
Hello, Tom.
Tom, I never had trouble getting credit from you before. When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted. Now I come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest—
What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
Oscar, what's the matter?
Where you been?
What's the matter, Charlie?
Mr. Dickson in yet?
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!
Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
Say, you can't do that—
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.
You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you?
Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I—
What do you mean?
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks—
Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
Why, Cyril, you're insane—
No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
I'm feeling fine this morning.
What's the matter dear? What have I done now?
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!
Helen!
But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.  Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is—
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
You're lying!
The lobby's half filled now.
The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.
He's at a board meeting.
No.
Well . . . ?
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
Oh, Matt . . .
They must have turned him down.
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.
Did you say Dude Finlay?
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you?
So you were home last night?
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
Uhh, yeah it does.
This is the best score yet.
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
How'd they --
I ain't done --
I swear --
Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.
"The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."
Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go...
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
You shut up now, boy.
Home, boys. Back to our farms.
Hands off your hip, Cole.
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
She had a moustache.
I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money.
I got seven thousand.
It's not a bank.
Beautiful.
Bob, rip up some bandages.
Missed you, cousin.
Another dozen out back.
The safe. Now.
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
Fine. I'll just wait here.
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
Where the hell were you?
You know you're welcome any time!
He's going to be fine, right Daddy?
They're gone. What are you --
Distracting enough for you?
All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
Can't argue that.
Uncle Frank?
Did you kill Yankees?
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
You shouldn't be up.
You're sick of my company?
Teasing you is completely unfair.
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
Don't swear.
Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
You cocky little bastard.
I like that.
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile.
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
On a lot of lithium?
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
This is Dorsia?
Pull out, goddamnit!
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?
What are you doing tonight?
Patrick?
You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?
This is nicer than your other apartment.
We should do it.
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
He's good-looking.
He has a great body
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
We need to talk.
But what about the past? Our past?
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Don't come back.
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
Don't, I'll drink it.
Dorsia, yes?
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
Oh? And what should I say?
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
What is it?
Ye-es, Je-an?
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
Do you have a boyfriend?
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
Jean? What?
Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.
Yeah.
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
Coffee?
You sure?
How well did you know him?
Where did Paul hang out?
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don.
So...you hang out here a lot?
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance?  Which was on the twentieth of December?
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.
Yes.
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?
Listen, what's your name?
Shhhh...it's okay.
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
Hey, Halberstam?
You don't wanna move, do you?
If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.
To our new life.  ...What's wrong?
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.
It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top.
You think I don't know that?
It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back.
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
That was -- different.
Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?
That'll be a test, won't it?
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
Okay.
What?!
Milo? I'm Danny.
...Hello?
When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 --
No! Just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself.
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
It's okay. Really.
You did this -- overnight?
Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...
Gary, hi.
"Dear Lisa. I've enjoyed working with you. I'd be lying if I didn't say I find you attractive. But in my heart I know that Alice..."  You left my party to send E-mail?
I'm pretty close. But when I wrote the last contact switches, it wiped out a piece of the content filer. You know what it's like, writing software.
Just thought his work should go on.
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
Lisa.
Did I say something?
What've you got there?
Did you wanna be alone?
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
That's great. I -- didn't know.
...Milo?
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
How close are you?
We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.
Why were you so careless?
Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.
They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop?
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
Gary's not into fiber optics. He's betting everything on the satellites.
Who're these guys?
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
I'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it.
I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
Where am I?
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
When do I begin?
Oh, and Austin...
Excuse me?
Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
What's wrong with your hand?
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
I've got you, Dr. Evil!
My meat and two veg.
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!
Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
Not in the Nineties.
Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
Hello, luv.
Who?
No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
Thank God, Austin, we made it.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
Austin, I'm coming with you.
I have something to tell you.
Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three. We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle.
Ahhhhhhhhh!
We've got a lot of work to do.
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
What did you say?
Umm, that also has already happened.
Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
What about his teeth?
Did you ever...
We don't judge here.
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.
... death ...
May I help you, madam ...
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...
How curious ...
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
Who?
This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going?
You.
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
Think of this as your second wedding feast ...
The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.
Much better.
I didn't. Mother did.
I thought we were on our way.
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
But why? What's the point?
Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
Three agents killed by bad weather...
But you did suspect me.
You're playing games.
I told Mother I took care of you.
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful.
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
Aren't you coming?
What's that you're wearing?
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.
You don't believe him?
The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...
'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...
Think she really killed those agents?
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole.
Let it be rain, please let it be --
Aren't you forgetting about something?
Look at that guy. What a hunk.
You're kidding.
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
All right!
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.
I don't want any trouble.
I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
Hello?
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?
Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
Cole?
Cole, we've got to talk.
Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
Huh? Wha...
I don't know... I just feel scared.
That feels so great.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
I can't trust you!
Are you okay?
Let's go.
This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
You've been having strange sex...!
What's the matter?
Don't you love it when old friends stop by?
I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
Right in there, pal.
How'd it go?
Hey, you guys...
What are you going to do about it?
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?
-- Knock it off!
Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.
-- He killed people --
It doesn't go like that.
In the Field Museum once.
There's only so much technology can do.  Thanks for the beer.
Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...
Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.
Thanks.
Roll the hose.
What, is it the stairs? Christ, I'll let you win next time.
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
You okay?
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.
...Not now, Brian.
Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.
-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --
-- What were they doing there?
Brian.
I work for city hall.
Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
Brian. What's wrong?
I was doing my job.
Hi.
Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?
Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
-- No no, your turn. Tell me a story.
You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.
I need another one, sir.
-- Shhh.
Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...
Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue.
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
What the hell are you doing here?
Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are...  Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.
Nice bunch of guys.
Your brother was a good man.
Four months?
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
Every little boy's fantasy.
Mr. McCaffrey...
Y'know what Stephen said to me, right when all the shit was coming hard? "You never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it".
What?
Really. Well, let's have a look at what else was "in your blood". I always look forward to getting these, they make such a nice collage for the bar... "Assistant Director, Sales, Aspen Snowmobile Tours..."
They're waitin' man.
Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
Cook and I are almost finished here. Have a seat.
They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. Burns almost completely away when you light it.
Didn't think you'd make it.
Sure Ronald? You're ready alright.
-- Burn them.
Alderman Swayzak.
We still haven't found a connection between the victims.
I'm a little busy right now --
Susie's not a virgin anymore.
C'mere. You got some good blow, right?
You took the chalice.
There. Now you've got your profit and more. You'll have more product day after tomorrow, right?
Large?
I got them all going for Oakland. With bullshit money. We'll cover the $800.
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!
How's the case going?
-- that there was never any other way it could have gone.  Never any other way. So you had better just put in my fucking bet. $120,000 on the last game. The Big One. Come on! Are you a bookmaker, or fucking what?
Forgive me Father, for I have sinned. It has been two days since my last confession. Father, my sin is a terrible sin. A sin of omission. There was another sin that happened at the same time, and in the same place, but my sin I think was graver stil.
Keep trying.
My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
You don't have the demographics.
Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.
Certified ladies' man, huh?
Seconds and thirds, too.
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
So that's what you been doing?
What kind of show is this gonna be?
What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street.
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
Four minutes ago.
The material you've been creating is too white bread.  White people with black faces.  The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's dead.  We can't go down that road again.
What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
Word!!!
Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.
And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive.
I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this.  This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing "Amos and Andy."  Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain.
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone.
I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
What do you want?
Son.  Good to seeya.  Good to seeya.
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
Enough about me, what's happening with you?
I love you too, Daddy.
Nobody told me anything.
Manray was under our nose the whole time.
You lost me.
This is the group I was telling you about.
What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest.
What is this?
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
This thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in.  Could Don King be near?  Good thing Sloan had my back.  She's my rock.  This was going to be a whole lot of work.
You feel good, not nervous?
No joke.  Serious.
You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
You must think I'm some kind of fool.
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
Finland.
A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
Let Myrna finish.
Yes you!
So what's up with you and DeLa?
Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
I heard ya lady is wild.
...yes she did.
...perfect...
A lot?
Oh you do, huh?
Why don't you call him?
Both of us ride home with Best here.
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might.  But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him.
Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.
And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
I believe they will deport you.
I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.
Never.
Not one.
Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.
How so?
Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.
My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?
That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me.
Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.  One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth.
Charming Schuvaloff.
Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me.
Hurricane kept you up, too?
Bill Styles...
You killed him you fucking faggot --
Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
You saved Kendall's life --
He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
What about the phosphorous grenade?
Cadet, what's your name!
Roberto, what the fuck?
Bullshit.
Full clip to the body --
My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.
Somebody emptied a full clip into him --
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
How do you know?
You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!
The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?
You mean not enough to save you.
Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.
You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.
Is Dunbar cute?
You're kidding.
West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.
I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong --
I didn't shoot West...
Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.
Dunbar.
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
Buttfucks the cabin?
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
What?
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
So what now?
For what?
That's not true.
You're a good man, Hardy.
Nah.
A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.
I don't think I want to hear this --
They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --
Who, Levi --
Whoever shot the Sarge blew a grenade first --
Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of here --
This is totally unnecessary --
You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.
Great, great. That's fantastic.
I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one. And I may not have much, but I have more determination than any man you're ever going to meet.
Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over, so you better hurry.
I have to leave. Tonight.
This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
Fine, you do it.
You get the eye?
Bloom!
Can I see him?
Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
Yeah.
You must be Edward Bloom.
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
What did she say?
You know anyone's who's taken it?
You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
I thought you weren't dying.
The maple tree and the Buick. We heard it.
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.
I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.
Daffodils?
How can I convince you to stop?
I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
This is why you don't show work in progress.
It's me. Norther Winslow.
I don't believe it!
Are you Jenny Hill?
Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.
Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.
Do you love your father?
How did you get here?
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
Josephine and I have a lot in common.
Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important.
Is he awake?
So you never bought any land.
When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid?
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
Yes.
What's this?
Do you like it?
I need to know who you are first please.
You must have a visa or something...
She says she has a secret to tell.
How is bank?
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
He wants the money from your bank.
Just leave her alone.
It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"?
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
Syevodnya?
They go. John. They go.
In the world.
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
What?
Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
I don't hate you.
And who says what is wrong.
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
I got what I paid for.
It wasn't what I wanted.
You are pretty naive if you think it is.
Have you had any before?
You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
I don't want anyone to die.
Yeah. No thanks.
Whatever.
Is the flight full?
You have excellent English.
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
Is your niece older than 12?
Thank you.  Oh. My wife. She had a card here for her migraine pills. She ain't gonna be around no more... So if you...
This was very sweet of you.
Laz. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm gonna do it knowin' all too well I can get hurt like this. And I have been hurt. Just like you.  Woman like me, I got a lot of livin' to do. But my days are precious to me. They all I got left. Don't want no more fuss. I want love in my life. You understanding me, Laz?
Sit down, man. Need a beer?
I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it.  These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school...
And then you had to fall in love with the school slut.
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.
God forgive you, for how you done me...
Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!
You testing me? Huh? You testin' me, old man?
GODDAMMIT, RAE!
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
Don't... don't say that to me...
Teh... Tehronne?
Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE!
You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.
You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.
Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  Sting a bit?
The seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of God... and understand the word of God. Not enough for you to hear what I'm sayin', you gotta understand.
Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?
Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you...
Could you do somethin' for me?
My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it.
What is it?
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
Why's his britches round his knees?
The hell is this shit?
You won't at the square this mornin'.
What happened in there... that won't your fault. Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.
I skipped lunch.
Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet but... anyway, I got sick.
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
What?
What happened to your face?
You got any money?
Alright. How much you need, ho?
What's this?
Why?
What are they doing now?
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
Nick... You up?
Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.
This should be it...
Joyce can be nice.
What does Ichiro mean, anyway?
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever.
What happened?
You must leave?
How'd you get this?
Know her?
What'd I tell you?
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
Yakuza.
If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend --
Because he knows how to get to our man.
Someone attacked him.
Thank you.  You have one?
Louder, pal, louder.
Don't be an ass.
I need your help, Joyce.
And I'm supposed to care?
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
We're in?
Might be different in New York.
How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this.
I took Kobo from the street.  I gave him a home, a future... But my ways were too slow for him... I served seven years in prison for my boss when I was a young man.  Kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his Oyabun.  He was supposed to take over this syndicate when I retired.
You trust me?
If I say no?
I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary?
One man.  He must be good.
What's the problem?
I want more life, fucker.
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
I think, therefore I am.
You got a machine on it yet?
I was just about to have my dinner.
She was gonna get away.
Yeah.
You equipped for random questions?
You start.
What about a summary then.
Thank you very much.
How long you had these guys?
You like to kiss her goodbye.
My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?
Nerves of steel.
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
You're going to be over the limit.
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
Are you for real?
The best.
I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
Why not?
Is there anything else?
There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
Where is he?
What do people do in the afternoon?
When was the last time you cleaned this place?
But then how can you...
Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.
Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard.
We're going to have to start the sequence again if you don't stay with me, Deckard.  Concentrate.
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
I'm hungry, J.F.
Beautiful.
Get out of here!
It was amazing.
Why are you doing that?
Watching television in color.
Wait! Wait!
I guess we'll need another locker.
There's something else I would like you to help me with.
Bites what?
I was wrong!!
Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question?
Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way.
In the house?
The what?
Hey, Eve!
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
What about her?
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
Really?
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
What?
Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.
That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
...I do.
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roulÈ!
These are wonderful.
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?
Uh-huh.
I love Lucy!
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
Not on him.
What?!
What?
Bye, Troy!
The hotel.
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
Oh, that would be wonderful!
I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.
Elbows, Son.
Well, where are you --
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
All back East.
He drank it hot?
So...you...survived the blast, did you?
Well, put it down and come in!
No.  They all do.
You hear that?!
How long will we have to stay down here?
Thirty -five years!
Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!
Is there a problem?
I've noticed.
Watch this!
What did you wish for, Adam?
One who doesn't glow in the dark.
If we still have one.
Yes, yes it is!
They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't.
I don't know.
I see "elegant."
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
To bed?
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
And if we can't find him?
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.
What color is it?
Okay, come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Do you like that?
Do you like me?
I made it go down the toilet.
Then don't talk about killing.
What do you want to do?
Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.
Shut up.
I love you Don with all my heart.
You what?
I'm glad you do.
Yes.
Oh no.
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
They hurt his head.
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.
Look at these. What are these?
Hello?
No thanks.
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
What time are visiting hours?
I'm going out for awhile.
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
He comes over to study.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
No.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Are you feeling okay?
Good to see you, son.
Oh yeah?
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
So, what's next?
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
Brilliant.
Yeah, but.
OK.
Okay, thanks.
Well, how did it go? What happened?
You saw a lot in one night.
Did you see her undressed?
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
Okay, be careful.
Okay, okay.
Shoot.
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
Jeffrey? Why?
You didn't tell him about me?
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
It's okay.
You want to dance?
Dorothy!... Dorothy!
Up where?
Fuck you.
Hey, I just...
Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.
Chest pocket.  Shit!
Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?
What are you saying?
No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out!
What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview.
I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.
What the fuck are you doing?
What? What is it?
Shit.
I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.
We're alive.
All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?
Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya?
Nervous?
See. I told you there'd be a shaft.
Where the fuck are you going?
There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
Yeah?
I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!
Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?
So, what do we do now?
They were wearing masks.
Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... 
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
So what are you thinkin' here?
The what man?
And the pennies?
Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote!
Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
Chief, what the fuck is this?
What if it was just one guy with six guns?
What the...?
Oh my god!
This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?
Hello?
Roc. You okay?
Worst day of my life, man.
Hello? You there?
Yes.
You gonna do what I say, got it?
Just be natural, goddamit.
Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.
Continue the joke.
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
What color hair does he have?
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
What does Starsky say?
Anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. That's less than what it's appraised at.
The list, Dignan. I know you remember the list because you signed it. "Things Dignan was not supposed to touch."
Where are you going?
Did you see that?
Holy shit.
Yeah.
Well, then cut it in half.
What about them?
I'll just say it.
Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
Which one was that?
See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.
That coward. Son of a bitch.
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
I think we better go home.
When'd you get back?
What time did he say to be here?
Dignan. Take it easy.
Shit, Dignan.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
He was a nice guy.
Do you like Inez?
Yeah. As a girl.
What's happening? What's going on?
Help me move him.
Wait for Kumar.
What?
What are you talking about?
Dignan, it's too late.
Like amnesia.
You got to be kidding me.
You're living on a sailboat?
How big is it?
Where?
I think I may have found a way out of here.
When we go through the next gate you'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower guard.
Tell me something. What the hell kind of name is Dignan?
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.
That was a test?
I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?
Are you afraid?
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car.
Why not?
Yeah. Let's keep it --
No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
Jesus, Bob.
We think Mr. Henry maybe --
It's in the driveway.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
That's Anthony.
You don't celebrate til it's over.
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
They are.
You stole a Trans-Am.
How much could you grow? Realistically.
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
Did we get it?
Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a bag!
Way to go, Bob!
Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?
Is he chasing us?
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
How long has he been in there?
Give me the keys, Dignan.
Yes, I do.
Right. It was extremely stupid.
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
Bob, you're lying!
Come on!
That's OK.
Scarecrow?
I said to the DA, That cop who hit me must of given me CRS disease.
Do they let you --
How long do you have to go?
Why?
Is that your chiquita?
What?
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap...
...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
So what's he doing? You believe him?
Sorry to wake you.
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
Who else knows about this?
Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]
That's not what happened to your parents.
It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.
You still should've moved.
What do you want?
Try again.
Pamela Landy?
-- car keys?
You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
But you're sure?
...but you're not -- you're not sure...
You drive.
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
And you got to him before we could.
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
It's me.
What do you want?
-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.
Alright... take it down.
We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.
Still...
How long have you worked for the agency?
Amnesia?
I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions?
So he fooled you.
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
Someone dead from this household?
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
We'll sleep here tonight. You'll come home with me. We'll let the house, and the lands too; plenty of willing neighbors.
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
What are they doing?
Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council.
Does anyone know his politics?
The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
He won't come.
What news of the north?
Wallace has sacked York!
What is it?!
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.
Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.
Rest, William.
I don't want to be a martyr.
Test of manhood.
I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
You'll move
Good to see you again.
All right, Father, I'll ask him!  If I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?
My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen. So he accepted our bribe.
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
Your father doesn't like me, does he?
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
I want... to marry you!
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
I am the Princess of Wales.
You have... you have a husband.
War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
No dances, just tell me.
All the dads are gonna be there.
No.
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
Please, mom. People will talk.
Just tell me if anything weird happens.
Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?
Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.
Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
Not since we were kids.
Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.
I know, but...
Where... where are my clothes?
Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?
Why are you doing all this for me?
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
What's happened to you?
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
There's one major hole in your story.
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
And...?
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
Just don't drop the ball, okay?
Leave us alone you sick fuck!
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
How long have you been married?
Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
I'd better be going.
Hello, Rick.
What do you want for Sam?
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?
A franc for your thoughts.
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
It's been a long time.
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
Goodnight.
What happened with Rick?
Ask me?
I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.
We'll come again.
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?
Well, this might come in handy.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.
But we made a deal.
Everything in order?
Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!
Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that, Mademoiselle.
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
I believe you have a message for him?
You will give us the names?
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.
The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?
I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
This is the end of the chase.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
I have my orders.
Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.
Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans?  Rick, have you got these letters of transit?
As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist.
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.
Uh huh.
Give me another.
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
I would advise you not to interfere.
Get me the Radio Tower!
Huh. You know, Rick, watching you just now with the Deutsches Bank, one would think you'd been doing this all your life.
One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please.
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.
What's that you're playing?
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
It's bad.
Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south.
They're never going to see you.  You're just another piece of trash in the ocean.
It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
You can't make it.
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.
Yeah.  A long time ago.
No.  that was the last one.
Keep painting.  Promise me.
Did you really steal a crippled kid's bicycle to make your deliveries, or is that just some bullshit story?
My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.
How was Russia?
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
Got to follow the paper path here.
Look, I love the puppy.  I love you.  But I have to go.
"We're" not over-reacting.
No.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
I got married.
What's that, written on the sail?
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
You okay?
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
I love you, Chuck.
Yes, yes he did.
Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.
Thought you were going to bring her.
Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here...
When'd you start working here?
Trying.
Okay.  After three years the PTR reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the CPC.  Here it is.  Ten packages from the same sender.  Baku. Delhi.  St. Petersburg.  The guy was a real road warrior.  This package was Kuala Lampur.  No activity in his account after this package.  No forwarding addresses after K.L.
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
I didn't know we had sailboats.
Cool ropes.
When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.
I'm serious.  The burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon...
Digital laser readers.
Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.
You want that delivered, we'll deliver it.  That's what we do.
Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office.
This is *your* life story, Wilbur! You just changed the dates!
Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?
Why not?
What'd she die of?
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
So, Mrs...
Is your family in the apple business, too?
People watched the movies in their cars?
But you looked as if you liked it.
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...
But you had so much *responsibility*.
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
I *know* this was right.
Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.
"...did." Well, okay.
Do you think she'll be all right?
This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot.
I love you, Wally.
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
Did you know your mother better?
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
Has anyone offered you anything to eat?
Where are you going?
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
It's almost like flying.
That's better. I can tell you got yourself some education. Them's good hands you got, Homer. Them hands you got, they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right?
I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
Homer, don't you know what business you in? You don't wanna go into no business with me, Homer--ain't that right?
But she's your *daughter*...
I'm stayin', Homer.
If that was your knife, Muddy, I wanna thank you for givin' it to her-- no girl should be goin' *hitch-hikin'* if she don't got a good knife with her.
Okay, he's just a Wilbur then.
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer.
Uh... sure.
Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.
You okay, Rose?
Shit. We don't know what he is.
I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'.
When the plane was hit, the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together. The copilot jumped third. All on Captain Worthington's orders-- the captain was still flying the plane. None of the men of the ground could see the sky--that's how thick the jungle was. They never saw the plane crash--they never *heard* it crash. They never saw Captain Worthington's parachute, either.
You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that.
*What* view?
Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.
I told him that you all is sick.
She's *good* with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her?
Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.
Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.
Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.
It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.
I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.
Keeping the Fix happy.
Is that what it was, Jake? Was it love?
Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.
Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.
Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.
It can buy you a new and better you.
How much we going after?
We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need.
Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.
You'll be there?
Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
Excuse me?
Come on. Harder.
Don't get me wrong, Jake. I like you boys. You guys are the steadiest business in town. But what can I say? Twenty percent's still better than what we give to any of the other criminals.
That tip not work-out for you fellas?
Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?
What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?
Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
Mr. King, I think --
What the hell's his problem?
We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...
No, we never got busted. We were done with a shift one night, both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know? I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him.  What the hell was his name?
Why?
Uh...
Him.
What do we do? We change the scam?
What'd he say?
He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?
Sorry. What?
Do you have any idea what those monks charge for that medieval torture?
The King, huh? Nice going.
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
He's headed towards the eastern most exit. Do not, under any circumstances approach. I want to follow this all the way down to Vig.
Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
Jack. Do you need a ride?
But don't worry, I'm clean as a whistle. I only did S & M.  No blow jobs. No screwing.
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.
The Indian rope-trick.
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
She went back to South Africa.
Last hand.
How's that football story corning along?
No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.
Where did you get it?
You're my prisoner.
You sold the car. You got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me.
Are you trying to read my palm?
When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep.
Take that back!  Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
Without hope there's no point to anything.
You're entitled to your opinion.
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
Why did you take the money?
I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa.
I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
Near the casino.
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
He doesn't gamble.
What happened?
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
I owe a lot of money.
The point is, they want a man inside.
How much do you owe?
It doesn't seem fair. You're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place.
Yes.
Did you solve your problems?
You've been avoiding me.
I'm Lucy.
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
Where to?
Where do you live, Jack?
So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.
She's my baby.
Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.
That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
I'm off. I need to sleep.
I can't give you a lift back tonight.
You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
You've been recommended by the management here. They know your father. He has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he?
There are three types of casino in the U.K. High volume. Small faction. And MOTR. That's middle of the road. Us.
I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond.
Why four? And not three or five?
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
I just want the job.
Thanks for the information.
I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand.
Where is it? What did you do with it?
It didn't go off.
Fuck that shit.
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
Hey, Doolittle, here's one. An unstable planet. 85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star.
Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
Armed.
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
Everything sounds fine, bomb. Dropping you off in sixty seconds. Good luck.
But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it.
The only thing which exists is myself.
This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb #20. I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?
Hello, bomb, are you with me?
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
It is intuitively obvious.
This is fun.
Exactly.
Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
Yes.
What are you gonna name it?
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
-- automatic channels open --
TALBY!
You know what I think about, Talby?
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix! They glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said.
What's that, sir?
You don't understand, sir, we can't get the bomb to drop.
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is.
Call the skank now or I start redecorating.
Who's Camille?
Nothing happened between me and Tia.
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
Why would I be pissed?
Out there.
What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.
Same old story.  Not interested.
I shouldn't do this.  But I got a client lookin' to score some fire power.  Maybe you'll keep your eyes open for me.
I'll make it worth your while.
You didn't...
Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!
I know.
Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
Thank God.
Who is...
Sorry about your window.
How'd you find me?
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
You miss the good ol' days.  Even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn't have to. And rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat.  Those good ol' days?
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
Am I s'posed to be grateful?
Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--
I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
Gold leaf, art nouveau, French, early nineteen hundreds... I could probably fence this for three or four grand.
I don't know what kind of game you're playing here but I'm out because you are a whack-job.
Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
Your basic hodge-podge.
That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
Well, not me personally.
It turned up on the black market.  One of my sources thought I might be interested.
I think you should go now.
As long as you're okay.
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
Hardware's too sophisticated.  It's gotta be the government.  And why do I think they're looking for you?
I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that?  Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--
Tell me the truth.  Am I a female fog bank?
No.
Yeah.
A long time.
Gotta go.
I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.
Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
Who are you?
Look, you're a player... I'm bringing you this on a plate, and my fee is just the normal cost of doing business.
She's got my word.
Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.
Quitting time.  Grab a cold one?
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
You left out condescending.
A toy?
So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.
I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
For a change.
What about this?
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
Whoa... she is a killer.
I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it.
Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
What are you, high?
Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.
Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
No... You don't think...?
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot.
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.
Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak.
Ahh, sunshine.
Grounded for the rest of the year?
What?!
Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.
Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.
Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!
Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?
Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...
Look, you can have my wallet...
Gimme your gun, boy!
Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
Hi... what's going on here?
Theoretically.
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
I'm not following you.
Did you tell them that I flooded the school?
Dea ex machina...
How can you do that?
Where did you come from?
Why do they call you Frank?
DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night!
Hey...
I mean, the whole sanitation thing. Joseph Lister... 1895. Before antiseptics there was no sanitation, especially in medicine.
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
Where are we going?
So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?
Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
That's alright... I understand.
We're moving through time.
I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?
I know she's here. She never leaves the house.
So, we call them... IMGs.
What? How long was I asleep?
I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
Grandma Death.
You're my only son...
Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?
So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.
I think he saved my life.
So, tell me about your day, Donald.
What is her name?
How does that make you feel?
I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So, does that make me, like, an atheist?
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
Regret.
Then how is time travel possible?
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
I got in. I'm going to Harvard.
Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.
Did you just call me a fuck-ass?
I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.
Kitty, I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days.  Ever since this jet fiasco, I honestly don't know what has gotten into him.
Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.
There's no rule!
Where is she?!
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
You-betcha.
Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
I gotta work with these women.
Amber? Here.
Amber...
Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
...Yah -- 1963. Her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in Louisville, her hometown. Those were different times.
That's it, I'm goin'...
Okay, okay!  Listen-up. Coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal.  Number one, Gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the "Physical Fitness" routine...
If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
Here, I didn't get any.
Hi...
So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know.
Hi.
This here's Loretta.
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here.  Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know...
Well, it's all happenin' so fast. Goodness-gracious, it hardly seems real, y'know? I mean, I won! I'm the winner! I'm going to State!
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
I'm a mirror.
People, people -- wait, wait a minute, here. Uh, while we haven't ruled out sabotage from neighboring state pageants -- Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota...
Do you think that most people would say that teenage beauty pageants are a good idea?
Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire!
Iris, stop!  It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.
What!
This is -- what?
Close up shop. Close up shop, Hank.
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
Excuse me, Father, Mother, when are we moving back to Tokyo? I can't stand this place anymore. They put butter on everything.
King Solomon was game he gave each Girl his name to number them would make a list that long I'll bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong.
That doesn't sound right...  take out "President"...  now read it.
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.
What kind of a dog is he?
That was for you.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
Why wasn't I insulted?
Why didn't his niece slap your face?
Wait a minute.  What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?
Send in the next girl. 
I'm glad I didn't ask you for "Washington Crossing the Delaware".
Now -- how many men you got in your army?
So! -- He's on your side, too.
If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!
Your Excellency, please don't think me silly, but I'd love to have a picture of you.  I want to hang it in my bedroom.
Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?
Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?
I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose.
Once more! 
Then it's war?
Why - er - Mrs. Teasdale - this is an outrage!  This man is impossible... My course is clear...  this means war...  You RUNT!
In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well.  I heartily endorse everything you stand for.
Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
Your Excellency!
Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight...  If the enemy gets those papers  we're lost.  If they don't get them, we're lost.  Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth.  They don't come any better than you...
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
My purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it.
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason...
Mr. Merrick, sugar?
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
You won't be long?
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?
I found it.
Our man is sick. Come right away.
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
What happened?
I want my man back.
Never mind that, I want my man!
Now I think we really do understand one another.
Good morning, Treves.
A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.
Oh yes?
It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.
How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it.
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
...everyone has been very kind.
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
How long has this man been here?
Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?
Have you read it?
It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.
You alright?
I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had.
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
What's this?
Mmmerrick.
I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
Who are they of?
Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time...
The cathedral is coming along nicely.
You did this for me?
My home.
Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening.
Goodnight John. Sleep well.
Won't come out, eh?
Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
Open up! I know you're in there!
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!
WELCOME?
No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams?
I've never LOVED anybody!
The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Halfdan the Black.
No!
Erik. You don't understand.
But you don't realize....
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
The second note.
Erik! You've done what you came to do!
How do we know this is the way?
And will the dead ever return, Freya?
How?
But you don't want to hear it.
Really.
I'll tell you what...
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.
It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
But it IS! Look!
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
About NOT raping you...
Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
I've come to take you back to the land of the living.
Is THAT Odin?
Why should you care?
"But" what?
What are you talking about?
Let's hack her to pieces.
It's not magic! It's just a trick!
We're missing all the fun...
You talking piffle, son?
I want to die...  No, I don't!
What did he say?
You must help us.
You mean we'd be dead?
That's better.
First we're flying -- now we're sinking!
Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.
A magic dishcloth.
Weren't we supposed to?
No! Let go, Snorri!
There is another way.
I think we should go...
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
Look, I bagged it last week.
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
ROW!
She hasn't got any.
I came to find my grandfather.
It can't do you any HARM...
Same thing, isn't it?
You know, my son, our lord said...
Are you all right?
What?
Ooh, that's a good one! You could charge Halfdan fifteen for that one.
My brother blacksmiths!
The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
Are you going to let Erik wake the Gods?
Help!
HOLD it! HOLD it in!
Yeah, you told me that later.
May I help you?
How are you today?
Come over after I'm done here?
You rat.
It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
Oh, Tangerine.
Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!
Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.
I'm sure you would.
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.
It's okay.
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
What do you want to hear?
Well, I should probably get going.
No. I --
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
You should stay.
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
Tomorrow?
How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?
I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody.
A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
You're drunk.
Such a beautiful view.
There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
I'm sure, I said.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.
I think, before.
I knew.
I don't know. What if it breaks?
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
Yeah?
I probably got the same thing as you.
I know. I had to take the day to think.
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
Boo.
See you later, alligator.
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
No way. I can handle this.
And after that?
I really like you, Mary. You know that.
You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.
Oh.
Mary, people come to him voluntarily.
Order me a pastrami for after?
Okay, we're back in.
Do you like quotes, Howard?
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
What, Howard?
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
Mary. What are you doing here?
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
Yeah?
I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell in love with her last night.
She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.
Is everything getting worse?
Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.
That's Jellybean!
No, I guess not.
Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.
I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.
How does she like what in bed?
For magazines?
So now you're bummin' around?
To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?
That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.
Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see,  from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.
Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...
The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.
But Countess...
Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
We have a man down...
You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record?
We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU.
Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee?
I don't know what happened to Justin.
How is he?
Carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations, impaired judgement...
Please...
Please... kill...
What's wrong?
Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?
It's against my better judgement, but I'll run this by the Man downstairs. You'll know my decision by the end of the day.
It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.
Does he know that?
What, Justin, what shows you?
Peters, I want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can't find some answers.
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
Any survivors?
What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
It's 2041...
We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad.
We're a long way from home and we're in a bad place. Let's not make it worse. If anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time.
I told you... She won't let you leave...
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
We have a lock on the Event Horizon's navigation beacon. It's in the upper ionosphere, we're in for some chop.
We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...
...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...
Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.
We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.
Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.
I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.
I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...
Miller...
Go ahead.
It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports...
Miller, come in...
Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!
Weir can't be alive.
Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
Claire...
Here's another one. They're all over the place.
You can't do that.
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
What is it?
What is it?
Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.
What is it?
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
I'm not really dressed for a party.
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
You look like an eighties rock band.
About me? How sweet.
Ben, come in.
I'll be watching over you.
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
Can't do it. I cannot do it.
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
We're working as hard as we can --
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Reed?... Sue?
What's wrong with me?
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Now what is up with that?
Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
You need to control yourself and think before you --
Stop it.
You're really cramping my style here.
Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
Uh, Sue...? I can't.
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge.
Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
I can... make it work.
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
Come on, Ben, come on...
Not until Ben is back inside!
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
Reed's gonna fix me up --
How much did they cost?
I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.
Go ahead. Just make it quick.
I can't do that. But if you wait a minute...
Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
You're not going to tell me, are you?
Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?
Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball.
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
Do you want to take a quick swim?
I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.
What's wrong?
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
There's only one thing we can do. We've got to get rid of it. We've got to get an abortion.
Do you ever look at those girls who work at Swenson's? They're beautiful. And I have to stand out here and watch them six nights a week.
You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
All right... where did you see her?
Did you get her name?
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith.
Mark. What happened to your date?
Hey, Mark. Is that you?
Poor guy.
Jesus. I'm sorry.
You're losing it, Damone.
The Attitude, Damone, is only good until you meet the right girl.
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
Are you Linda Barrett?
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed.
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
You'll always remember your first time.
There... There's his car. I know he's at work tonight. He hasn't come into Swenson's since he called my house. My mother told him I was still at high school, after I told him I was nineteen. I guess I should tell him I'm fifteen.
Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?
I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.
I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
God, he hardly even talks anymore.
You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.
Not coming? What happened?
Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
Mr... Mr. Hand.
Do you want to sit there, Jeff?
Well, you'll find out next year.
Aloha, Mr. Hand!
Where do you feel like going?
What do you do with the jackets people leave here?
You keep them.
What's your other question?
No. That's okay.
This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
John Bonham?
What about the notes?
Really?
Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around...  But I'll give you a call sometime.
Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.
Killed?
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
Cut their goddamn heads off. Every one of them. That's what we're doing in California.
Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.
Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.
God hell! I think I see the pattern! This one sounds like real trouble! You're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over. As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine. And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts...  This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with you -- and we'll have to arm ourselves.
He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me.
Where's the medicine?
That's the press table. Where you have to sign in for our credentials. Shit, let's get it over with. You handle that, and I'll check on the room.
That's good...
Jesus creeping shit!
I have to go.
Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?
What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!
You degenerate pig!
You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!
Never mind, it's absolutely pure.
Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a politician.
Don't take any guff from those swine. Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People.
May I see your license.
In that case, maybe she can help.
Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!
My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?
I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge.
I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here.
We shot a skunk.
I think I know where a CB is.
You got something better?
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
Where's the tunnel?
I'd love to be macho, but this is a pants wetter from all angles.
That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?
We're better off.
Come on!
What now, Geronimo?
Your brother, huh?
Your parents of relation?
We're going to get help.
We gotta be close.
All right!  Tell us about the truck!
My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
You wanna see, baby?
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
In the kitchen, under the sink.
What's it for!?
Open?
Keys.
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
I wouldn't do that, son.
Clever fuckers.
Shit!
Hurry!
COME ON!
HELP MEEE!
Well, maybe they migrate?
Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming, baby! Don't move! Mommy's coming!
We should stick together out there.
Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
Are you lying to me?
Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you out.
And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures.
Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option.
Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. You see, I view myself as the Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and I can't have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can I?
That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.
Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
Good, good. Give them that.
Where's Clifford?
You learn your lines?
There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
Harry!
We're all square now, Harry. Right?
No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.
Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and... 
Francie, you know I can't do that.
Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
But, Kurt, I...
What?
Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?
Just one minute...
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
Well? What'd you think?
How'd I look?
Don't be a rat, Harry.
Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?
What?
Oh no...
Serious, huh?
Is that why you did it?
Don't start, Farmer.
Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.
Hey look, I got some business down in San Diego. Whattaya say you come with me, stay a few days?
Oh my God, I look awful.
I should've known...
I don't think I'd be much good in a war...
I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.
Frances, it's me, Harry?
This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.
Pretty morning.
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here... I am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail.
What happened? Who're you?
What?
And what's the title of this seduc... assault?
Mama...
Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
It's okay.
It's your fan mail, little sister.
Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song.
You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.
Don't... talk crazy.
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
No!
Mama, shut up!
Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway.
I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.
...Did you really say that?
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?
You were with him at the end.
Nice.
I have been... afraid. Afraid... they will hate me... because I am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful
Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
Kill you? Hardly that.
In which part of me did this knowledge reside? In these hands? In this mind? In this heart?  And reading and speaking. Not things learned... so much as things remembered.
She's beautiful.
Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!
Nothing. Still nothing.
He always was opinionated.
Are you sure it can't hurt us?
Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held!
I've loved you all my life
I wish to be your wife.
I've no choice
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
I was just clearing my throat.
The entire school heard it. It wasn't something one could miss.
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
They just caught the man who did it.
They'll hang him all the same.
Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
I have always loved him.
What is your name?
You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.
To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
Preposterous.
It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
It's just this place. The storm. That's why you're all upset.
The killer is still out there.
What'd you see?
You want to leave?
You think you're gonna last all summer?
How come you're leaving?
I didn't know I was asleep... What time is it?
Trouble?
I don't hear it anymore.
It sounded like Brenda.
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
How come?
You said we were special.
Claudette...
Chance to get even?
You just had some lucky shots.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
Ha!
Ow!
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
Anything else you want?
I have six new counsellor up there. They're all babes in the woods in every sense of the word.
What is your purpose in Mexico?
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
You like the car?
Have you forgotten about your sister?
What about Kate?
Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions.
Why did they block the door again?
What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
Not a chance.
My children are not going with you, and that's that.
Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical, ain't it? What am I askin' for, of course it is.  What are their names?
You're a preacher?
Why'd ya quit?
I don't have the slightest idea.
We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico. Now it's time for your part, letting us go.
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.
Who else?
What are you going to do?
You too, preacher?
You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!
It's the bitterest of pills.
There's nothing wrong with this place.
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
What's going on?
Mexico.
What did I say?
Creepy guy.
Yeah.
Yeah, we got a bible.
Are you okay?
I'm really sorry.
Why, just look at all this. You got your kitchen --
We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
What the fuck was that about?
Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say?
Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.
Yes, Seth, I understand.
What does that mean?
You okay?
Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
What dya mean, don't worry about it. Of course I'm gonna worry about it, I can't fuckin' see.
That's what you think?
You could take their head off.
B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door.
The woman I saw you with...
Administration, Ensign Blondell.
Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements generally take some time, Senator.
Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --
Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.
And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
Uh, ma'am.
You were never going to let women serve in combat.  You always had a safety net.  Or thought you did.
I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable.
You'll think about my offer?
Close as I can get, el-tee!
Miller.  Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  Really didn't expect to lose him.
Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where you been the last few years?
The Navy Cross...
By the way, I'll need that option paper by 11-hundred today so I can review it with Admiral Hanover.  And do we have any of that breakfast tea around here?
Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.
So dump on me.
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
I've been trying you for five days. Don't they give you messages?
Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?
C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me.
"In Washington..."
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
At first.
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing special.
What're you guys doing?  Huh?
I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant.
Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured?  Didn't you even think about that?
Managed to activate the ELB.  If you just radio base and let them know, they'll fix on that.  Oh, and make sure they send a helo with a winch -- door's blocked by a reef.  Over.
Got it.
Well, who the shit you think you are?  Comin' in here like that?
I just wonder how that happened.
You don't suppose this is just part of...
You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.
The White House.  If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well, it's been said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man.
I take it this file is still open.
What?
I like that image.
Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Think we can fit up in there?
What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.
I still can't believe it. How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
You'd be surprised.
And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.
What the hell are you doing?
Hey, do you have any glue in your bag?
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
Did you talk with Humphries?
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
You don't understand, I can get us information...
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
Hence the radiation.
Look, I may work for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but accidents and spills are not my field.
Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?
What sample?
The radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue. This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur.
You know, he's not an enemy trying to evade you. He's just an animal.
General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park...  We should be able to take him down.
It's the French Secret Service.
I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that?
Three eggs. I thought there would be more.
I think we should leave now.
What'd they say?
Hello?
Dr. Lazarus... I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but.. I am so very humbled to stand in your presence... I have studied your missions extensively... Though I am Thermian, I have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the Mak'tar.
Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
Sir, it's you  Thank Ipthar!
Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
God, what an ass.
Go ahead!
It's a DAMN ROCK MONSTER!!! It doesn't HAVE motivation!
Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...
He wants to THINK!?
What's happened?
You were holding it upside down weren't you?
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
A boy comes to the door.
We heard it the first time!
WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!
He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he?
Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In "The Quasar Dilemma", the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-
Yes...?
What does the Omega 13 do?
Go. They're off again.
The ship is sustaining structural damage.
Covalent... Right. So...
Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.
How do you remember this stuff?
You Okay, Alex?
Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.
"Crewman #6"... Call me Guy.
Where are the miners?
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
...Okay
They're still behind us...
It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
"Assault on Voltareck III."  Episode... 31 I think.
They're gone.
~e're alive!
A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.
It's Jason...
Clenched jaw...
What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
You gotta admit, they do love him.
You should have let me hit him.
Yes.
Explain -
We.. We lie.
Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...
Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula.  Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death...  Please Captain, you are our last hope.  We have secured a limousine.
How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people.
A model, only as big as this.
... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
Well, it's... This was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  We don't know what it does either.
Do your best, Tommy...
Continue forward, sir?
Find them.
WHAT? WH
I capture Quebec leading an Army by river fordings through Maine... If we don't do it, the British will come down Champlain, take back Ticonderoga and attack us in the spring.
Damn-it!  You've given us a whole new season, Benedict!  And Congress thinks that the British are going to ride right over us come spring. Now half their army is back in Canada.
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
Go on... I want to hear everything.
Is that a fact.
What do you think, George, shall I resign?  It's what they want.
I hope I never have to believe that.
Well, George, who were you?
They're ready.  Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything.  Of course, we get nothing from Congress.  They need boots, coats... we desperately need food.
You, you just need a new flint, General.
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
Me?  You apologizing to me?
You've served me loyally, year after year, without complaining. I've thought hard about you this past winter.  I want to free you, Wil.  I want to give you your freedom, after this battle is fought.
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
Who is that!?
General Washington, is there actually going to be a compromise, I mean, a 'deal' with England?
Are you going to keep him, sir?
What are we going to do?
George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.
Oh, come now...
The British army, sir!
Any word from Canada?
My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold?  He's up there.
Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!
'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?
You must be very rich.
'Charming little victories?' Please don't expect much more of us, Monsieur.
These supplies...?
Like flowers after the snow melts.
Surely you knew this was coming.
"Liberty, Virtue, Country"... That's from Cato... you know, that play about the noble Romans?  As I was riding up to Philadelphia, I found myself thinking about the old days...
Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws.  One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding, it would be legally impossible to distinguish them.
We can't take them.  Are you all right?
A horseshoer?
Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.
I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.
Nathanael, I'm sending you to Virginia to head the southern army, to harass Cornwallis.  Marquis, you must go with him.
Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
We can grow three primary crops in a season and, if we have some luck, we get a forth.  The temperature is generally mild.
Where... do those men come from, George?
And to think I am teaching you to become one of them...
You are a slave owner!  You have been illegally surveying lands beyond the Ohio Valley!  That land belongs to the natives!
And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
My daughter, I ask only...
William, we've been studying hard, I really know my stuff.
What is this?
I reserved a Cadillac.
You see the paper?
Who?
Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
You get the money?
You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.
About sixty.
He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
Says here you're getting Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy.
I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?
There's Ilona.
You know how to write one of these?
That's all there is to it, huh?
I need the money.
In just a second. Two...
You positive about that?
Bo. I'm great. Listen, I'm expecting some people –-
Listen, Harry, how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand? You pay me back at your convenience, no interest.
Assuming I go along with this, when can I have the five hundred?
Hello? You there?
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
Or else what?
Who the fuck are you?
You a quick draw... 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt like that.
That's the idea. I'll think about it.
Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
Have we met? I don't recall.
Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?
That's what I'm doing.
Keep going.
So he comes to L.A...
That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy.
Part of it, yeah.
I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
What does that mean?
These guys, my investors, they run a limo service, came to me originally, put money in a few of my pictures and did okay, they're happy. So they come in on another deal -– this was back a few months ago when I was planning what would be my next picture, about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake. The characters, there's this seven- hundred-pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys, gets them in her trailer –-
Two time academy award nominee, Martin Weir.
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -–
Just a thought.
Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action...  What's he doing? Following a guy?
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
Is he giving you a check or cash?
Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
Well, you had it down cold. Watching you in the movie, if I didn't know better I'd have to believe you were a made guy and not acting. Even the fink part. I never met a fink and I hope to God I never do, but how you did it must be the way finks act.
No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it.
What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed?
At that point, basically, that has to be it.
What's that?
We call you a taxi.
A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years.
You saw that one?
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
That why you came over here, to ask me that?
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
You sure?
You don't act like it?
Hey, Chili.  Get your coat, but don't piss the guy off, okay? It could get complicated and we'd have to call Momo to straighten it out. Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we don't need that.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like?
I miss Murray, Harry.
I'm not sure how I feel about this, Doris.
So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?
I don't have a dog.
What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.
Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
A passenger liner, north island. Over.
Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over.
North Island, please repeat? Over.
Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.
What? You sure?
Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.
I need lag bolts, especially one inch standard. And sheet metal. Preferably steel, about a sixteenth of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll do.
What day is it?
What is your first name?
Maureen.
Ready?
Last thing we want is extra partners.
What other choices have we got?
Light in those passages ain't so good.
It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
How long, then?
Goddamit, Dodge.
It's a hell of a lot of money.
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
Yeah.
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.
You're late.
What's slow?
Morning everybody.
I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.
Coffee?
Take it easy, you'll live longer.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
What, like some kind of ghost?
Something bad happened here, Murphy.
What do we do with him?
What do you think?
Over the gold.
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
I must be in the wrong business.
Call the Coastguard?
Some classy tub in it's day, huh?
So what? We gonna unload the gold and get a move on?
I don't know.
Ho-ly shit.
How're you feeling?
What happened?
He took the shotgun and a light.
Someone from the past.
Yup.
Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending?
Hey, it's nearly nine already - we're gonna have to leave now if we're going to make that movie.
Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...
Seymour! Hello! What are you doing here?
Who is this, Enid?
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
I...
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
So, where's "Weird Al"?
Jesus, look at this guy.
No.
Do you want something to drink?
What do you mean "why"?
Nothing.
When did I say I hated you?
Hi.
Maybe there's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us.
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
"Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
I might actually get the pasta special.
Did you notice all those weird things on the menu? Like "The Salad Explosion"?
So what should we do?
There's my dad with Joanie.
I want to do him!
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
This is way too creepy.
Waiting for the bus that never comes...
I'll bet he never jerks off...
Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick.
Give me all your money, bitch!
That rules!
But those are our people...
...you don't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment.
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
No, really...
Don't you want nice stuff?
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
Why? What did he say?
When was this?
Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it?  That must be it...
I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
There.
What about me? Am I not even here?
Punk rock is over!
Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
There's some good stuff in here... do you like old music?
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
What about her? Would you go out with her?
Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?
C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?
Every guy has a type!
We need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests.
I don't think so...
Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?
It's not hopeless...
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some --
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
Hey, can I borrow this?
I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away.
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
Uh... hello?
Yeah, so I better go -- it's not really the best time to talk...
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...
Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
I hate sports.
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
Well, here's where the fun never stops!
Please Josh?
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
Maybe she's with Josh?
I do need to see Starling.
I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.
You're certain about tomorrow?  But you don't seem excited. 
That's a terrible idea-
Very good indeed.
Finish your tour?
You said "of course" you'd need the donkey. Why "of course"?
I hate to be a bother, John, but the cramp's getting worse.  The pain is actually quite unbearable now.
I didn't have a chance to thank you.
Actually, no.
It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I	suppose...  ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and... 
In my town, when I was little, there was a brute, a bully who terrorized the place.  But he was not the problem. He had a brother who was worse than he. But the brother was not the problem.  One or the other of them was usually in jail. The problem came when they were both free togther. The two became different from either alone.  Alone they were only brutes. Together they became lethal, together they killed.
How many do you think they've killed?
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came.
The workers don't get on?
Did it look like this in your mind?
I am also liaison between these two.
What are they looking at?
Nonsense.
We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night.
He has children?
Janosz?
Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
What do you want with my baby?
Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
You're also a human being, Frank.
No, you didn't, Frank.
Brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it?  There's our old cash machine.  And the dry cleaners we used to go to.  And the old video store.  We really had some good times, didn't we?
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.
Are you all squeaky clean now?
Maybe I should call Janine.
I think he likes you.  I think I do too.
Is this the spot?
I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street.
That's quite a story.
Have you made any plans yet?  You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
You pitiful, miserable creatures!  You dare to challenge the power of darkness?  Don't you realize what you are dealing with?  He's Vigo!  You are like the buzzing of flies to him.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia, the sorrow of Moldavia, command you.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --
I command you.
Keep that up, mister, and I'll find you in contempt.
Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case?
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
Hey!  Wait!  Okay, I'll meet you there.
Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund.  Milt, your new book is called The End of the World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?
It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.
So far so good.
Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
So, no goat hooves, huh?
Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
Who?  Who?  Who?
Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
This is what you do with your spare time?
Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
What's your story, Pete?
Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
And he didn't die of old age either.  He was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
Tell him about the toaster.
And pure --
Now where are you going?
Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?
Oh, Dana, it's you.
Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though.
Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.
You're quite a housekeeper.
What's he doing in my refrigerator.
Do you want this body?
Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
That is one speedy mutt.
Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?
Did you see it?  What was it?
Oh, that's very - unusual.
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
You turned off the power!  Look, there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
Circle?
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
Yes?
Oh!  You're here.
Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
I just realized something.  We've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.
It's working!
I've got to sleep.
You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
I told you it's real.
Anything!  Just make contact.
Why don't I check out the building?  It may have a history of psychic turbulence.
How was your date?
They will.
So do I.
I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.
Boy, that was a rough one.
I couldn't help it!  It just popped in there!
Right.  And the sky would fall ...
For the gods, spit it out!
Where have you been?
Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger.
I am their hero!
Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart felt praise.  Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather.
I back Rome against all her enemies -- if that answer disappoints you, I'm not a politician...
And like children everywhere they scream "freedom" the most when they desire it least.  I beg you, please continue, Caesar.
Throw it down into the streets! Down into the Forum.  If it's my father they want then give him to them!
Gladly, Caesar.  And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.
It's because he comes off as the underdog.
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.
You on your way to trial, too, general?  Or do you think they've already had our trial?
No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day.
I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.
Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing.
Twenty years I've led men to die. For me it was the glory of Rome. But that was something.  If it wasn't that, then it was the pay or the loot of the next whore -- but that was something!  These men here are butchered for laughs!  Their lives are like jokes delivered in the back alley theaters where their death is a punch line!
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!
The Senators admire you.
I made the plume from a quail feather.
You brought the army into Rome.
Well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.
What about their philosophy lessons?
Narcissus!
Who the hell are you?
Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
Death is a very light thing for you.
Take your hands off me animal!
At the end of the day I was approached by the Golden Pompeii Olive Oil company.  Small, but profitable.  They asked if you would endorse their oil.  We could get some very nice posters.  Make some very big money...
You get to come alive again in the country!
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
Then get a large cash advance.
Before they leave, get gold.
So, things change.  The government has moved to the circus.  You're going to fight last.  And Commodus is going to fight first.
Let's talk about this later.  Right now we have other things to settle. You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia.  From there, Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum.  It's beautiful; an old Greek town right on the ocean.  Rich soil.  Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements... although Caesar will give you a sort of pension it's always good to look to the future, keep your hand in the arena... so to speak.
Hello.
You're living at home now. Is that right?
Do you know what you're going to do?
Where we going?
Did they ever find out?
Benjamin -- what's happening?
Why aren't you ready?
Don't cry. 
Is that him over there?
Is it because I'm here?
I don't understand --
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
Please let me go.
The marble?
Are you going home?
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
I just don't think it would work.
Why wouldn't it?
Why do you have to see him?
How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.
Oh no. He said that.
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
Mr. McCleery?
BENJAMIN?
Well here's the purse.
A single room or a double room?
Is anything wrong, sir?
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
What do you drink? Bourbon?
All right then.
Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house.
Please wait till my husband gets home.
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
Did you know that?
I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
What are you so scared of?
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?
He didn't see me.
You don't have to be so nervous, you know.
Did you get us a room?
Do you want me to get it?
Yes?
Yes?
Oh -- yes. Wood?
You what?
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
You can admit that, can't you?
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
Him?
We're talking.
Right.
So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
How many times a year.
Man, is this interesting.
I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
At college.
I'm curious.
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
Drive down the block.
Hello. Get me the police, please.
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
Braddock -- Braddock?
I'm afraid I don't understand.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
I drive around.
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --
When did you two talk this over?
I guess -- about my future.
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
You have yourself a few flings this summer. I bet you're quite a ladies' man.
Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.
Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
Now look -- please --
HUH?
Benjamin -- where are you?
Can you see me now?
Dad -- could we just talk about this for a second?
They came all the way from Tarzana.
I'm having luck for the first time in my life.
It's a short life and a gay one...
You are late -- the dancer's gone to the theatre.
And what are you going to do?
Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
Need any help?
The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
I have an idea working in my head... 
Like dancing?
Reducing?
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Too bad.
We'll dance.
I'd given you up.
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
Going?
You live here?
And then --?
And -- and --
He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
I want to be alone.
Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
There.
So --
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
And now?
Do you understand?
Very early in the morning.
Why?
On the train?
Till then.
And this is Doctor Otternschlag.
Then you know him?
Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least...
The Baron is tired?
If I could get into a game I might win some.
I've no luck.
I take five hundred.
Perhaps you could present me now, Mr. Pimenov.
Oh, let the poor devil alone.
I think it would be much better if you went away.
Is that for me?
Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --
And the child isn't coming?
Telegrams?
Oh, but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful. To live -- to live -- in the Grand Hotel.
Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --
Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.
Barman -- whiskey --  For you, Mr. Kringelein?
I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
You've nothing to fear, Kringelein
If I could trouble the Baron to come and see this beautiful room. I have ordered champagne. Perhaps the Baroness could join us.
You may laugh. Caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me -- they mean a great deal. You see, I'm ill and all of a sudden I got a fear of missing life. I don't want to miss life -- do you understand?
Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.
How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?
Skiing? 
How nice -- your daughters?
I'm going to keep an eye on that Kringelein fellow. I'll find out where he gets the money to hang around the Grand Hotel.
I must go to England -- at once.
Of course -- of course. 
I mean with the Manchester people?
All right.
Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!
I'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.
Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.
Let us cancel the engagement.
Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they were to break --
Good morning, Suzette.
Madam will dress now, it is late.
Madam should sleep.
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.
Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going.
Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in Tremezzo --
Who are you? -- An embezzler most likely.
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
How much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing.
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
We will wait.
'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you.
Pretty as a picture.
One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?
Your what?
No.
Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door.
Your kid's in the back here. He's crying.
I'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night.
Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.
Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing --
Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already...
Come take a look. An entire-suite of main-frame computer.
The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing?
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
Here you are! Two rich people!
Yes, yes, but that's --
I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
I like those.
Not as tough as you, huh?
I tripped over a chair.
What's that?
Well, sure, Roy. You want me to drive up --? Okay, fine, come on down.  It won't be a home-cooked meal, you know.
I just came back from Phoenix.
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead.
Just a few bucks.
At what?
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
What?
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?
Well, uh...
That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...
I can't. I just left home.
That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.
Her job.
Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
Big spender.
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?
Nobody does that single-o.
He retired.
I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
I still don't see why we have to have separate rooms. You expect your father to come through?
You mean, it would be too tough to give me a turndown here. Easier on home grounds.
What I say is, no. We don't do partners.
What's that?
Not many laughs in this room, eh?
No thanks, I'm not thirsty.
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
The killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought-iron poker.
As which point she drops to her knees in pain...
Carter.
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no."
I promise not to run off to Cancun.
You're kidding with that answer, right?
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
Why didn't you tell me?
He found you, didn't he?
I'm not leaving without her.
What?  Where is she?
Yeah, me too, Keri.
Shelve the barf bag.  It's the key to the main gate.
Better?
Molly, of all the people... if I can't trust my resident assistant, then what?
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
Look, they're staring right at us.
I'll pop a Benadryl.
BLAAAAAGGGHHHHH!
Thanks!
Let the party begin.
Is Tim there?
What if your parents come home?
John, they sound Jamie Lloyd this morning! Someone tried to kill her!
God ... this can't be true.
She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from --
My, God!  What have you done to him?
Danny?!  Danny!
Unlike you, Sam, I learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man. Remember what Freud said:  'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.'  Or, in this case, a drink is just a drink.
We need you, Dr. Loomis.
But with Rogers and his house of hacks gone, you'd make the rules.  Just think it over.
There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
Yes?
Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
I suppose.
At least we found the diamonds.
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
I didn't tell you everything.
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
I've been looking at motorcycles.
You ever own a motorcycle?
What's funny about that?
He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.
You told me.
When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
Of course you'll go!  You're going to fly the helicopter.
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
Blue soup.
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
I'm interested in long-term expectations.
You invited me.
Gee whiz--
I wouldn't drop my gun.
How do you know how I'd act in Africa?
The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth.
Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper?
College!
Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting."
I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand.
The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
That's a rifle you have?
Can I help you, sir?
Sir?
This is crazy.
Disease?
This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
Bluh.
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
Harold!
You used to like it stark!
Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.
What then?
You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!
Tell me about its sexual roots.
He cried.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!
He's a child!
That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.
...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
I mean--I can't leave you here. You'll have to go.  I'll tell Mrs. Ryan you were here.  You can come back later.
Safe and sound, I see.  Oh--you came back.
Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.
You've been bitten by bats?
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
We have, have we?
What brought you back?
You're a filthy, rotten bastard.
You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
The new hero is you.
No.
It was a bitch.
And you, Colonel?  Let me guess: You don't know.
You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong?
That goes double for me.
I feel like I want to yell my head off--just yell anything.  Bulllllllllllllll-dickey!
And this is my son, Paul.  He was only four years old when his father disappeared.
Oh, Paul--
Thank you, kind sir.
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
Where will you be?
What's his name?
That's why I'm crying.
I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
I'm touched.
I see.
Gentlemen!  Is this right for a fight?  It's been so long.
What was it?
What's the matter now?
Possibly.
I'm sorry.
It's true.
I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
We made the date three months ago.
What kind of a life is that?
To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace--
That's been said before.
Hi kid.  Would you look what the car dragged in.
Phooey.
Start with the smallest weights. Every week add a pound or two.
Kid--kid--
If he'd just get into scouting, and camp out some, and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire--
We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time.
Well, actually I wanted to ask about this girl. I have her picture here.
What?
No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.
Now, what do you want?
I'd like to place a 'Personals' ad in the Free Press.
Hello. You want some information?
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
Kristen went on that convention today, didn't she?
No.
It's your money. You talk.
You making a feature?
This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.
No.
You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
Say what?
Don't knock it. A girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money. Then you're free. You can go off to Europe, meet somebody, get married. My girlfriend's going to buy her own beauty parlor. Not me. I'm gonna travel. 'Keep movin' that's my motto.  Would you rather work at Copper Penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you? I can make more money suc... doing what I do for five minutes than I can all week at another job.
Why? Are you a sex fiend?
How important do you think sex is?
Yeah, yeah, go on.
I don't blame you, Niki. Really I don't. It's this culture, where everything's based on sex, sold on sex...  ...magazines, music, TV. It's destroying everything. Buy this 'cause of sex, use this 'cause of sex. Kids think it's normal. They think they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes...
Did you find out where she was?
Andy.
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.
You are.
Hello?
I don't know.
Where is she?
The police? They know less than you do.
Yeah. Probably.
Do the police want to arrest me?
You sure as hell haven't been any help.
I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.
Oh yeah? I've done a lot of good stuff. Shorts, features. No major roles it's true. But good stuff.
Oh yeah? I remember that. It was made by some college kids.
Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me.
I hear you got money to spend.  I hear you're interested in... interesting things.
Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
Take it or leave it.
This is from the movie I was talking about.
I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
It's an investment.
You going to Knott's Berry Farm with him?
What's that?
I'm staking out this beer bottle. Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll finish me.
Jake'll take care of me.
Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?
Was he with a girl?
Eh, Poli Sci?
Come again.
Haven't we met before?
No.
Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
Because if you are...
Oh. It looks like a hearse.  Very nice. Compact.
Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
What do you want?
Sorry I'm late.
What do you see?
Do you dance?
Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
Harold?
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
Do you often model for Glaucus?
Me! No. Of course not.
It goes on and on.
You look as if you could.
Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.
The universal language of mankind.  What music do you like, Harold?
We'll come back in the morning.
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
Thank you.
No.
There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars."  Who said that?
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
The ice is melting.
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
I like Glaucus.
Well, I really don't smoke.
Maude, I must speak to you.
But they have.
But they'll put me in jail.
Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate!  Really, sir, I thought that you at least...
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
Why?
I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
I'm going to marry the woman I love.
This is insane.
Do you play?
Oh, is this your father?
And why is that?
And a lot of time.
That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging.  Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do for <u>fun</u>? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?
You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.
They came at me from all sides, hundreds of 'em. We kept firing - Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat! "Throw the grenades," I shouted. "Mac, throw the grenades!" "He's dead," Joe said, and kept right on feeding me bullets.  Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat!  They kept falling, but they kept coming. Bullets whizzing all around me. Zot! Joe falls back with a neat red hole in his head. I thought I was done for. But I kept firing. Zat-Tat-Tat! Only one thought kept me going. Kill! Kill! For Mac, and Joe, and the rest of the guys. Kill! - a blinding flash. I wake up on a stretcher. "Did we hold?" I asked the medic. "Yes, sir," he said, and I slipped into unconsciousness.
That's right.
How about to slit his throat?
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?
Were you also the one who painted the statues?
Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.
Well, well. All my family together again. How very sweet.
It's a beautiful dress...
She's done it.
Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.
Almost complete withdrawal. She hasn't said a word for nearly two years.
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...
What do you mean?
I'm scared.
But I didn't open it! I didn't!
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
Wait!
Nonsense, I...
What the hell are you asking me for? Tag it. Move it.
The past, the future, whatever this object holds.
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
Red. How long was it latched onto you?
harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --
Here. You'll need one of these.
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
It's got a big stone -- in its hand --
I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
Don't look! Turn around.
They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
Got tired of me?
That voice --
She's dead.
We've installed a very handy timer. Set it, walk away. Cable pulls the safety pins, K-boom! Easy to clean, easy to use...
-- should go back. Now!
Myers??? How's your arm?
What took you so long?
Down there. Did you ever loose track of him?
Are you sure about this?
Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
It's freezing, isn't it?
You fucking ass-holes.
Oh.
The box... you opened it. We came.
This isn't for real.
You remember.
You're Julia, right?
Well?
Julia.
Don't look at me.
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
You would be. They tore me apart.
They took my body, but my spirit... they left that here. In the boards, in the walls. Watching the world, but not able to TOUCH it.
It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
No argument.
What have you done?
Is it deep?
You're NOT going to faint.
Maybe a brandy.
I'll be down in a minute
Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?
Who was it?
Are you all right?
What's wrong with you?
Drinking alone.
What are you drinking?
You know it's not often I... you know...
Well, isn't it?
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
No, not much.
What's going on?
Oh Christ.
I'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. Keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually.
Kirsty?
I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
Of course. Every day.
I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
She doesn't even want to leave the house.
It's like she's waiting for something.
Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
I won't be able to stand.
Not that late.
All right.  No. That's nice.
What do we do if there isn't?
Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
Can I lend you a hand?
Steve. Thank God you came.
What's wrong?
Rob.  Rob Gordon.  Circa junior high...
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
Fine by me.  I still want pay to 7 o'clock.
Because it's in The Big Chill.
The little skate-fuckers.
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.
A couple blocks!  About six!
Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean...
Where's Rob?
Sure, but is that it for the list?
Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"
Rob, hi, so sorry I missed your call. In LA on business.  You know how it gets.
Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?
I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight.  I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that.  And he likes you.  It's just that --
Rob --!
I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
What is this.
I'm upset, but I'm fine.
What needs sorting out?
Yeah.
So shall we leave it at that then?
Hi.
Hey!  Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It Up!" That's our song!  Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!
You used to care more about things like Marvin Gaye than you do now. When I first met you, and I made you that tape, you loved it.  You said -- and I quote -- "It was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection."
So you weren't interested in music at all?
So.  Where have you been staying for the last week?
Rob.  Don't be childish.
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
No problem.  If I can ask one question.
You won't like it.
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
Is that why you wanted to see me?
Hello.
I'm sure.
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
Ray.  I hate Ian.
I'm sorry.
What?
Laura...
You know the difference.
Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
More confident, maybe.
Hi.
Nothing.
Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
Barry said its done.
I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk.  I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't.
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
About what?
I'm an idiot.  I should have played the record first.  This place is about to get burned down.
Rob here.
Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?
To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that!
Enough, Liz.
Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...
Are you okay?
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...
Huh?
Would you remember his name?
Taupin, Richard Marshall.  Born March 16, 1945 in Church Hill, Maryland.  Received first driver permit 1967 in Philadelphia.
Who?
Jesus Christ.
What will you do now?
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
No.
You want me to front for you.
No.  So what now?  We just wait?
You're using your son's name.
My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
I carried that rifle in World War I.  This book is a 16th Century policy report for the King of Austria.  The diploma is my con- ference of degree in Latin from Trinity College.  Class of 1672.  It goes on.
Yes.
He is older than I.
Sometimes innocents become involved.
What is it like?  Being you?
Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall.
But we might just give it the 'ole college try.  What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that.
Come on Brenna, your ass is already in a sling, don't drag me into it.
Good way to lose your job.
Who is it?
Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two.
Aye.
Hmm, que rico.  What is it you call this?
Three days you've laid there. It's time you ate.
The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
You're no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez.  We're raised as riders.
What is the fascinatioon?  It is only a leaf.
This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more.
I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.
My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands.
If you send me away now, Mara, I'll not come looking for you.
I thought I gave orders the regiment was to drill.
Equals?
Wait.  I think we understand each other.
Don't threaten me, Private.
You see Major?  You are not so different...
Yeah.
Any other I.D.s come up?
Are you sure?
Smith.  Carl Smith.
The last four.
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
Friend of yours?
Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.
I want you to come to me.
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way.  He'd also been in the country less than a week.  What is your citizenship?
Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now.
Who is it?
I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.
All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
What's the matter?
Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.
Did you give her the money?
You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
Well, so you're getting married tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?
I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.
I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.
And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here...
Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
If you've any accusations to make, Hartman, make them in the proper manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask you to get out.
No? Well --  Johnson, you're under arrest.  You, too, Burns.
What do you want?
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
You can break it, can't you?
Sure you can. Come on.
What do you mean by that?
Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --
Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to.  How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day.
I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through.
Bermuda.
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
Then what does he want with you?
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.
Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.
Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
What now?
Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!
No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.
Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!
Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!
Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?
For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're waiting for the rest of that story!
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
Double-crossing swine!
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.
If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything.  Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here?
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
Don't open that!
No!
Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
Where'd you wire him?
Sure.
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
What!
Anything you want, Boss.
Sure, boss.
Walter!
He's on my phone. He just called me.
So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me.
Who locked the door?
Hey!
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.
She says she's gonna write fiction.
You guys wanna play some more poker?
Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story.
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
Goodbye, Yonson.
No -- just coffee, Gus.
Same way you did.  Through that gate.
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight.
I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
Where is he?
That gives you an idea of what I'm up against!
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
Pure politics!
Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
Shoot to kill, I said.
A sight for sore eyes!
You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!
You can let him out on bail, can't you?
Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.
Who is it?
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
Hiding him where?
Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?
Don't talk too loud.
Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.
Pinkus.
Well, well -- Miss Mollie Malloy.
Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered --
Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding.  Come in, Dave Schwartz.
The door was locked.
It's true.
Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?
I never was.
Well go on then. You can't join if you can't answer.
That word is special. That word is only for something really important. Now, repeat after me... Bugger off.
Sod.
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.
Well, I'm not having any. Even if it's not poisoned. I don't think it's right. It's not patriotic.
Now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. Got it? Like this.
Who pays for them?
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
What did we know? We were seventeen.
Why not?
You always were, Clive. Steady the Buffs.
We all had to write a last letter home.
You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.
You know it? It must be an old one.
And where do you think you're going?
I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.
Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.
He could always make me laugh.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
To Mary McDonald, Thelma Richardson, Bobo Hinds, Lily Sanderson...  ...Little Sarah Whats-it, now there was a spirit. And Marjorie Anderson.
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
Tiny's home.
Come on, ma... this bitch's got it coming.
Who's your Daddy!
So, you live here alone... I mean with just your brother?
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.
Hey, great they're back.
He walks, duh.
Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes.
Keep the change and get yourself a new name.
What's this?
How long have you been running this place?
The Duke?
You mean John Wayne?
She's pretty cute.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
She looks like she stinks.
That reminds me of a film I saw once of a guy who got out of his car at Lion Country Safari to take a picture of a lion cub and got eaten by the lions.
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
Almost there.
Fuck! We are fucked!
What's he so excited about?
Should we stop?
Go around him.
Check this out.
How much is a person supposed to stand?
Officers, officers what can I do for you today? I ain't fried up the birds yet... if that's what you're ring a ding dinging about.
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
I always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
How long is that gonna take?
You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't hear so much.
Hey, maybe she knows where this is?
Fuck, it's freezing.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah?
Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.
Thank you.
That was good babe, just keep doing that.
Someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!
Hello...  ...hey Denise... what, what's wrong, did you break down?
Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place.
Rise and shine.
Don't even say it.
How long has it been?
I still don't.
What'd we here, Georgie?
What'd ya got there?
Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
Oh, right.
So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?
I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.
We hit the jackpot! Let's roll, good buddy. We got ourselves a convoy.
I'll go. It's my fault.
I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
I suggest you kids leave now.
Why? Why are you doing this?
Where is he?
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.
Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming from?
Fuck, go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down.
Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
Don't worry, we'll find her.
Over.
Tell him, Harold.
Lila, what are you doing in there? I need to get ready for my date.
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
Good morning...  We need a name for him, don't we?
Oh, Hi, Gabrielle.
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
Shall we close up, then?
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
Gabby, what is it?
Fine.
Please. Just one minute of your time.
Well, I think...
I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
My apologies, madam.
You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you.
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt.
Loves animals. Loves you.
My brother is discreet.
Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor.
Oh?
Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.
Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read.
No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment.
Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm.
You do?
Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.
What are you doing in there?
It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds!
Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?
What SPF, sweetie?
Flares?
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
It's perfect!
Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous.
What are you doing in there?
Who is it?
Who is it?
Who from work?
Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know.
Do you like my new look?
That's great. It's a great color for you.
Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in...
How's work?
Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!
Bravo to you, Puff!
I think he's ready.
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.
Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.
Did I? I tried so hard! I really concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy!
Interesting.
Unn.
Puff, put the gun down.
Mother?
It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I'm an ape like dad was...  And I have to go back into the woods now... forever.
Yes.
Boys just passing through?
Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady.
Give me a bottle of beer.
Oh, wait a minute, Miss Packard.
All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
Will you take a check, Bert?
Stay with this kid. He's a loser.
I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?
Character.
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.
Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way.
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
Thinking about what?
Here, I got it.
Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart.
Fine.
Well, we won't.
Sure.
Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
I can beat him.
They're fine.
Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
He's my partner.
Just tell me where I can find him, friend.
It's quiet.
What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."
You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
And I you.  I think I've heard about you, Mr. Felson. You play pocket billiards, don't you?
When?
How much you playin' for?
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
It's the lights. And the scotch.
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
Do you always ask so many questions?
You talk kind of funny, but I like it.
Yeah? What do you do now?
I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
A day like any other. People come, people go.
Where you been all day?
You were asleep when I left. I didn't want to wake you. Did you go out?
Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
You got it all in your head?
Don't you ever cook anything?
No, why should I? It's yours.
What happened?
You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?
Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.
He knows. A lot.
You know, someday, Sarah, you're gonna settle down. You're gonna marry a college professor, and you're gonna write a great book. Maybe about me, huh? Fast Eddie Felson, hustler.
You need the words?
You glad?
What do you want to tell me?
Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
Go on back to the hotel.
Very good shot.
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
You name it.
Let's make it three thousand dollars a game, Fats. C'mon, three thousand dollars. That's my bankroll, my life's savings.  What's the matter, Fats? All you gotta do is beat me the first game and I'm on my way back to Oakland.
Do you remember where you lived?
What choice did I have -- ?!
Will you keep feeding me?  How long can you live like that?  Until it kills you?  Until I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back.
I don't know.
That's who you are too, Emma.
You want me to stay?
Shhh... don't talk.
Good evening.  Did you have a pleasant day today?
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
Need some gas?
Only got one kind.
Hell of a night.
Bathroom?
Wow.  There's the town.  And there's the air base.  This is a great hill.
Why, Dad?
There are more this year than last.
Which one's that?  The dull, red one.
Well, son?  Should we call it a night?  I for one have had a long day.
I had an awful dream.
It's probably the solenoid.  Take it back to Gleason's, they said they'd fix it if we found anything wrong.
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
Children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
How did it get Mrs. McKeltch?
Why?
Where, Jimmy?
Did you call the State Police?
No one comes here after dark.
You're looking for life?
What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?
Your father asked you a question.
I have school.
You're being paranoid.
Better be. You left me for him.
Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?
Are you all right?
Moishe Martinsburg, Mr. President.
He still gets air sick, huh? In all of this I didn't get the chance to thank you two.
We're losing them.
What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?
I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
Spunky?
This I can see.
What're you doing?
With your permission, Mr. President, I'd like to remain my your side.
General Grey, co-ordinate with Atlantic Command. Tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can.
Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?
Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.
We've been collecting planes from all over but...
More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.
This is ridiculous.
With their shields down it might be possible.
He's trying to impress you.
You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
You're late.
I shouldn't have left her.
He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?
But I gave you some this morning.
I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives.
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
May we go home now, please?
Marcus!  I did it!
Venice, Italy!
It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
The Word of God...
Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century, I should think.
Where did this come from?
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."
This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two "markers" that had been left behind would.  This Tablet is one of those "markers." It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed out -- it's incomplete.  Now, the second "marker" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy.  As you can now see, Doctor Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. We're only one step away.
Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?
Doctor Jones?
It would make me very happy.
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
No. You like the way I do things.
How did you get here?
You came back for the book? Why?
All I have to do is squeeze.
Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you.
It's important!
Oh, it breaks the heart.
No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.
Through the library?
Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
No! Don't Shoot!
She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi?
The floor's on fire! See?!
Come on, Dad. Come on!
Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.
Well... I can't think of anything.
Dad?!
The penitent man is humble before God.
Elsa never really believed in the Grail. She thought she'd found a prize.
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
Get that camel out of the way!
Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
Where's my father?
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
Who are you?
Dr. Jones, you know very well that the Thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century.
We'd appreciate it if the Maharajah would let us stay tonight. We'll be on out way in the morning.
I had a question, Mr. Prime Minister. I was examining some of the Maharajah's artifacts.
Indy?
Indy, look!
What you look at, Indy?
Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up and keep eye on things...
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
Give me the stones!
Look out, damn it, I need that antidote!
Listen, we just met for crissake! I'm not that kind of girl!
What're we going to do?! Where're we going?!
So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
I'm freezing. What do you mean, tag along? From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me.
What'd he say?
Took what?
And then they took their children.
Don't let it pull you deeper!
Can you move your arm?
Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
What about the future?
I'd like to find one of those myself.
The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago.
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
Any more complaints?
Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?
Primitive sexual practices?
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
Get -- the -- bug -- off!
Oh no -- oh no!!
What?!
Oh my God! He ripped out his -- he killed him!
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
What?
I can't!
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.
My name is AL.
You're in my head...
No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play...  What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
Somebody's been here.
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
Quit screwing around, this is important.
You've heard of the PEM114...
Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
What are you doing?
What was that?
What's that?
Now what?
Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer.
Thanks.
They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
Now what.
Just walk down the hall?
Corridor A.
I'm back.
What is it?
What do we do?
You mean...just leave.
What about money?
I don't have any.
It's just not enough.
I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
Holy shit!
Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
I don't want to eat it.
What is it?
.
Wait.
Where is she staying?
Where are you going?
Now, where would I be?
What is it?
They both look good to me.
Get close to them.
Which one?
Joe, be careful!
They're all in it.
Voice stress analyzer.
Maybe she's telling the truth.
You got any books in there?
And on my time.
Don't you think I stand out like this.
What do I do?
Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
I can't...
Left...The one with the red dot.
Then, why'd he lead us here.
Do it.
Are you alright?
You're a lucky man.
What are you doing?
JOE       Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
JOE What abilities...?
No!
They have stolen state property.
You've cut your hair?
How about a deal?
Must be delayed effects of the drug... I'll get him out of here.
What Job?
Bit expensive, sir.
What are you doing here, where've you been?
It is to me too.
...Foreign service.
Your memory.
Don't you want to get out?
Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
Don't do it!
How's that Trucklhouser Beer?
What did you say?
What?
Oh...and who is it!?
...Blake
Wait. What's your name?
You again.
I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
Joe! What happened to you?
You work for Ryuji?
This business is over.
Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
We're very close.
Now what?
Where what?
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
Why not?
What a mess.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
How?
Just like that?
You son of a bitch! You conned me!
He can't help us.
He wants to apologise.
Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...
Is there anything else?
You can't take that.
Yes.
The other working.
Yeah? What for?
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
Yeah.
Shit...
I can't get out of here til mid- morning. I'll be in tomorrow night...  Listen, could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi...
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
And what are you implying?
A gun? Yes.
That bullet was for a .38 caliber. Do you own a .38?
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
You can't take that... It's personal property...!
Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
What does that mean? "Rife with -- ?"
Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
Hi, baby.
I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?
...taping?  What are you taping?
Thank you, Bob.
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?
"I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'" You know, you take the "60 Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand's right. Maybe I'm hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? "60 Minutes"? What the hell for? Infotainment. It's so fucking useless, all of it.
Area code 212-555-0199.
...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not?
Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?
We're there.
...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...
Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
Oh, man.
It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
Lowell!
I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
How have you liked your stay?
Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American media?
Look, I really don't have that much time...
Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement?
Seven dwarfs?
I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.
The new place? New.
No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow. So, what about?
Hello. You there
The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus?
Next to your father?
Liane, this is a preliminary...  You didn't tell her we were taping? What did she think she was coming to New York for?
I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...
B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block...  But you, I mean, I know how...
That's not the point.
You greased the rails!
"Up to you, Jeffrey. That's the power you have, Jeffrey. Vital insider information the American public need to know." Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around.
I think I need to call the police. He won't respond...
What about now?
Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
"I would bet on it."
"You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?"
Object to the form!
And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind. Most people consider what they're saying... social skills... Jeffrey just charges right ahead.  Now, I know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown & Williamson, Jeff...
Honey, I don't think this is really relevant to...
As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.
-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.
Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
I don't need it.
It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
Who was that?
Mrs. Guttman, you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirty-six years, ever since you were married --
What is your husband's profession?
So who'd you hire?
You said 'yes' didn't you?
I assume this is on Rex?
What is it you're after, Miles?
He'll regret this.
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --
A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
And here I thought my mother was...
I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
I want to be your -- your wife.
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
No.
No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin, if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit from the marriage.
I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll move to the...
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
I don't believe you have "things."
Comfy!
I want to nail you ass.
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
STUFF.  Got a light?
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
Wait! He works for YOU?
Hello Marylin.
You wounded me first, Marylin.
We are. And it's winding down.
Are you alright? You lost weight.
I'm sorry. Where were we?
I was devastated. Of course.
Forgery and Fraud?
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
Miles Massey.
Every week --
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
Ha Ha.
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
...arty farty!
He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick --
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.
Oh—Mary—
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in—
All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.
Here you are.  Do you mind if I ask you something frankly?  Do you love my daughter?
What's this about not eating?
You only met him once .
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
Please don't shout.
What's the matter, Ellie? What's wrong?
Ridiculous!
Are you going to see him?
If you really mean it, I will.
Been sending her meals in regularly?
I haven't changed my mind, Westley, I want you to understand that! I don't like you! I never have!  I never will! That's clear enough, isn't it?
You talk as if—
Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much.  We shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New York—and if we didn't go, she might lose it.
Me? Forget it, son.  I got millions.
Oh, yeah?
I beg your pardon!
Why, no—I—  Yes . . . I guess I will.
Chalk up one for your side. Now listen, you want to get to King Westley, don't you?  All right, I'm here to help you. What I want is your story, exclusive. A day-to- day account. All about your mad flight to happiness. I need that story. Just between you and me I've got to have it.
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
You'll find the showers—and things—right back of the second cottage. 
Where is the shower?
Must be the Spring.
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged. 
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Yeah. I got a letter from Aunt Betty. She says if we don't stop over at Wilkes-Barre she'll never forgive us.
Oh, so now I was drunk!
Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
Yeah.
This looks like the best spot.
All right. You win. Let's forget it.
Sure.
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
Uh-huh. Want one?
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
Number two is a wider movement—a smile goes with that one—like this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
Here comes a car!
What're you going to do?
What'd you give him for the car?
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
You're forgetting you're married.
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
No harm in your coming to see us.
In about fifteen minutes.
Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
Here's another wire from Peter Warne.
A thousand dollars!  Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
I'd put you there myself.
You!
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
Listen, man—I'll tell you what I'll do. When I come back in the morning, I'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit? What do you say?
What?
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
Take that story there, for instance. Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.
Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.
Sh-sh-sh—! Soft pedal, you mug!—before I— What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thing—and you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
Yeah ?—How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
Oh, thanks, thanks, Mister. I always knew you guys were kind-hearted.
Boss, Oswald impersonators?  Sounds like James Bond now.
The U.S. Attorney in Washington "declines" to serve our subpoena on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA Director Richard Helms, or any FBI agent we named.
Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?  I said Oswald must've flipped.  Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?
Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald kid would pull off a stunt like an assassination?  Just goes to show, you can never know about some people.  Am I right, Jack?  Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't tell me we have another bleeding heart here.  Hell, all these years I thought you were on my side.
Who the hell opened my files!  You've been looking through my private files, haven't you, you weasel?
Or a cover up!  Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?
I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill, even if you're family.  He's a big shot businessman.  I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by another name down here.
Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking tour?
Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
He had his palm print on the weapon.
Those bastards!  That's proof enough right there of what we're up against. The whole goddamn Federal Government, Bill!
I don't buy it, chief - why would the FBI cover it up?  You're talking the whole FBI here.  A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country?
What's it look like, Nick?
Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.
...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?
No, I never saw him before in my life.
I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
What about Ruby?
Then who killed the President?
They'll get to you, too - they'll destroy you... They're untouchable, man...  I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see straight.
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
I don't remember his name.  You must understand it was quite crowded, and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the President who is dead, you don't look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are.
I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.
Daddy!  Where have you been?
These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.
Four to six.
Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
After dinner you paid him to have sex with you.
Who?
Let me show you his picture. 
It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you think I would be here today... talking to somebody like you?
In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that...
But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
I cannot believe this.  It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...
No.  I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.
Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?
Did they live?
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
Of course, I've changed!  My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  And now King.  Don't you think this has something to do with that?  Can't you see?
Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey."  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not "fine" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.
They killed him, honey.
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
Anything else unusual about him you'd be able to describe in a court of law, Willie?
One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do.
They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go.  No record of them ever being questioned.
Goddamn Sam!
Who do you think changed the parade route?
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
Head of the CIA since '53.  Kennedy fired them both.  Cabell was his deputy for nine years.  Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop.  Now we'll have to subpoena them, Lou.
I just plain don't trust him anymore.
There have been a number of reports in reputable news media - Time, Newsweek, our own NBC - that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury.  What is your response?
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
It never did. 
Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?
How much more?
You have other information?
Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say. 
What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.
I don't think so, Al.  You remember the Hemingway story, "The Old Man and the Sea"?  The old fisherman manages to catch this great fish - a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back in.  But by the time he reached shore, the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton.
I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
Where were you?  Europe, Pacific?
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
That's all you've had all this time?
Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
Can I make a statement?  If you request me to go back to Washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that?  Can you take me with you?
Can I help you?
I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem.  Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?
Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just -- you know -- smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.
What?
That requires me goin' out tonight?
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --
Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you?
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
This is your money?
Help yourself.
But now you're telling us now you do.
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.
I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
I'd love one, but not there.
You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.
He's the one who wants you.
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
Yeah, if I cooperate.
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
Thanks, but I have my own now.
Who is this?
It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.
It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.
How do you feel about getting old?
Fifteen thousand.
I walked right past you.
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
What're you, a bag lady?
You talk them into it?
Will Ordell go for that?
He was here?
You think he's got a thing for you?
I see.
You're avoiding the question.
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
You do that?
And is that it?
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
What if he checks it?
In a dress.
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
That's Ordell's.
Oh, Miss Brown?
Look, that shit ain't mine.
Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
We could, if I'm not in jail.
Yes. All those things are true.
Where's the bag she gave you?
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
I'm waiting for the phone.
He killed a guy who works for him the other day.
Jackie?
Well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?
I'magine they asked who you givin' it to, too.
Yeah?
Yeah?
How the fuck they know that?
You told them that?
No, I give it to someone else first.
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
Who?
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
No, you gonna give her a Robinson's/May bag this time?
You okay?
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
Where were you?
I lived there for about nine months.
About five years ago.
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
Is it dead?
That's not what I'm saying at all.  You know where he went?
He went to meet that stewardess.
Is it this aisle or the next one over?
Thanks, Baby.
I got me five M-60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece.
I'm going to wait in the car.
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
I know you don't know. I said guess.
Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.
Who was that?
What did he do?
I didn't look like a bum.
What's your relationship?
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
So you're sure she's dead.
You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?
Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
You know who I saw in the dress department?
They don't have your winning personality.
How can I help you?
Who's it for? A relative?
What's his full name?
Beaumont Livingston.
They do consider this a violation of his probation. Your boy's looking at ten years, plus the concealed weapon.
House or apartment?
I can see that. Why?
You didn't hear?
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck -- but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind.
You still there?
I'm alone.
How the fuck did he find me?
She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it.  I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'?
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
He ain't here right now.
Hiya Jake. That was some dance.
You want to see me? Well, here I am.
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
Something weird is going on here. What is it about us? Even in Nam it was always weird. Are we all crazy or something?
Daddy. Let go.
You know, you got a strange line here.
Hello.
Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you?  What's going on? How can you just turn away?  What about the others?
Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know?
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
Daddy, what was that noise?
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam.
You think they're connected?
It's not worth goin' over again and again. Whatever happened, happened. It's over.
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind word about me in years!
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
Perfect. We got it.  Okay. Let's just give it a little try. See if you can stand.
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
Are you in the service?
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
I know very little about demons, Ja- cob, fleshy ones anyway. I know them as literary figures, biblical ones ... Dante, Milton ... but Jacob,  this is the 20th Century. We don't see demons now.
Christ, I know how it sounds.
Not according to my charts. Do you have an appointment?
If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?
What was that?
What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
She was good in bed, though.
The room!
Where'd you leave 'em?
Yeah, but for what?
Look at these, will ya? I don't believe it. Jesus, these are fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ... And here's my brother, when we were down in Florida.
Is that the one who died?
Ready?
I'm going home.
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
Oh, come on. It's early.
We're at Della's.
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
Don't gimme that.
Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind.  Love me a little?
I know.
Who else were you expecting?
How?
Where are they?
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
What's wrong, Jake?  Forget to take your antidote?
That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
What'd you do that for? It's an in- teresting story. All these people are still disappearing. Right off the street.  Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right?
Jake, what is it?
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
Oh?  Where you going?
Where's West? New Jersey?
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
Where have they gone?
This isn't happening.
Oh God!
Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know me. I've been tracking you for a long time. I just wish I'd spoken to you before tonight.
I always suspected the effects might come back. That's why I had to follow you. I had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.
The truth can kill, my friend. Five hundred men died out there. This isn't a story they'd ever want out. When Paul's car blew up I realized the scope of the thing. I knew they meant business.
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
I would have stayed there if I could.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Please come quietly.
Dream on!
He's burning up.
Hello.
You're lucky. How many vets you know are even employed?
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
Let's get a couple drinks, okay?  Hey, take a look behind us. Do you think that car is followin' us?
It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
Don't do anything.  Paul, I know what you're talking about.
Everywhere, like a plague.
I don't know. I don't know.
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
Do you want me to get someone?
Is he all right?
That's nine to four, geek-boy.
It's locked!
What's that?
When the left hull goes, so will the right.
Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.
Bomb?
Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
Creepy.
Nice touch.
Shit!
I'll need system four converters.
Hey! I'm not ready.
As long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance.
Where is...?
Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs.
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.
I need to know what you know about this guy.
Give me a break! What happened?
Rizzo, he's out there.
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!
We're screwed!
What if you miss?
Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going.
Well?
Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
Yuck.
I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?
Okay?!!
Push off toward us.
Now this is getting exciting.
I'm missing two!
YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.
You're quicker than usual.
What are you doing?
No.
I'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod. Damn.
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
Sorry, sorry.
Kay-em you okay?
Yo, Teach, what the fuck?
How do you know?
Something's wrong.
Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a few questions.
So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
Yes!
Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
Son! -- Out of the water now!
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
Did you bring a check?
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
And incidental damages, if any...
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there?
What's the point with hooks and Lines? --
How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!
He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?!
He's trying to sink us!
Right.
Sexy, hm? What was I before?
Be careful.
Mikey loves his birthday present.
Home... New York?
Martin!  Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority?
Only 24 hours!
Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.
I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead.
Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?
...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining.  -- did you notify the coast guard?
Well, if one man can catch a fish in 50 days, then I guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day -- beginner's luck.
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported?
Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?
...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence.
What? What?!
How can you tell?
Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat?
You all right?
What's that, a ship?
What the hell?
What day is this?
Think the tide's with us?
And nobody else saw her in the water?
You here for the summer?
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering.
I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...
You wanna call it a night after here?
Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one.
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
What have you got there, Lenny?
I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs --
I don't need to pass basic seamanship.
Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh?
Easy! It'll tear right out!
Coming right to us!
Follow him!
What can that gun of yours do?
I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state.
Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it?
Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids.
So, it looks like you're getting pregnant-er these days.
I don't like Katrina.
We're getting a stretch limo.
You're being really immature.
That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
What, you mean as friends?
Mine too.
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
Just like our moms and teachers!
What? I'm not made of stone.
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
Cool it.
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
We don't even have a dog!
Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.
What is that, Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck?
Your guitar is named Kimber?
Why aren't you at work?
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child.
I know what junk is.
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
Uh, thanks.
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
I'm dying to see what you've got to teach me.
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
Uh, hi Su-Chin.
Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking.
Then what's going on?
Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.
No...
Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it?
What?
Okay, this is no laughing matter.
Did you say you were thinking about adoption?
Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds.
She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts.
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
Please stop now.
What?!
Or...
So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle? Minus or plus?
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
The Penny Saver sucks.
You're not listening to me.
Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.
How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters?
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
God, why is everyone always staring at me?
So. What's that thing?
You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
What would be a good time for you?
Have you found a place to stay?
A hotel?
...Pardon?
Is it hard to learn?
You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking.
...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man.
Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper.
Early, what're you doin'?
Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
...Mind if I hold that Bible?
You think I'm goin' to kill you. Well that'd make me a liar then wouldn't it?
Tight fit.
Brian.
You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri?
So tell me... what happened here?
You two been busy in here.
Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger.
We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes...
...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.
All set?
I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
Carrie... stop it.
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
Carrie, watch for Early.
You be at this personnel office, Friday, three o'clock sharp.
Could be.
How old you?
With how many people?
Well, girl. You tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections.
Shit.
She can fuck?
Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little.
And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby.
Shit.
I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
Did she suck your dick?
Why?
It is right.
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
You know like in "The Wonder Twins" they share everything.
I wanna fuck Darcy.
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
Yeah. Why you give money.
That's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.
So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
Shut up.
Where you at?
Yo, you think we killed that guy?
I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
I just know. I know you'll love it.
Who are they?
You know what I want to do?
Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
Telly says was up.
You still mad at him?
You didn't?
Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know.
Yeah. Have you seen Telly around?
Yeah. And sex is just like, yeah let's have sex.
You know... You know a lot of times sex gets in the way. Has that ever happened to you?
You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.
Yep.
Hi mom.
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something.
We seem to have a little problem here?
Casual.
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
Are you crazy?
What in the hell do you think you're doing?  Slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace.
We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor.
He's not talking about himself.
We're interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there.
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.
Don't fuck with us!  Where did you go!
It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
Hello, Peter.
But you said you didn't know her.
I'm just trying to play the game.
I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.
Huxley's quote also says, "his play is always fair and just."
Have you any idea what the message is?
What makes you think I was there?
No problem.  We're in.
D2-d4...  b1-c3... and c1-f4.  It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening.  David, can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years.
What scars?
I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
They asked who would be best suited for this and you--
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
Why did he?
Come here.
Okay.  Nice meeting you.
What are you doing up?
What is it, dad?
It isn't Kathy.
What about prints?
Well?
You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
Kathy?
That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.
Yes.  Why disguise your voice if no one knows it?
I don't think it matters.  Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.
His home would be... Mount Olympus.
As large as castles.
And what if he's wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him.  If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.
If you can think of anything else give us a call.
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think it's just a tease.
You're always in the middle of a match.
About what?
Feel like practicing?
Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?
That's a very personal question.
Do you always open quickly?
They couldn't break the riddle.
Take your average cop.  They deal with death everyday.  If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.
I'm not playing a game now.
I just don't want to fight with you.
You can turn everything around so easily.  This is not just another game, is it?
Did you call?
Why?
If we could just figure out what the next word is going to be.  He said the game's going to end tonight so there's only going to be one more word.
You beat him.
No, I want you to do good.  That way when I beat you at the end I'll look that much better.
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
Me too.
Mine was worse: I dreamt you picked your nose in public.
Where is the Fortress?
They have Lyssa!
This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.
I am too old to climb down a rope.
No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us.
You choose these?
She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.
No. We will find another way to locate the Fortress.
From here, I must go alone.
She must make a glaive.
Slayers!
Do not let the waters touch you.
It is today?
I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her.
Help! Help! I'm drowning!
Once is enough, thank you.
Fame is what you leave to your sons.
I'm not hungry.
Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.
Go. I command you.
We must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise.
A good thrust, my friend. Another second and there'd have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories.
What is that awful looking place?
Quell?
You do?
What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
He is the King.
I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
You know the voice.
Each to his fate, lad.
Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
I was beautiful then.
She was not as beautiful.
You had a son.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
You see?
Give me his name, I will mail him.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
...Good...  But what's special in him?
...You moved too, didn't you?
At a certain moment I thought: maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?
No, no.
Take...
Here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. There, you fix client's distance... How much to the bench down there in the park?
130... 140...
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.
May I go to the cinema?
...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.
If you knew, Leon...!  I killed one thousand in my head...  And this never disturbed my sleep.
Stop. Everyone is looking.
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
...Shit!!  We'd found him. We waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
Mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, I make you notice.
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
What do you do, with the money you earn?
You say it just to calm me!
Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.
Don't fear.
I'm sick with practicing, that's it...
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
Is he still alive?
I think I will get back in Messina this summer... It's too long I haven't been there.
Salute.
You'd better talk good, son, because, for the moment, I've got a quite bad opinion about you.  Norman smiles.
Do you recognize him?
Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?
Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me.  Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --
She was being symbolic.  What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
Nothing's going to happen.
Are you a preacher?
This is Indiana -- nothing's going to happen to you.
I've seen it before.
Yes?
You thought I sent them?
Have I forgotten something?  Is this a special day?
The new store?
Is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
I want children.
If I die, you'll know where to look for me?
From where?
Why?
You don't have to prove anything to her.
Red flag, man.
You know what... I'm just little now, but I'll be big soon.
I thought you were asleep.
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
Each inch represents 150 miles...
What are you saying?  This story is too big for this paper?
Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her.
I'm really lost.  What does this have to do with walking?
I need to show her how much I love her Kris.
Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.
Adelle told me, your writing is going well.  The Crusader for social issues and all.
Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?
Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help.  But I'm not risking your life.
You're in pain.
You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back.
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
Orange soda?
Water?
I'm sort of curious... if you're willing to pay me two-fifty... not that I mind... I mean, I'm OK with that -- why aren't you staying in a hotel?
Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.
Mind if I use the bathroom?
Do you want to fuck now?
This is the home of an angel.
You OK?
Yes.
First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?
Sera you are crazy.
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
Ben?
Giving you money makes me want to come.
I am planning to go out and do some work.
I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
Please!
I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
Hey, Brad... how's it going?
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
It is, after all, Sera, my money.
Where have you been?
A full night on the street and this is all?
Don't hit me.
Yes? What?
Have you told anyone that I'm here?
What alibi?
You understand you're on trial for murder?
I loved him!
Is he always such an ass?
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
I'm not having an affair with Enrique -- you know a Delta Gamma would never sleep with a man who wears a thong! I just liked watching him bend over to clean the filter --
What's going on?
I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?
Did you get it?
I'm sorry, but --
I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
Was she carrying a weapon?
So she was distraught that her husband was dead?
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
Yes?
You can't even imagine.
I didn't even get to go to his birthday party.
How'd it go at the trial?
You can't go home!
It's not my alibi to tell --
Warner can't even do his own laundry.
You're pawning The Rock?!
Too demure?
Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week.
Here. You're gonna need this.
Elle, do you know what happened on "Days of Our Lives" yesterday?
Picking out my wedding dress!
Speaking of which, can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K- Mart.
Don't ask.
Aside from that.
You really think I'm attractive?
So now you're -- ?
Someone missed you.
Girls -- I'm going to Harvard!
I did?
I don't know --
His twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy.
Class schedule, map, book list.
Wait -- my social events schedule is missing.
You're beautiful.
And I fully support that.
C'mon. Let me take you home.
Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the benches?
Well, yeah, but --
In court. On opposing sides.
And what is your boyfriend's name?
Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I'm serious enough?
Why so few?
Fool's magic.
We come watch... we come watch...
Your love.
You're magnificent.
God protect me.
Why have you brought me here?
Damn you!
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
Flozen foleva not good.
Twas Jimmy done that, I merely stood for the blame unfairly... but, here now, Ogg, this be no time to rehash old differences, I've friends along in need of safe haven for the night.
No!  Tis not the time!  I want no part of your frolic.
No... I... I need to rest.
Don't you know?
Someone worthy of respect, lad.  She be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  Hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them.
Think there be truth only in beauty, lad?  If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek.
Are we here?
The princess is dead.
If the horn be restored the curse is ended.
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
Damn them!
How do you plan on finding this here castle, if ye don't mind me asking?
Track the demon to his lair.
Beware.
Worse than the battlefield.
Good.
Shhh!  Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.
Make haste!  We've a hard day's march ahead.
Is she... dead?
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
Why not admit it, Honeythorn Gump. We've lost our way entirely.
Wait, Jack.
That be so, better you pinch yourself now, Jack.
There isn't much time!
He'll be atop the portculis ere long.
Aye.  We're good as inside.
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
She's sore hurt, Jack, tis true, but not dead yet.
Hey!  Stop it!  I can't see.
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
The quest's at an end and where's the good of it?  A faerie festival over a pile of bones?
I'll do anything... face any challenge!
She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did.
Keep me belly full, Jack.  Kill us another worm.
Ogg lives there...!  And Thurgis!
Dolt!
These for me?
Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn?
A promise is a sacred oath.
I detest serpents.
Oh, dear.
Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
Where are you going?
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
He did run?
My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.
Tis not fit for a princess.
I have no wife.
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
I thought you were dead... I --
What?
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...
Nay, dearest Jack... you are to be my husband.  I want none other.
You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
I can't see a thing.
Step lively now!
Sigurd's sword...
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
No!
As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.
And charmed, of course.
In every way.
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
The fastest in the world.
Praise be to God.
Where?
Sorry, Jack.
Forgive my blood haste, Jimmy Squarefoot, but I want no more surprises from Couer de Noir.
Can you show us the way?
In a dream.
You can go back to bed...or Lois might let you go swimming.
And video games after!
What's that for?
I couldn't get it to go down.
What are you doing up so early?
I'd be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom.
You have to ask like that?
Not really.  No.  Kinda.  He got busted?
I'm coming in.
Why are you so uptight?
Josh said...
Not really.
You hate your father.
You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.
I wouldn't want you as a friend.
Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
I hate to ask about a window.
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
I have the permit.
Pardon me?
Right...she married...what was he?
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
Maybe...?
Class of eighty-six!  I didn't know you were there.
What are you talking about?  You love your job.
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
I've got one favor to ask.
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
You'll have to explain that to the police.
It'll just be my brother the dweeb on weekends.  All we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin, dude.  My dad's gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod.  Income village is the place to hook up with hump.
Because I live there.
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
I'm not going!
Are you totally insane?!
Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing?
It bugs me.
I don't know.
You'll have money when you work.
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
Do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
Hi, Alyssa.
I know parts of who you are.
I'm proud of you, Sam.
Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
I mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what?  Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain.  And you're going through them quick.
I still don't know what that means.
I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
Can you build a house in four months?
Good for you.
Ah!  Oh....
I'm surprised he hasn't left.
God, you look like crap, George.
I called everyone, everywhere!  You just vanished!  You could be dead!
I didn't think you'd know I went missing.
Kurt's been feeding him.
I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
The garage.
When's school over?
Forget it, really.  I'll survive.
No.  I was going to let you do that.
We're fine.  Turkey sandwiches.
I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
What is it?
Oh...with his ear infection!
Go in there and lick his attitude.
With your hands or your tongue?
Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us?  She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing!  What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there!  He's not there!  And when he is, he isn't!  So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George.  I'll stop coming.  But it won't be because of Peter.  It'll be because you asked me to stop.  Say what you need to say, because I'm not leaving until I hear it.
I thought we were helping.
When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
I could die.
I better get the kids home.
Been thinking?
What's your deal with Alyssa?
To shave your chest?
I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.
I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is.
I can't go right now.
Despite you.
You got a dog?
Do you know anything about building a house?
I guess I could teach you some things.
There were no PG's.  So I just gave them money to play games.
You're sure about this?
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
Queer.
Go tell your father we're eating.
No, nigger.
He's a big one.
I'm talking about a haircut.
We get the games on the radio sometimes.
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
Why not?
Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line.  What's wrong, baby?
Engagement ring!
Claude Banks. How could I forget that? You've got to remember me. Ray Gibson. We went to high school together.
No, tell me what's so funny.
That's right, a loan officer.
How would I get a loan, anyway?
My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.
Ah, go chase yourself. I'll take my business elsewhere. And for future reference, you are no longer welcome at Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
When there is, you can forget about it. And I swear to God, you ever talk about my daddy again I'm gonna kick your bank-telling, loan-denying ass, you got me?
Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude.
I said you're soft.
Oh, I don't know, maybe because our lives depend on it, I just sort of thought you knew what you were doing!
Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
You lost all our money in a card game?
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
Yeah, nobody puts 'em away like old what's-his-name.
You know what I'm saying.
I'm not gonna forget it. What does that mean? If you've got a plan, I think I have a right to know about it. I told you my plan.
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.
Don't mention it.
Keep it together, Claude. You wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.
God may have given it, but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it.
It's a pardon from the governor.
You're a sucker. I'd have taken that deal.
I know, but since we're talking, I thought I'd mention it.
Don't make me take them away from you.
Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with this.  Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. See, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. And it's not that I like you or anything, but I've kinda gotten used to having you around.
Nurse Humphries was checking my prostate this morning. I got an erection.
Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
I can't eat this.
Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
I know you're not talking to me...
Too hot, huh? Well, you tell that lazy jiggaboo the state of Mississippi ain't interested in his meteorological assessments.
He's from New York City. That one, too.
Alright, listen up! I want every man lined up out here in the yard on the double! Let's move it!
Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.
So it don't exist.
So Ray and Claude got their pardons, right?
That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.
Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.
I can't believe this. I always said I'd never end up like this. I thought I'd make something of myself, do something with my life. You know, be successful. Have a big house, a family. Now I'm gonna end up just like daddy.
They gave me life, mama.
Is everyone here?
Lemonade?
If you don't mind my saying, you seem mighty familiar with your house boy.
What's going on here?
He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins.
Who?
Hey, Ray, you ever been to the Cotton Club?
How you doing? We're looking for Slim.
Blacks welcome there?
Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
Now will you get in the flask?
I knew it. He's finally retiring.
Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
And give you a good buzz.
I'll call her later.
All these good people have totally been led astray.
What's Nicky doing down there?
So far, so good. Now what?
This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so...
Now that was an experience. "You are only coming through in waves." That line blows my mind every time.
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
Thanks.
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
Look who's back from the dead.
This don't look good.
Which way did he go?
Come on. One more time.
So I was driving to work today, and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
So I followed him...
I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
Adrian?
Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him, not sure why.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
It's freezing my hands.
You have a dog? What kind?
I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
Hey.
..."The Devil?"...
We're going to Jersey?
Do me.
A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.
How do you think we got here??!!
Is that the wind?  Not yet...  You must hear my birds sing.
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
That's better.  How do you want us?
How did they get in here?
What other food?
It's a real privilege, Sandman.
Do you have anything special in mind?
Had enough?
You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6.
But you don't know, you just say what everyone says. "One for one. One for one."
No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
What the hell took you so long?
That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!
Please... no?  You mean "not here" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular.  Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you.
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
Let's have sex.  I thought you were curious.
You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to --
Are you a 5 or a 6? 
You could have called me yourself.
I don't believe you. There has to be more.
About running, dying what?
If you trusted me, you'd know.
They're like beasts. Wild.
Instead of what? Nine months inside a woman:  We're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in Cathedral.
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
I wanted to...  ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
We can't. We're going back.
I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
What does that water do?
Of course... that's settled then. But just you remember your promise...
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
I know...  We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it.
Can you make it back?
You okay, man?
You're a musician?
Why not?
Like you'd get if it was hand held.
Can I call you?
Hello.
You like it?
Pornos.
How'd it happen, Alice?
I'll set it up for tomorrow night. You'll meet me at his place at eleven o'clock... Don't drive there... Take a bus... Make sure no one follows you... His address is easy to remember... It's 2224 Deep Dell Place... It's a white stucco job on the south side of the street... I'll be upstairs with Andy... The back door will be open... That leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there's a bar there... At eleven fifteen, I'll ask Andy to fix me a drink... When he does, you can crack him in the head... Okay?
Are you my man?
I don't. I don't know him.
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you and Mrs. Trueworthy. Can you take care of Mr. Smith now?
Better.
Goin' out with these clowns for a while.
His condition? What do you mean?
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
Where's Pete?
Who is this man?
He's not Madison?
I'll get a manual.  and study it.
There's no other bedroom?
The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning.
At your house. Don't you remember?
Same one you were reading the other night?
We've got to call the police.
We will.
Where would you feel safe?
Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that. 
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
Beautiful! Smooth as shit from a duck's ass. Let's take a ride.
At sixty?
Hello.
You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right?
What's goin' on?
What's happening to you? What happened to your face?
Last time I saw you.
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
What else about that night?... Did anything happen?
Sheila?!
Why don't you like me?
Well, there's certainly nothing wrong with that meal!
Not even a radio?
I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in Asia.
Yes, it just shows—  I don't know why I'm talking to you. I don't know you. Who are you?
I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.
Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?
Chalmers Bryant!
Hey, what's happened to you?
Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here.
Yes. I've just been talking with the porters. They're going to take us. We've got clothing, food, everything. Come on!
Oh, good heavens, no!
Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them?
I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
I surprise you? Now that's news.
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
Yes. I'm afraid it does.
Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"—  Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "
Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
As far away as I ever want to be.
Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey.
He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.
The power house - they've blown it up! The planes can't land without lights.
Just what I needed too.
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
What are these people?
What's it mean?
Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
Porters?
Let me up! Let me up!
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned—
I'd go mad!
George, are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you, I mean?
What's she got to do with it?
The clothes?
No. That's not possible! If we had landed, we all would have been awakened.
I guess we're in for it.
Oh, please. I hope you're not going to run away this time.
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.
Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
Ouch!
Oh, the usual reasons. A world full of people struggling for existence.
You know, if you keep on asking that, we're not going to get anywhere. And don't ask me why.
It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
Thank you.
The hell happened?
Sir, before you boot me, I just want to explain.  I mean, okay, you got a goat-guy with a hook for a head...
Wait.  Uh-- sir.  Please.  Anyway.  Hook-head-guy.  I'm thinking "how can he think with a hook for a head?" Answer: that's not his head. Then I think--
So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
From now on, you'll respond only to the name "Jay." You'll dress in appropriate attire specially sanctioned by the INS Special Services. You're not to stand out in any way.  Understand?
So... wait.  You just asked... but he goes so fast, he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it.
You do?
Which do you have your money on, Dee?
Ha ha.  No, really.
What?
Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
Looks like a train ticket.
The radio show?
You think that's what's-happening?
Oh, yeah?  Fill us in, why don't you.
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
Maybe they didn't get here.  Maybe they've been here.
I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
And I'm arranging deportation papers.
Nowhere.
Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?
Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
Hmnn... wall, it's funny, cause usually I'm not all that attracted to stupid guys, but--
Really nice wheels, by the way.
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
Hard to tell.  I hope not.
Why, you might ask?  Because you're ready.  Because you've finally gone as far as you can go without it.
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
What?
I can't.  I have to know.
Oh, God...
About who?
And replace them with new ones.
I put you away --
So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
You the sentry?
You the only sentry?
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
Looks like she was a neuroin addict like John Doe here, but I show an address history that includes the Beaton Clinic.
You understand that a week from now people are going to vote on whether or not what we've been doing down here has been some noble-minded enterprise or a chance to change the way this country fights crime.
I need you to do two things for me. One, watch Danny Witwer.
Just so you know, I've overridden the vehicle locator.  I just wanted to talk to you before Justice --
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
Uh, sir...
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
We need confirmation on the time frame.  Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
Go ahead.
What?
Red Ball?
Confirm with trig and image.
Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.
It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
Really?  You've never been inside?
You set me up...
She spoke to me.
Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
Are you reading my mind right now?
What the hell.
I forgive you.
I forgive you...
I was looking for you...
I wanted to.
Six years ago.  Baltimore.  You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.
Do you know who I am?
You're not gonna kill me?
What about the picture --
Why should I trust you?
That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
I understand.
But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
The guy from USA Today is here.
Sir, the press conference is starting.
Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar.  Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  He's my suspect.
Good God.  What was that?
It's the same prevision.
I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
What?
Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here, and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing, but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
Anderton's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can't ID him to pick his pocket.  There's fewer consumers down there, which means fewer scanners to target him.
There are two others in the room besides Anderton and Crow.
If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?
People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.
Why don't I feel like celebrating?
John Anderton was my friend!
Raincheck?
No.
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
Since right after we lost our son.
He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...
You know I need to use you.
To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
Nice to meet you, Wally.
Yeah.
He'll be a minute, hon. You want some coffee?
Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time.
Now, Mr. Slade, you're in room 315.
Yes, sir.
All the suites are about the same.
Thank you, sir.
As far as...?
Oh no. What is it this time.
A elephant seal. Where's mommy?
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
You talk to Max today?
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
Goodbye, Bobby.
I -- I -- I... Don't...
Well, you look it. You win?
What's his name?
So what do we do?
Brooklyn.
It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
Where's Ricky?
That it?
Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it?
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.
I didn't say that.
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...
Any time, bro.
You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.
So, it was a draw.
That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record --
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
Oh, give me a break. Look at her. She don't even know where the hell she is. She'd have more fun at Bordner's.
I don't know.
Right here's fine.
Holy shit. Can you believe this?
How much is it?
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
Oh really. Why's that?
What are you doing?
How'd they know who you were?
This is bullshit, man.
You sold it? I thought they stole it.
Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
So is this the drop?
You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
He wants to see us now.
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
Wanna bet?
That's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
No.
What about it?
So what do we do?
Three and a half hours?
Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
Fine, fine. And you were...?
C'mon...
Kinda. Yeah.
Yeah. I want it.
Cardiff Giant?
Did you see that shit? Motherfucker.  You let in fucking Screech, dude? I'm waiting and you let in Screech?
Yes?
Stop.
Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
No?
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
Sorry about that. Where's your mate?
Good morning.
Last thing I want is you with a gun.
Ricky.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So whenever we want...
Nigger, please. Don't even order that artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks, Leo. We gotta roll. What do I owe you?
dollars in c-notes, a numeric pager, a double-A battery, and a first class round-trip ticket to JFK.
That money is your per diem.
Yeah.
What about my keys?
Don't worry. I get it.
No...
The Red Dragon.
Edinburgh.
I'm working trains. Selling.
I told you less paper, less trouble.
Ain't nuthin' in the world to give you that real deep cool. Like girl. You there?
Shit, what else she gonna say?
You're a damn liar.
What did you give it to me for then?
Putting all that poison in your hair.
Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
Don't con me. Don't try...
I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.
Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant- eating African mammal. Man, that sounds like the dozens.
Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.
Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's supposed to make us forget 400 years.
I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
I can't.
I'll have it tomorrow.
Folks are sitting out there today, not next week, expecting to hear our program.
Make it plain.
That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
At a gas station.  Will you marry me?
I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore.
I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that.
I just want to sit here and be still.
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray.
I don't care about myself, my wife and four children were sleeping in their beds, they have nothing to do with this.
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
I assumed...
Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
Why don't you just ask your question?
Stop me if I'm wrong. I "polarize the community." I "erroneously appraise the racial picture."
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
She know?
Get out.
How many you turning out?
All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
Sheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty.
Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler "rape," sister?
You will, baby -- if the time come.
Hey, man, gimme some skin.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart.
I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.
What did you do, Homey, palm it?
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
Head nigger in charge?
I'm Minister Malcolm X. Two witnesses saw him brought in. He was not brought out.
Only a pig could do a thing like that.
The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that?
My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.
[Why?]
It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The religion of La Hermanidad. There's a curse on you.
Maybe I can help your situation and you mine.
[What is his name?]
[Who killed her? You?]
[Who's Tazinari?]
[She's late, Mr. Creasy.]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
[The girl's. Pinta's.]
[I don't know him. I saw the opportunity and got lucky.]
What is it?
Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. What's the catch?
How does it affect you?
I'm here.
How long you staying, Crease?
Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
There's still ink on my fingers from last week.
Fuck. Look at you; you won't last a day the shape you're in. Unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen removed.
Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth.  Rocket launchers?
That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him with when he left.
In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?
And don't start crying.
What are you doing?
They'll be back in a week.
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
You're late.
I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.
What's so important in Los Angeles?
The blocks.
You don't drink like you used to.
That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
The world of our children. How dare they?
You're American.
Creasy... Wait.
I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
You need a bodyguard of some description. It's a dangerous world we live in. But you will get what you pay for. He doesn't need to be Superman, does he? Can you go fifteen grand?
For an American she understands this country very well.
[I need a driver to drive Samuel, the father.]
You should be sleeping, baby.
Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English.
I'll call you from Detroit, baby.
I think it's nice he's American.
It will be a hard break.
[He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]
[Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]
Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.
None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.
Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
I told you she wasn't especially attractive, but that she had a good deal of charm, and she's really a real nice girl...
I told you she wasn't attractive...
Hey, Herbie...
You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?
So what do you feel like doing tonight?
Who you gonna call?
Boy, you really musta made out good last night.
Marty, your mother wants you onna phone.
So I am an old garbage bag, put inna street.
Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.
Marty.
Well, that's all. You will see. Today, tomorrow, inna week, he's gonna say to you, "Hey, Ma, it's no good being a single man. I'm tired-a running around." Then he's gonna say, "Hey, Ma, wadda we need this old house? Why don't we sell this old house, move into a nicer parta town? A nice little apartment?"
You will see. A coupla months, you gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law's house.
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
...you teach chemistry? That's funny. Where? What school?
...When I got outta the army, Clara, I was lost. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was twenny-five years old, what was I gonna do, go back to my old job, forty cents an hour. I thought maybe I go to college under the G.I. Biller Rights, you know? But I wouldn't graduate till I was twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old, even if I made it in three years. And my brother Freddie wanted to get married, and I had three unmarried sisters -- in an Italian home, that's a terrible thing. And my kid brother Nickie, he's a one got married last week. So I just went to pieces. I used to walk inna streets till three, four o'clock inna mornings. My mother used to be so worried about me. My uncle Mario come over one time. He offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift. He got his own cab, you know. And God forgive me for what I'm gonna say now, but I used to thinka doing away with myself. I used to stand sometimes in the subway, and God forgive me what I'm going to say, I used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels.
I'm a Catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.
Siddown, take off your coat. You want something to eat? We gotta whole half-chicken in the icebox.
So I was telling you, my kid brother Nickie got married last Sunday. That was a very nice affair. And they had this statue of some woman, and they had whiskey spouting outta her mouth. I never saw anything so grand in my life.  And watta meal. I'm a butcher, so I know a good hunka steak when I see one. That was choice filet, right off the toppa the chuck. A buck eighty a pound. Of course, if you wanna cheaper cut, get rib steak. That gotta lotta waste on it, but it comes to about a buck and a quarter a pound, if it's trimmed. Listen, Clara, make yourself comfortable. You're all tense.
You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.
We better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now.
What happened, Angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking. Listen, Angie, I want you to meet Clara...  Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. I told you about him.
You got an elevator in this house?
So I'll call you tomorrow.
It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. Pilletti. I hope I'll see you again.
What?
Are you kidding?
Herbie! Wadda you doing here?!
I'm just here with another girl.
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
And that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he?
All right, I'll see you, Thomas, because he wants an answer by Monday.
Wadda you wanna buy a shop for, will you tell me? You gotta good job, you got no wife, you got no responsibilities. Boy, I wish I was you, boy. Waddaya wanna tie yourself down with a shop? What's he want? Five thousand down? You're gonna have to carry a mortgage sixty, seventy bucks a month. A mortgage anna note from the bank. For Pete's sake, you're a single man with no responsibilities. Stay that way, boy. Take my advice.
Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.
Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
How'd you come home, Ma? Thomas give you a ride?
Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it's getting a little late.
I don't know! She don't look like Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian girls around.
So these two girls come over to the bar...
...and they sit down right next to me...
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
Waddaya mean, Ralph?
Your kid brother got married last Sunday, eh, Marty?
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
When you gonna get married, Marty? You should be ashamed of yourself. All your brothers and sisters, they all younger than you, they married and they got children. I just saw your mother inna fruit shop, and she says to me, "Hey, you know a nice girl for my boy Marty?" Watsa matter with you? That's no way. Now you get married.
Sure.
Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, "Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, "Catherine, my sister..."
No, Virginia, I know how you feel.
Marty, I don't know how to tell you how much I appreciate what you and your mother are doing, because the kinda thing was happening in our house was Virginia was in the kitchen making some milk for the baby. So my mother comes in...
Wadda you so sore about?
...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!
There's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention.
What do I do with it Hawk? This is a little out of my line.
I may need you to go to work practically immediately. But meanwhile perhaps you'd like to meet some of your fellow officers.
Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?
I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
Where?
Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?
Well, he's taken care of. Scratch one hot dog.
This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
Us. Lead us not into...
We got to stop them right here.
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
You got directions?
Well, there it is. Jesus!
Little light reading matter. Just right for his age.
Now that's what I call real pretty. We can close up here and go into his belly.
No, Hawkeye just said it all.
Best equipped dentist in the whole goddam Army. Care to have a look, a man with your background?
That there Frank Burns is a menace. Whenever a patient croaks on him it's either God's will or somebody else's fault.
When will he be able to write?
Never heard of him.
Let's hear from you, you goddam Yankee. Be nice to see you some time.
Frank...
Is that liquor?
If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
What for?
That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home.
Or you can let him knock himself out. You personally'd be sending him to his grave.
It's in pretty deep.
He only lasted one season.
So what makes you think he'll play for us?
But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.
Our minds?
And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake.
It was really nice of you to take me along.
You don't go after the local scrunch?
Why can't you look at him?
What's wrong with him?
If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.
I have not understood what you means.
Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
You don't aim to cause any trouble – But?
About that chest-cutter...
Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason.
It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.
Yes, that's what I mean.
O'Reilly!
Sir?
To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
Can you make out what they're talking about?
As long as there's a pile-up, we can do our bit to encourage his permanent withdrawal from the contest.
Did you get it, too?
Er, would you, er, would you like to make some money?
Action?
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
Do you care if I sit down out here?
Go ahead, driver! Ball park!
. . . Er, this John Doe idea is yours, huh?
Oh!
Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party.
Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
What?
Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.
I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say.
No. I've had the whole army and navy searching for you because that's a game we play here every day.
The letter.
Well, the whole town's curious about John Doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. There's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!
That's fine! That's fine!  Now fall right into their laps. Go ahead. Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing off. You know what that's going to sound like on top of this!
Okay, sister, you get your job back.
Looks all right—
That's our man. He's made to order.
Hurry up, Pop.
All right, boys, here he is.
Well, okay. But we don't want more than a couple o' hundred people in on this thing. Now the first thing I want is an exact copy of the John Doe letter in your own handwriting.
Look. We can't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. Good night!  No telling what that screwball might do. I walked in yesterday—here he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
Colonel!
Where'd you play?
Hello! . . . Yeh?
Yeah, Boss?
Hey, Boss.
Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc. Gimme that again, will yuh? Who's gonna get him?
Ba-ll!
St-rike!
Well, sir, about a dozen families got together and gave Grubbel a job watering their lawns. Isn't that wonderful? And then we found jobs for six other people and they've all gone off relief!
Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!
Jitterbugs.[9] Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL.
Four bits.
All right! Now, supposing a certain unmentionable worm, whose initials are D. B., was trying to use that to shove his way into the White House. So he could put the screws on, so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses. What would you say about that? Huh?
I see. I'd better stick to running the paper, huh?
Only one thing to do, Hank. Drop the whole business quickly.
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and—
If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite.
Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
What are you doing up here then?
I know one way you can do it.
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
Say, who's putting up this dough?
Have you got the speech I gave you?
Now, look. I'll give this money to the Colonel just as soon as you get started. We'll have a car waiting at the side entrance for you.
I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
No shit! He's good!
Apartment 306.
What happened? Is there a problem?
How can I help you with the particles?
Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
Where's the car?
The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
Anything on Korda so far?
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
You don't have to come here.
For now that's all.
Satisfied?
You ever been in a hostage situation?
I'm sorry about your friend. I had a friend in SWAT killed. I know how it can be.
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
You don't like New York?
How are we gonna get him out of there?
Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide.
Where did you hear that?
You think you can learn, McCall?
Tell me what you need.
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.
To save lives.
We won.
Is it always like this?
He's got the girl.
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?
Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
Hey.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
You think I didn't need you?
What do you think?
What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
Scottie?
Yeah.
Tell him to give me a raise.
Roper.
Are you going to make this hard for me?
And a car.
What do we got?
Are these yours?
System's running on auxiliary.  Only seven hours before it crashes.
It's okay.
Why?
She said I have a son...
You were right.
What's happening?
Divinity?
You sealed off the system.  When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
Until you're on the net where the corporation can't touch you, you can't open the system.  They'll eject it if you do.
And what about the reconfiguration?
You sure he's going to come?
How long 'till we can eject?
How long?
What's her name?
Get some internal police there. Tell them to run a perimeter.
Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
Won't be time if he gets access --
A hotel?
An interface attendant.
Need the disk back!
Then how do you know about --
You said we were on the same programming team.
I wasn't with you.
What's so funny?
It was just there.
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --

The Stealth Eagle is about to fly.
The earth was hurtling toward us at seven hundred miles per hour, and we knew at that moment that we were facing death straight in the eye.
... A falcon?
Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.
Simon says...
I hope those Rangers put that lousy lowlife out of his misery!
Anybody see them?
Six become one... the combined forces of the Ninjetti.
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
You own a hotel, sir?
You ever been near a meat packing plant? My father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
When my money moves, I go with it.
We could lose the deal!
It consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. We try to oblige.
Where'd ya get this funny ravioli?
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
The deal's too good, Frankie
A hundred-seven bucks too much. Any kid who drops an extra dime is gonna be talkin' to Moliari.
Well...
What's the matter?
You got something to hide?
So you all make the same mistakes?
Would it be painful for you?
Meyer.
Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
How soon can we pull this off?
You're getting' 10 cc's
You bastards, I said twenty!
It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.
You and Vito are gonna pull that payroll job. Right now.
So tell me when I ain't done it.
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you.
He's an animal!
Tell me, my son. Why did you go with Giuseppe? He's not our kind.
Conditions have changed. Some people have become too powerful.
Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
We must be friends, Charlie.
Know somethin'? This stuff's just kick-the-can on ponies.
Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
What's it worth to ya, Boss?
Know something Tommy? You're a mensch.
Best we got.
Special occasion?
Who did this?
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
Jesus, honey...he always joked about you <u>curing</u> him, but I never realized what you cured him <u>from</u>.
Chasing me - animals - horrible -
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare.
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die.
Vital signs have stabilized. That's good.
At the moment, yes.
What's the matter?
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. We get a big piñata. We fill it with Monkeybone dolls - <u>hundreds</u> of 'em.
Uh huh. And?
Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a <u>putz</u> - and I should know. I'm his little brother.
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
Bitchin' good cake.
Sure. Why?
Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me!
And speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy.
You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you!
Can't you give it to me later?
Look at this! He won't let us leave!
An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?
I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
Hypnos?
You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could <u>both</u> be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't <u>count</u>.
I'm so dumb! I <u>deserve</u> to die -
Where'd he go??
Stu...Stu...
It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?
Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
He seemed quite taken with you.
You know, you never tell me anything.
What's wrong?
It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?
Here you go.  I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing.  Okay?
Mother!
You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single.
I came to New York to visit my youngest daughter.
I see.  How much?
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.
All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
--what possible explanation can you offer for this charge being--as you say--"trumped up" against you!
Yes, sir--big as life. Been there some time now.
Sure. Sure. I'll hang a light in the steeple. One if by land--two if by sea!... Okay!  Diz--you won't believe it. Daniel Boone's *lost*!
Tell me why!
Oh--that again. Yeah.
Diz, you're a swell playmate--but--. Maybe if I saw you once with your hair combed, or something--or--no, no--I don't think even that would do it--
What! Who?
Will you go chase an ambulance!
Kid--wait--what do you think you're going to do?
Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
Sit tight, Diz. The show commences in just a minute.
The Silver Knight. Soul of Honor--on a tight-rope.
Why do I always laugh at that?
Every time I think of it, I get a laugh, Diz.
Now, you've gone and let Don Quixote in here again. I told you to keep him out!
*All right*, then. After all, what's it to me? So they *drop* him out of a balloon. All I care is--I don't want to be around. See? Squeamish. See? That's what I am. No, sir. I don't have to take it. Won't be a party to no murder. I'm gonna quit. I'm through.
Diz--
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
Hey! We're gettin' married--!
Then--in the name of kindness to dumb animals--we can't let him walk into that Senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose! A couple of us went up there--told him all he could do was beat it--resign--clear out. But--he's in a daze--he's been hit by a ton of bricks. Just says, "I haven't done anything. Why should I resign?" He might *listen* to *you*--
Diz!
Taylor, my dear.
Emma! I'm a man at the end of his rope.
One minute! Just one minute!
They put up *their* candidate? Who?
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
You couldn't understand! Listen, Ten Thumbs, I'll be on my way to Washington in half an hour. Whatever happens, I'm all ready for this Ranger of yours. Never mind how. You'll get your instructions from Ken Allen here. It isn't anything you have to do. I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp. Allen'll do it himself. You just use your *high office* to help him get it done. Understand?
Now--now--please--that's quite all right. Relax, boys--
No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
Thanks, Governor--*yes*! Do you mind? His head--Ma'll take the tail.
"Boy Stuff." That's the name of Jeff's magazine. He prints it.  Look--here's one--oh, it's great-- *everybody* reads it--all the kids in the State--a million of 'em. Look, Pop--let me read you a--
I *thought* I heard... Yes?
Yes. Come in.
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
You should hear our Ranger Band rattle that off--if you want to *hear* something! Good evening, Miss Saunders. Good evening Mister McGann.
Will the Senator yield for a question?
Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
Yes, I was--
But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--
Ah, now, that's better.
I have no defense against forged papers and--
Oh, now--
Jerry! Blackie! Queenie! Let's have it quiet, fellows!
What is it?
*No*!
Now, if you're ready, Senator, we can start for the hotel. I'll *see* that you get there.
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
I see. *This* one is so simple--
A *day*!
Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
Pardon?
We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.
Yes, yes--
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
I've got more. You better tell me.
You--don't know it, do you?
Well--no. I didn't. Why?
Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here?
The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right-- the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.
Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.
Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*! 
Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
Ah! That's more like it! What?
I--I'm awfully glad to be--that is, it was nice of you to--  Uh--how's your father?
Well! Hear anything? Any sign of him?
I wouldn't wait if I were you.
What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
What do I *mean*, huh? Uh--*I'll* tell ya--World's Series--a pass! In a month it's worth fifteen bucks!
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
Yeah?  And what else?
What are you driving at? You want *me* to get him to sign that?
Why don't you do it yourself?
What do you think?
Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
Well, what do you want me to do? Stand around like you chump and let that drooling infant wrap that Willet Creek Dam appropriation around my neck. Either he falls in line with us and behaves himself or I'll break him so wide open they'll never be able to find the pieces.
You won't stand for it?
Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
You can't say *that* to--
Jim--the boy's talking to that State-- the story is out--!
Well, at the expense of some of the furniture, Susan--you've made another conquest.
Mr. President...
Will the Senator yield?
I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !
Order!
I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds?
Since he was born.
Any children?
No. Are you?
Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?
But they did take place?
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
You fainted.
No, thank you. I'll be all right.
Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.
You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?
You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.
I've often thought about going back.
He played in the town band, too.
Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
Mary, I'm going home.
In a day or so, I think.
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.
Hello, Mary?
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.
The guy's balmy.
You're a fool, Babe.
Why there she is!  Of course she's home.  Stupid of me . . .
With pay!
Marvelous!  "At two o'clock this morning, Mr. Deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. When asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'I just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'"  Beautiful! What happened after that?
Why, Babe - that's terrific!  "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That—"
What're you going to do?
Ow! My foot's asleep!
We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child.
Gold, eh?
Is that the best you've got?
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
Stuff, sir?
I wish you luck, sir.
The Falkner sisters are rather timid, Your Honor, and wish to be together. If the court pleases, I will only have one of them testify.
But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
That's pretty.
Look!
Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on.
Yes?
Where?
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds.
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds.  Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
Well, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment?
Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
You shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate?
What about your knocking off for lunch?
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit.
That's impossible. The opera has never paid.
You remember, Dr. Fosdick, in my last book there are some very fine examples.
Yes, sir.
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.
No - I don't want it, thank you.
No.
Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?
Anything else, Mr. Deeds?
Proceed.
Well, we could borrow a couple from Mrs. Simpson. You know, she went to Niagara Falls last year.
Tails tonight, sir?
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
No, sir.
Twenty! What did he do with them?
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
Yes, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?
Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.
But she's on the telephone—
Me, sir?
Pack my things, Walter. I'm going home.
-- The argument had nothing to do with it.
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads.  It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
But you do therapy?
Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout...
Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you again.
My mentor was an amazing teacher named Benton Mandlebaum. Died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo.
Why not?
Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you --
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
What is it?
Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
I feel like we're making real progress here.
We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc?
Yeah... me you, too... I was at your house...
That's a lot of people all at once.
You do?
It was Henry Follett.
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
...so rich?
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
But you know how to drive?
Hiya, Doc.
Do you think that's a good idea?
Finally, some common sense...
I think you do.
Just who is here, can you tell me?
Painful lymph glands?  Forget fulness... irritability... depression?
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in?
It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship.
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
I guess you saw the show...?
Sofie...
But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.
Fuck the community.  There was this article my friends and I read. It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed". It was very fascinating.
I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said last time. How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever...  Which we already knew...
Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
What are you talking about?
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, "If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."
What did he want you to do?
You're Doc Mumford.  Skip Skipperton.
Would you like another beer?
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
How many sessions have we had now, Doc?  Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.
Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something...
Slash what?
A doll?
Skip, that's not much of a secret.
Did you carry a gun?
How'd you do it?  The new you.
Psych major?
I guess that makes sense.
It's possible. I don't know about that.
I trained in the east, myself -- Cornell -- and I don't care what anyone says, there really are regional differences. I found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... Did you?
That was a terrible thing.
No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping!
He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
Immune from what?
Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy?
What just happened?
I'm sorry, it was an accident.
She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
The key!? She has the lost key!?
I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!
The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
A bright good morning to all.
So who's the broad?
Could you tell me how to get there? The exact location?
We're almost there.
For what?
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am.
You sure you outta be playin, around with that?
I'm staying.
Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt.
You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!
What do you suppose killed him?
She's my sister, actually.
Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
I knew you'd come. I left that skylight open for you.
And I know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
Atta, girl!
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
Casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it.
Eat your mustard.
Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.
But times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. I can see you still got the style, but I dunno for sure you still got the edge.
That boy's got talent.
Are you with me... or against me?
Who's the artist?
Come here.
Monica... I was wondering if -- uh -- maybe we -- I mean you and I -- could -- uh -- you know -- get a -- I mean have a...
Sure.
I admire you.
What's your real name?
Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
It's me.
Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful.
There's just not enough of us.
You know something? Those guys are really starting TO PISS ME OFF!
Your Spiderman Pez dispenser! 
Cover me!
Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em! 
So why don't you just tell her!
Let's go.
The who?
Maybe she's right.
But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
So where's the art?
So you're only invisible... to yourself?
Wow.
So what can I get you?
Hi.
She likes you.
Don't crunch the leaves.
Maybe it's time we checked that place out.
Where am I going?
Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
Yes -- who spoke up?
Please...
Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink?
We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
Paris has surrendered?!  I don't believe it.
I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
Josephine dead -- how unbelievable! How impossible it is to believe it. She was always physically so strong -- she was never ill a day in her life.
But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
She should have had Larrey or Corvisart.  They might have saved her... But why didn't anyone even write to me?  Can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have believed that I should read such news in a newspaper?  How incredible!
Captain Charles, I believe you are one of General Le Clerc's aides-de- camp.
Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
Then, you have my thanks, Captain Charles, for safely escorting Madame Bonaparte to Milan, and you may consider your assignment completed.
No, they're living in Nice now.
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
Just a minute, General.  Listen, don't let them fool you with all their grand la-de-da.  They've all made their money from the war -- mostly from crooked war contracts. They say Citizen Barras has put away millions.
Hello there, Picart.
Why are you carrying the dog?
When did it start?
Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
And he sent you to me?
I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.
Shall we move closer to the fire?
But he asked me to say...  on his behalf... that your achievements have increased his...  admiration for you, and that he believes... your success is predestined by heaven...  and that his army...
Thank you, Napoleon.
Then what brings you out on such a night?
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money.
Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.
The important thing is to find the right lawyer.  One who will not protract the thing indefinitely, in the courts.
Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?
Do you expect me to believe that?
And you, are you in love with any one else?
Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working.
Why did you give it to him?
Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
What was there to tell?
Do you know what you're saying?
How do you know?
Can you give me a drink, please?
And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits?
Do you like music?
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.
What I am talking about is moderation.
Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.
He made friends with a family called Columbier, and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter, Caroline.
Led by the warlike Queen Louisa, and her fashion-minded husband, King Frederich Wilhelm, the Prussians still believed themselves cast in the mold of Frederick the Great, and more than a match for Napoleon.  The King had a special collection of 60 splendid uniforms, and was personally involved in the design of all the Prussian army uniforms.
I know Alexander.  His imagination must be struck by some great, bold, powerful stroke, and he will come back to me, just as he did at Friedland.
On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded.  Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time.  The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.
Well, let me in.
Yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, Craig.  I never thought I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs.  But as soon as I got my check, I was gone.  Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.
Y'all never use it?
Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here?
Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend.
What's the green stuff poking out?
I ain't trying to rob you...
What's crackin'?
You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last?  Up at the family reunion.
Who is that?
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
Why?
$247.
You see that?
You make it sound so easy.
Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it.
I will.  When can I come visit?
Karla.
You did all this for me?
I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me.
You alright?
Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets?
I'll be out in about 35-40 minutes!
You coming in?
What kind of activity?
What it say?
That the big one, huh?
Are they still out there?
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.
Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar?
Tape his mouth shut.
Are you going to take me to see Mom?
'Take your car?'
Make sure you look after my son out here. Don't get him involved with none of your bullshit, Roy.
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
Need to lose some weight.
Don't remind me.
Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.
Where to, sir?
Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem...
I need your help.
You were saying?  Your daughter....?
Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you.
You were very nervous.
How do you know that?
Can we go now?
Could I see some identification, sir?
Yes, yes, I understand.
This says "invitation only".
Again.
No.
But...
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
He has to say "over and out". Daddy, you have to say "over and out".
Can we go now?
Mister, what are you dragging me into?
Oh, Jesus ...
Then why'd you drag me into it?
Keep the change.
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?
He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.
You have, huh?
Close your eyes.
Foreigners! Fuck!
You don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all.
That's enough.
What do you figure he done with it?
Think of it, Ben! With that cursed, bloodied gold!
If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you.
You understand?
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."
O, she's all right.
Here's your can o' hooks, Uncle Birdie.
And when little King Jesus' Ma and Pa heard about that plan, what do you reckon they went and done?
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
What's wrong, Mother?
Dear Walt and Icey: I bet you been worried and gave us up for lost. Took the kids down here with me for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm. Thot a little change of scenery would do us all a world of good after so much trubble and heartache. At least the kids will git a plenty of good home cooking. Your devoted Harry Powell
Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!
That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
Amen! Amen!
Hing, hang, hung.
Tell me a story, John.
You swore, Pearl!
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
Where are we goin', John?
Don't you hurt her!
I'm butcherin' my hog myself, smokin' the hams, and cannin' the sausage.  You-all have your work cut out!
John, where's your folks?
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
Nothin'. 
O no! Your turn!
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
What's their names?
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
John, Mr. Powell has got something to tell you.
Get up, Willa.
It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
Answer me!
Mornin', ladies.
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.
She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.
Nancy have any severe childhood illnesses? Scarlet Fever? High temperatures -- concussions?
How long's this been going on?
Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.
What the hell are dreams, anyway?
How can you tell?
Guess I did.
Okay?
Whenever I get nervous I eat.
Hello?
Much better.
Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is.
Bring him out of what?
Hello Nancy.
That'll be exactly half past midnight. Time for me to fall asleep and find him.
She lived there.
Nancy, don't fall asleep in there.
Take this, it'll help you sleep.
What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams.
What's with the bars?
Give me the key, mother.
Feeling better?
We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.
The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.
How could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it?
Do you think I did it?
What the hell you doing here?
Thank you, Comrade.
From Leon.
Aren't you late?
They didn't let me. I am in disgrace. Last week at the performance of Carmen I played a sour note. The conductor got so excited he yelled, "There's sabotage in the string section!"
I'll tell you later.  That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
An evening gown.
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
You want this?
No, that's not him...
You must help us, Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia!
...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
He's cutting our throat...
Misha! Misha!
That must be the one!
Yes! We could stay with Leon!
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
I am Comrade Buljanoff.
This is the apartment we have reserved for you, Comrade Yakushova. I hope you like it.
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
Good evening, Gaston.
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
Your breakfast, monsieur.
And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something.
I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.
We don't want to be disturbed.
What proposition?
You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we?
How much does this cost?
Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!
Allow me, Comrade.
What's that?
I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.
If there is anything we can do for you...
How are you, you three scoundrels?
Give me another double brandy.
What can I do about it?
On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
Believe me, I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't!
Yes!
Yes. Could you give me some information?
In other words you don't know.
Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
Why do you need my finger?
And where are we?
I do not deny its beauty, but it is a waste of electricity.
Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
And what do you do for mankind?
You are something we do not have in Russia.
That is correct.
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
What kind of a girl are you, anyway?
Do you hear that?
Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
Just smile.
Probably not.
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
You remember this room?
You see? Life can be so simple.
Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?
No... go on.
Did you make any change in this room?
She is very attractive. She has great elegance.  She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.
Comrades! Comrades!
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?
Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon?
Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him.
Did I hear something about jewels?
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?
There's a charming crowd here tonight, isn't there?
Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
Hello, Leon darling!
Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame.
How stale last night's gaiety looks! It has the taste of a dead cigarette.
That's all right... I grow on people.
I wouldn't waken Leon. After last night I would say not before three o'clock at the earliest.
My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps?  Or a nice little corner table?
I am sorry... I have to leave.
You're lawyers.  How can you let this shit go by!  Look!  This?  Nixon can't say this.
How's the job coming, Bob?
I'm still not confident we can ride through this.  Some people are going to have to go to jail.  Hunt's not the only problem.  Haldeman let me use the $350,000 cash fund in his safe to make the payments.  Ehrlichman had a role, a big role, in the Ellsberg break-in. And I'm ... uh, I think it's time we begin to think in terms of cutting our losses.
I understand that, sir.
I was sorry to hear about your wife.
Let's not forget they're just kids, they don't vote.
He's wrong, you know -- about Kennedy, LBJ, Truman.
McCord? ...
This is not a joke, John!
The country's loving it.
I would personally enjoy doing that, sir.
... Y'know Al, if Hoover was alive none of this would've happened.  He would've protected the President.
No, sir, you did not.
About a dozen.
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper.  You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation.
Howard Hunt? ... Jesus Christ, you open up that scab ... and you uncover a lot of pus.
I suppose you thought the Presidency was above this sort of thing.
Meanwhile, what happens to the country?
He wasn't protecting me.  He was putting me on notice.
The first assassination attempt was in '60, just before the election.
And not just Hunt.  Frank Sturgis, all those Cubans.  All of them in the Watergate.  They were involved in Track 2 in Cuba.  Hunt reported to my military aide. But I met with him several times as Vice President.  That's what worries the shit out of me.  I don't know how much Hunt knows.  Or the Cubans.
But, hell, this is nothing compared to Venezuela.  When I was Vice President, Ike sent me down there like a blocking back.  They threw rocks, broke out our windows, almost overturned the car. Read Six Crises, Bob.  Boy, Pat was brave!
Mr. President!
We really must go, Mr. President.
And his staff.  Come on, the copy they were filing from China was great.
The Jews aren't the middle, Henry. They're the far left.
Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport.
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
So that explains his press notices. Working both sides of the fence: Jewboy Henry, always trying to get his Nobel Prize, get laid ...
We've got to turn the faucet off on this thing.  It's out of control ...  You might burden just me with this in the future.
We could leverage Helms.
... I was wondering what's such dynamite in this Bay of Pigs story?  ... although it was clearly effective, because all of a sudden it was no problem for Helms to go to the FBI and try to put a lid on Watergate.
Oh, no, Harold.  He doesn't respond well to humor.  Maybe if you talk to Mother she can ...
Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
Not if I give you all the cards ...
No.  They make me sick.  They smell like death ... I had two brothers die young.  But let me tell you, there are worse things than death.  There is such a thing as evil.
What do you think this plan is, Edgar? A nuclear attack?
... little Bobby.
My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.  Oh, it wasn't a big house ...
Oh, my goodness ...
You'll win the nomination.
This damned tie ... Will you help me, Edgar?  Churchill used to say to me, "If you want your own history written properly, you must write it yourself."  All right, Edgar, but just don't let it come back to haunt me.
Who we working for?
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
Like you said Jack, I'm just a New York lawyer now.
I know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a Republican, and she'd do anything for the Party.
Hell, Kennedy's pissed Cuba away to the Russians.  And he don't know what the hell he's doing in Vietnam.  These are dangerous times, Dick, especially for business ...
Well, as you know, most of my staff have weighed in against this "incursion."  They believe it will fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily, and will result in crushing criticism domestically ...
That's right!  And if necessary, I'll drop the big one.
That doesn't matter now, Henry.  The point is, you might lose some of your media-darling halo if the press starts sniffing around our dirty laundry.
Mr. Nixon, it is possible for even a president to go too far.
Secret, Mr. Chairman?
I don't know.  He made me see the stars ...
Don't ever trust them.  They never tell the truth or honor their commitments.  Vietnamese are like Russians.  Both are dogs.
Yes, well ... Gentlemen, I promised my wife.  I'm out of politics.
How about Kissinger along with him?
Uh, wait ...
Where you from?
Hi.
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
We didn't come here to talk about football.  We came here to end the war.
It makes us human ...
This is just what they want, Buddy. Don't you see it?  They want to drive us apart.  To beat us.  We can't let them do it.  We've been through too much together, Buddy ... We belong together.
Dick, you should call Bobby.
Were you planning to tell me?
He looked old, didn't he?
I don't need that, Buddy.  I'm not Jack Kennedy.
No, I don't.  I'm not Jack ...
Penny for your thoughts.
Hiding what?
I'm the only left, Dick.  If you don't talk to me, you ...
It'll be over soon.
Some say you are, Rocky.
You heard it?
How fresh is this coffee?
...Your granddad never asked me to sign on as deputy. I done that my own self. Loretta says you're quittin'.
You're discouraged.
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
No money in his room there?
Yes.
No I ain't.
Who's he in trouble with then?
Does that look to you like about a '77 Ford, Wendell?
...You ride Winston.
...Somebody unloaded on this thing with a shotgun.
These boys is all swole up. So this was earlier: gettin set to trade. Then, whoa, differences... You know: might not of even been no money.
What about yours?
Probably must be.
Sheriff, that's aggravating.
You think this boy Moss has got any notion of the sorts of sons of bitches that are huntin' him?
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
Yes Noreen you better had. Thank you.
You gonna drive out there?
How's that, Sheriff?
Yessir.
...This month's checks.
...Be careful.
Maybe I'll go ridin.
What do you think.
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
It ain't even three years we been married.
No.
...You got no cause to hurt me.
That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?
Not like that. Not like you say.
I knowed you was crazy when I saw you settin' there. I knowed exactly what was in store for me.
What's in the satchel?
Llewelyn!
Big talk.
So... for how long do we have to...
Mama's gonna raise hell.
What should I do?
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.
I know where the money is.
Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
What's this about?
Mm-hm.
...Where's the transponder?
How'd you find it?
Yeah, that'll suck some power. Over time.
I don't know.
...You need to talk to me.
You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?
This. And the gas.
With anything?
Well... I need to see about closin'.
Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
Look... I got to know what I stand to win.
...Don't put it in your pocket.
Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.
Don't stop. Just ride me up past the rooms.
It's all right.
...I'm wondering...
...You pick the option with the applicable rate.
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
Lookin' for what's comin'.
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
It's called a transponder.
Not that way.
Took me about three hours.
Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.
...I'm across the river. At the Hotel Eagle. Carson Wells.  Call me when you've had enough. I can even let you keep a little of the money.
Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
Then I ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes.
Are you jackin' with me?
Don't jack with me.
Nam?
...I meant your food.
Sheriff, I don't...
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
You should get the order you want.
Why you always gotta embarrass me? I been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me!
Okay, let's go... I got nothing for the record yet.
Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
It wasn't a woman.
I see you're sticking to the diet Betty put you on...
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
Do you know who I am?
You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
What you did yesterday was reckless at best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. Are we communicating here?
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.
Why do they keep calling you George?
I guess we all did.  You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you...
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
I don't think your friend likes me.
So, call me when you --
Sure you don't want any salad?
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
...like the water purifiers?
Yes.
You're in serious danger!
Have you checked the trunk of that car you're driving, Betty? I think there might be...
Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
Dr. David Ravell.
You're hurting him!!
So why'd you come to L.A.?
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him?
Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that?  "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell." This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out?
Doctor David Ravell.
Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!
I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
...this is your sweater, right?
What?! That you had something to do with it?
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
Huh?
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
Relax, we brought the cash.
You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
Hold still, Del, we're just talking here...  Then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. It's amazing how easily the scalp comes off.
This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals.
So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
Betty, Betty, Betty...
Let's get out of here. We got another long drive ahead of us.  ...the fuck where I do not know, but I know it's gonna be long.
You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you? Nah. You're like me.
What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I'd just love to know...
What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
"When I grow up I'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral..."  Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you?
Well, guess what? I found Betty... where she's been, anyway.
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
Wesley...
What in the...  What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking time!
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
Don't  Don't you talk about Betty like that. I don't care who she ends up being, you never use that word again. Got it?
I said 'got it?'
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
She makes me stretch! I got inside my character last night like I haven't done in six years on "Reason". It was a totally rejuvenating experience.
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
Hmm?
Is there a problem, George?
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
Nothin' complex about it. Del's dead, Betty's gone. She's probably dead, too.
So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
You lie, motherfucker...
Yeah?
End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns -
Waitaminute -
...Pete?
Five... hunnert... thousand... each.
Damn! We gotta skedaddle!
So - where's all the money from your armored-car job?
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
What sat mean exactly, Everett?
We ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we mass communicatin'!
Finest governor we've ever had in M'sippi.
Them straw polls is ugly.
No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?
I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
Who was fixing to betray us!
Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.
...Nah, that ain't right... I'm thinkin' of...
Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing...
This is crazy. No one's ever gonna believe we're a real band.
Hold on there - I don't want this pomade, I want Dapper Dan.
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
Sir, we are Negroes. All except our a-cump- uh, company-accompluh- uh, the fella that plays the gui-tar.
It was a powerful air.
...Yeah?
Mama said you was hit by a train!
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
Great ass.
Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?
Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
Good morning, girls.
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
Esther, do you think she's using...  ...birth control?
When did this happen?
How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up.  You got an injury there, Mayo?
No, sir!
I don't want to do something anybody can do.
You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?
I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?
Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
What're you waiting for, Mayo? Get your scuzzy ass up here.
I know.
Daddy, I don't want to get into anything with you tonight. I'm tired and I...
Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
How late?
What other issue is there, Sid?
Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple of things I want to tell you.
Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean...
You what?
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
What did you tell him about the baby?
Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
I vote for the motel.
Paula, I never try to fool anybody about who I am, what I want... so if even in the back of your --
The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
So, after you graduate you go on to basic flight, right? Is that in Pensacola?
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
Your real father was an Officer candidate like me?
Please stop it. None of that's true. Goddamnit, I love you. I loved you ever since I met you.
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
How do you figure that's your bunk?
The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.
Jets.
Nice, hospitable folks they get around here.  I hope she comes.
You should've done what I did. A clean break.
Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
You're fuckin' A we can do this.
Stop it!  Stop it!
Are you okay?
Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you.  You can wait a half hour, can't you?
-- posed to mean?
Bullshit.
Fuck!
They're not supposed to be here!
What tables?  I've never seen him before.
Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  Or something like that, I'm pretty sure.
When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
Open it.
They're coughing.
Somebody called you?
What do you want?
I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.
Master bath.
Hey, this is perfect for you...  Absolutely!  You're a woman, you're living alone now.  Your alarm goes off, or you head glass break, or for whatever reason you think someone's broken into your home in the middle of the night.  What are you going to do?  Call the police and wait until they get here on Tuesday?  Traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings and check it out?  I think not!
We're not gonna do anything about him, he's fine.
No cars.  Feet are faster.
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
Damn it!
Small space?
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK OUT LIKE THAT!  YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE WITH ME!
He'll do something.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Alma I told you to...
Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your telephone number?
Lemme see that rifle son...
I expect to hear from you soon. If Huey Newton takes a crap, I want to know how big it was. Otherwise I'm gonna come looking for you. And I won't be as "friendly" as today.
What are you crazy?
Yeah... I'm fucked up. You're fucked up. Government's fucked up. Whole country's fucked up. You got no idea what's going on here. This is bigger than you and me. We're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. The Panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it.
Drugs Judge, they're gonna flood West Oakland with dope. Jack you up and string you out like a two dollar whore. And while the community's shuffling for a fix, they're gonna snuff every Panther they can find.
Have to pass on the revolution today man, I got class... But how about tonight, I was gonna check out "Cloud Nine." Just like old times.
...Glad you came man.
You got it. Berkeley?
C'mon we'll walk and talk...
Cy... Cy... Oh shit man... who did this to you. Was it the pigs?
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
Now hold on Rodgers...
These are memos from the commissioner, the mayor and Hoover himself, putting the Black Panthers and their subversive activities under the full jurisdiction of the Bureau.
But lots of our people don't read, man. They need strong imagery to help them out.
Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and Freedom Party thing. They really want to hook up with us. Do a rally together. Hell it'd broaden our base of visibility.
The time, my friend, is what Sartre called, "the moment the match is being put to the fuse." Question is, is the hand holding that match gonna be black or white.
Yes sir I was.
...at least that takes Bobby Seale off the street...
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
We'll get them. Right now we got to worry about being armed and ready to protect Betty Shabazz. Those phonies sure as hell can't. We need guns.
C'mon let's...
Alright, I'll stay. Judge, I want to...
Yeah man, but where's Judge?
That's right. We'd be proud to provide as escort for Malcolm's widow. How many men you got?
We put our lives on the line today. Malcolm X's widow was on the line today. And your guns weren't even loaded.
You were. infantry right?
We appreciate your help with this.
Judge... we're doing security for Betty Shabazz's visit next week. I'd like to have someone who knows there way around a pistol there. Someone like you.
Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift.
Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?
Whatever you need, I'll be there.
You were alright Judge, better than alright. You're what the Party needs. A fighter but also one that's going to school not making the man too nervous.
Me? You've got a whole lot of other folks signing up. Why me?
Yeah, I do.
Busted firing pin.  You want only the legal stuff right?
Fuck is up?!
Judge... I... I shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck...
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
He reminds me of you before you got old and ugly.
What do you mean, old and ugly?
You don't know him very well, do you?
I know him well enough?
You got salt last week.
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
Thank you.
And if I triumph, you triumph.
Father, a post rider came from Charleston.  You have a letter inside.
Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent.  He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.
What news?
Have you seen any Redcoats?
Father...
How old are you?
When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.
Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about.
Tarleton has a list of our men, most are on it.  A regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list, burning them, killing whomever resists, women and children, as well.
Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
We buried them, then we went to track.  It was a cold trail and they were moving fast.  We went faster. We caught up to them at Kentucky Ford.
An American nation.  Colonel Lee, with your permission?
We saw.
The bigger problem is where, not when.  The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.
Don't touch him.
Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
Goodbye, Francis.
Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently.
You may, of course, keep your weapons, but I must warn you that...
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
Reverend.
Thank you.
That bad?
Not yet, Thomas.
Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.
Yes, but the rope might be--
Please hurry.
Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?
That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much.
Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland?
Ellie? What's wrong?
Huh?
I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--
Ellie--
No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you.
God, that's fine.
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
I'm not climbing that.
Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.
What are those for?
But--
You and this old Indian rag-man--
Why, then, things should be fine.
--but I think the thought has crossed your mind.
I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on.
Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
Gage's gone!
The movers--
My God!
I think it's rather extraordinary.
That's enough of that kind of talk!
Getting there.
I heard you tonight.
You stole my boat.
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
What -- you don't have the medallion?
So how did you get off that island, anyway?
The situation has changed.
No reason to fret.  It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.
You have a name, missy?
Man overboard!
I apologize if I seem forward -- but I must speak my mind.  This promotion confirms that I have accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career.  But it also casts into sharp relief that which I have not achieved.  The thing all men most require: a marriage to a fine woman.  You have become a fine woman, Elizabeth.
Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal.
Actually, I find it all fascinating.
If I had known --
You are despicable.
Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!
What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island?
To freedom.
He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
Raise the sails.
Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
What's your name?
None?  Very well.  You rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go on the account, do a little honest pirating.
We had time to get to know each other.
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
Where does it make berth?
Agreed.
It's still against the law.
I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
Tortuga?
Wait -- what about the pistol?
Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship.  I'll keep 'em busy.
You haven't seen it.
What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith'?
Captain Norrington... I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.
Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
How long do you leave him in there?
What did you use?
... plastic.
The body is just another part of nature and ever since we gave up trees for central air, there has been nothing sacred about nature. Nature is the enemy, Mr. O'Brien, and science is our greatest weapon against her.
How apropos.
It remains to be seen who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. History is written by the victor.
Please, O'Brien, don't do this to me!  I'll give you anything you want!
She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon.
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
Do you think she will give us the designs?
And you still believe he's going to come here?
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
Dr. Makeo is working on it now, sir. I estimate at least another six hours.
Of course you understand, Dr. Argon, that once the nanobot is inside of you, there is no going back --
Excellent work, Dr. Nebbleman.  You have outdone yourself.
It'll be better for us if he simply disappears.  The gardener will know what to do.
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
Yeah, somebody broke in and stole the samples, one of those animal rights groups, right?  I remember now, they freed all the monkeys which caused that huge pileup on the Massachusetts Turnpike, right?
There's a guard outside my door! I'm a prisoner, Nigel!  Do you understand that?
Is that what Argon told you?
What's it smell like?
Like Crazy Glue?
Oh no.  Not by a long shot.  I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same.
You don't know?
Oh God, please!  This can't be happening!  I can't be plastic!  A plastic man?!
That was an egg?
Lungs sound fine.  You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you?  Allergies? Infections?
Just like old times.
What's that?
Did you go?
Oh no.  They're trying to blame you for the accident.  That means they must not have been able to control the replicators.
Run, Daniel!  Get out of here!
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you.
All the different ways that I could kill you.
If you don't have any questions, I'll let you get back to doing your job.
In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building?
Exactly.
I think I better go, Stew.
Don't mind Mother.
That's considerate of you.
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff—
Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married.
A little—? Sure, I'll be right up.  He's all right. I like him.
Your place?
We could have the whole left wing? Wouldn't that be nice! Would that be room enough for us?
You have the cutest nose I've—
I've got a present. Shut your eyes. Keep 'em closed. I know you're going to love them.
I know that.
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!
Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?
Anne, come here. Listen—
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
That's an excellent idea.
Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night.
Why doesn't Dexter show some decency? And you might show some too, Mother. What do you expect a man to do when he's called such names?  I'm glad you hit that reporter, Stewart. He deserved it.
What's the matter? Isn't there a 'bless you' in the crowd?
Impossible. Put it on again.
Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out. By golly, I'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore. You know our racket - after all, news is news.
Yeah.
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
Now listen boss, if you're going to kick about that expense account—
Well, when are you quitting?
Just a boid in a gilded cage -
How do you like your bath, sir?
What are you doing fooling around in here?
Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife.
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.
Well, I've seen her pictures, and I don't think she's so hot.
Sure - I think so, Stew.
There you are—!
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
They all consider me just as one of the boys.
To Old Madrid.
Now Gallagher, if we could only get a great scene - a tremendously emotional scene - something that would just wring the hearts out of the public - to bring the curtain down in the second act - that would be okay. Couldn't dig one out of your hat some place, could you?
Who was that?
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
Well, at best you might deny it.
Traps shut!
Hello, Smith.
We just thought that—
Yes.
Come in, Joe. It's all right.
Some bicarbonate - quick!
Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousand—and you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel!
And you struck him right here in our house—?
Heavens! The man's insane!
But I—
Did you call, sir?
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
Well sir, to be a putterer, one's mind must be at ease. A person with a problem could never be a putterer. For instance, sir, a fish can putter in water but not on land because he'd be out of place. An eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not in a cage, because he'd be restless and unhappy. Now sir, if you will pardon me, with all due respect, sir, as a Smythe to a Smith, you are an eagle in a cage.
No. I want to know.
You sure you want to know this?
Wait.
Where'd you get this?
Wait ...
What is that?
Sure you are.
Look at me George. That meeting's not for me. Look at my face.
What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important.
But where would we go?
To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
... Why?
Oh God! Are we in that episode?
I don't believe it.
What'll it be?
C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
I'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town.  You know what I mean by "changes"?
"Changes."  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?
Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
Did you do this?
Do you know that it's illegal?
Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall:  Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta.
Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE.
And where's that?
What's outside of Pleasantville?
David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.
God, David. Just give it to me!
I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.
You know him?
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
Can we do any better?
JENNIFER!
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED you.
You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.
Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault. They asked me what it was about and I like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, But I told them what I DID remember, and the next thing I knew the pages had filled in.
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
This thing works. We could go home right now.
Sure ... Where would we go?
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
What's going on?
It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it.
Look--it just sort of "happened" ...
Look ...
Where's the remote control I gave you?
Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control?
Because you're coming home.
There's worse places.
Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
Bud ...
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
No I know ... I know I do ...  But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ...
You know what I really like?
What's wrong?
Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?
You think you could do this like soon? It's almost six thirty.
Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.
Free?
Oh GOD ...
Yes, I'll be there.
I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
Hey, hey, you should ask her out -- what do you think, she's cute, right?
It's not cool?
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
Yeah I can't.
-- what are you talking about, come on --
Hello, this is Back.
No.
I'm going to work.
Yes.
I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I can't afford it.
Hello?
Why did you tell me you did, then?
Come on, I thought we had fun, rich boy --
Hi.
Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
What do you do with all this pudding?
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
Do you want to pick me up?
How long have you known her?
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
....No....
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
What happened?
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
Hi.
That was good.
I'll see you later.
I don't freak out very often.
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
Hello?
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
I just wanted to make sure.
Ok. So you were married for how long?
It's so nice.
Yeah.
I forgot about that.
Yeah.
Ok.
It's a plastic, yeah.
If you wanted to call me back I could...
On my knife.
Your hand is bleeding.
Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?
And your billing address and the name as it appears on the card?
That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
I'm a nice and reasonable man. I didn't do anything wrong. Please don't make me hurt you. And I'm telling you: that if you ever hurt me or if you hurt someone that I love.....I will hurt you many, many, many times over.....because it's not right to take people's trust.
How many sisters do you have?
How you doin' Barry?
...no....I don't....I don't remember you. Who's this?
Ok, sir....I'm gonna put you through to my supervisor.
Yeah.....you got here early huh?
Why is it here? Barry....Barry?
That's part of a very interesting airline promotion giveaway that's really tremendous. I'm going to start a collection of pudding and coupons that can be redeemed for frequent flyer miles through Healthy Choice and American Airlines --
No.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days.
Which guy in Toledo are you talking about?
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
I need to talk to you for a second.
No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --
HEY. You made a fucking sex call and now you're gonna pay. It's not a big thing -- just give us some money and then it's over -- we'll just walk down to the ATM and get your money out --
I'm sorry.
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
Yes I am.
Ok.
I know.
...keys for the track. You have to gas it up and save the receipts on that. His address. We have a business address too if you need that -- but hit him at his house first, see what this little bad boy is all about and shake him up -- give him a little doe-see-doe --
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
You wouldn't want to go out with him anyway, honestly, he's such a freak sometimes.
I'll just see you when you get back here.
"One day, Fanchon's first client was a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting each and every follicle..."
"To seal the wound, he took a poker from the fire --"
Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
Has he hurt you?
In part, yes.
Care for a splash of wine, Abbe?
Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the type's too small --
I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
You've a touch of the poet, too; perhaps you should take up the quill.
I have a proposition.
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.
WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?
If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive.
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
What on earth would that require?
It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man.
It's no secret that you loved her.
Go to hell!
NEVER!
Abbe de Coulmier!
I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- and of course -- the Marquis' wife --
He'll do no such thing.
This child let loose the beast from its cage --
Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name...
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
Will you sleep soundly tonight?
Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
Here it is; the last chapter.
At last she arrives, my hard-won bride! Hurry, my child, and scurry inside. There you'll find such treasures await you; Marzipan and meringue to sate you!
If you won't read it to your own Mama, then perhaps you ought not to be reading it at all.
"The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..."
You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy?
It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.
You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...
A kiss for each page.
"...your wife."
"By the time you read this, we'll be long gone; bound for England or points beyond..."
I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.
I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf.
Perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them...
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
Don't toy with me, Doctor.
I am eternally in your debt.
This is neither the time nor the place --
Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.
For fuck's sake, woman! BONBONS? I'm to sit here, gorging myself on useless trifles, sucking down your little sweetmeats, when what I truly need -- what I truly require -- are a few quill pens? Perhaps a pot of ink?
I'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon. There we can sit... side-by- side... before the fire.
Ever met Walter Winchell?
So you ever gonna do a picture?
Well, I wish you luck. It is a treacherous business.
Louis
Oh, why is that?
He is a Bolshevik. He will have us at war by the end of the year. I think I'm going to run that wheelchair picture.
The S.E.C. has turned down my request for relief on the debts.
Then you explain it to me?!
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
You are repellant when you drink.
I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me.
This is the chance you've been waiting for, boy. Tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him!
That's right. A symphony of those: vaunted and valued tellers-of-truth. Those heroic minutemen standing sentry on our liberties--
I wanna see the picture today
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
Nope.
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
The man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? This is monstrous.
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
Jesus
Oh for Christ's sake-
So, who is he? We have to know him.
All men love. But men like Hearst -- they don't bother with convention because--
I --um-- I don't know if I should. I ain't been drinking since I started on this--
And I'm looking at them -- and they're all looking at me and I don't know who should pour the tea. '
I want you back
YOU STUPID, LITTLE MAN! HOW COULD YOU HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN?! I GAVE YOU MY SOUL AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO SELL IT!?
What have I done?
May I help you?
Excuse me, I hope this isn't rude, but aren't you Marion Davies?
Not one of them today has what you had, Miss Davies. Not one of them.
It came.
Very generous
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud."
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud
You don't think I've tried? No one is willing to open the picture
Listen to me. The press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. And meantime I'm dealing with the stockholders in New York who are scared shitless -- and I'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. So you have got to trust that I'll do what I can to--
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
Look, not a single scene shot in the studio! We've found natural locations for the whole story--
It's my birthday this week. I'll be 26.
Orson, you wanna take five?
It's just not low enough. This is the scene. We have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky. As towering virtues in combat--
They wanna talk to you.
Hey champ!
All right. I don't have to hear any more. I think I understand what happened. I understand it was your brother's wife and there was probably a misunderstanding. I'm not sayin' Salvy shouldn't have acted the way he did. But, Joey, you don't raise your hands. You don't do that kind of thing. This time we forget about it but no more after this. You understand?
He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.
I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
J.R., glad you could make it.
You want me to do what?
Yeah --
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
With her? How?
I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk like that. She's still my wife.
He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
You want us to wait for you?
Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
Except fall down like a normal person.
All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait.
I'm gonna order up some stuff. Have a steak.
So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
Whatever you touched, that's good now.
What?
But you said "you."
You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!
I'll give you anything you want, Jake. I think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break.
He ain't hurting me, but I can't get him down.
You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
Jake...
You said never to touch you before a fight.
But, Jake, I was just...
I was just...
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
I didn't do anything wrong. I swear. I just had a few drinks.
You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
Can't you get the money from your friends?
Hi, Tommy. How are you?
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.
What do you think, I'm blind? My brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.
I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
Name me a better photographer.
I would say that is looked as if she wasn't coming back.
You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
Who said they left then?
Jeff -- huh?
A detective's nightmare.
Jewelry?
If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal, a big job, fame, money --
Jefferies.
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.
Like what?
Right now I'd even welcome trouble.
How can you tell that from a thermometer!
Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
That's normal.
It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.
It's very simple. She belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail parties.
Look, Mr. Jefferies. I'm not educated. I'm not even sophisticated. But I can tell you this -- when a man and a woman see each other, and like each other -- they should come together -- wham like two taxies on Broadway. Not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle.
People have different emotional levels that --
Keep your mind off her.
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
Huh?
You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?
You shouldn't have let her do that! If he ever --
I wonder.
When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this?
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?
Depends on the quote. Let's see -- there's the plane tickets over, import duties, hidden taxes, profit markups --
Something big going on somewhere?
What a day I've had!
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
Make the one you want.
Don't laugh. -- I could do it!
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
That's what is know as "manless melancholia."
Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one.
What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
Jeff -- if you could only see yourself.
Maybe she died.
Lisa, please!
That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
What doesn't?
A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
But only her husband would know that.  And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up.
They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too.
You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
Surprise -- is the most important element of attack.  And beside, you're not up on your private eye literature. When they're in trouble, it's always their Girl Friday who gets them out of it.
Whatever happened to that old saying "Love Thy Neighbor."
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
Well?
Something's in there. Those flowers have been taken up, and put back again.
Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look.
Chelsea 2-5598.
Steady Marlon!
What's that?
I thought only punks fought with knives.
Machismo?
Buzz Gundersen.
Sure.  It's fine.
I like you, you know?
That maid saw us.  She could identify us too.
Mother--
So long, young fella.  Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
Hey--I want to ask you something.
The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
Just give me a direct answer!  You going to stop me from going, Dad?
Sure--there was a bad accident there.  They showed the pictures on T.V.
Except yourself!
You know you did wrong.  That's the main thing, isn't it?
No.  I definitely don't.  I did the sa--
Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.
Can't you answer?  What's the matter with you anyhow?
I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
Frank?  I'm frightened.
I don't know.  First I thought it was Jim but--
Are you going down there?
She keep it to protect herself, sir. She scared without a man in the house.
Where did you get the gun?
Listen, I told you not to fool with them.  Now they're waiting for you.
You scared?
I'm here.
Nobody talks to children!  They just tell them one thing and mean another.
Isn't he schizoid?
You crazy nut!  You crazy, crazy nut!
Plato?
You sure?
Why?
What?
I'm sorry.
Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?
How can anyone grow up in this circus?
Hey!  That's enough static out of you.
Plato!
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
The kids take me.
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
They'll be looking for you.
I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again.
Why did you do that?
Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.
You can trust me, Judy.
How many rooms do you think there are?
Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets--
No!
You should have heard him talk about you tonight.  Like you were the hero in the China Seas.
What?
That one?
Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--
Didn't you forget something?
I was talking to Dad.
So. This is the guy you been waiting for. Man of your dreams.
Read you're a man of some knowledge.
Gabriel, you promised!
All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
Gabriel!
I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
Do that again.
Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
Where the hell are you going?
...the truck driver...
When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!
Gabriel!
He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --
He working for them on this one?
Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...
Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room?
He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.
No --
No, you can't --
You what...
So you could get with my sister.
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
What'd they call her in high school?
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
They wouldn't have changed the security setup.
Man, Monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me...
NO.
No gun.
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
Ash?
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
He won't tell us where it is. The Powwow Safe.
I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!
I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
Cancer-sucker.
Knew a guy in Joliet, smoked ten packs a day like you. His lungs got so black they couldn't find 'em with an x-ray.
This trucker? Met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. He's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. His tongue. Sucks it right down.
How long ago was your makeover?
You want that for here or to go?
Buffet. Whaddya think it is?
You gotta get someone upstairs.
DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!
She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting.
She's using a new perfume.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
Just a roach, Zook.
Rudy, don't move --
GUARD! GUARD!
Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
Switch seats with me.
You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --
That's what it looks like!
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.
I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.
Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
I don't know, but somebody did.
Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue.
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.
A little.
Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.
What?
Tell me more about Cabot.
Jesus Christ!
Mr. Brown?
How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.  When do you think you'll need me for real work?
Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy. Tell you what, let me be Mr. Purple. That sounds good to me, I'm Mr. Purple.
What's she doin' now?
What's the cut, poppa?
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?
I'd go over twelve percent for that.
I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
Nope.
I got the diamonds.
What?
He will be dead fer sure, if we don't get him to a hospital.
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
Of course.
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down!
He seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store.
Hello Graham -- Joe -- Mr. Gardner.
Anybody hurt?
Our kind of women?
What's the matter with her?
Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
Where do you keep the can opener?
There's a nice boy.
Get back to the horses. They're straggling.
Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
They're stragglin'.
I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.
You know so much about me -- figure it out.
I won't have you fighting over me.
Maybe it isn't going to Sonora, but it's going somewhere, which is all right with me.
I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.
Thanks for taking over.
Where you going?
Who's Lednov?
You never said this Lednov's name before, that I can remember.
That's Lednov!  We come along here.
It's all right with me if she teaches you, but I don't want you forgettin' your job.
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
I didn't stop to think, Clay.
Go on, hit me.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
What did you come back for?
You can light the lamp.  I'm sure glad it's you. We were afraid those killers might come back.
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was.
You're not bein' quite fair.
I can't take her with me.
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
Maybe you're going about this all wrong. Why not try telling him we'll do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' for him. That usually works.  Yeah, but suppose he took us up on it. Where would we be?
With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.
You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?
Clay Phillips.
That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.
It wasn't Clay's fault. We've been moving around most all the time -- mebbe when we get the ranch and stay in one place I can learn my letters then --
Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?
Well, Steve?
She was only teasin'.
For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up. I'm getting to the point where I don't think there's any place named Sonora.
No, I won't let you do it.
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
Thanks.
Oh my God! We're dead!
It's coming!
Hello Brenda.
Shhh... It's okay.
So, I guess I can go now.
Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.
He's right. I should go first.
Hey, you left your book back there.
Hi Buddy.
That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me.
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
I know, but I've been thinking --
I don't want to be your friend like this anymore.
Hey, look out, a bee!
Hey, wanna' share a soda?
Okay, I get the point.
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
Where's Shorty?
Stop touching his brain!
Both of them?
What the hell are you doing?
Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there.  Nobody wants to go.
Father!
Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....
I'm sorry.
Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...
Yo! That jacket is tight.
Am I cool now?
That was a great idea, Shorty.
I got it!
I finished all the interviews.
Here you go, Professor.
Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned personality disorder. She seems guarded, but willing to do this.
That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
I have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. We want to be safe.
Professor!
Are those cameras all throughout the house?
I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly.
Not to worry. There's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.
I can do it myself.
Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do you use on it?
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
I'm so glad you're here.
It's okay. I understand.
Would you like to see the girl?
Yes.
Remember, don't ask her too many questions.
Father, I think you should rest.
Aww, man. You just need to chill out. Come on, there's this party tonight it's gonna be fun. Lot's of alcohol and honeys.
Hi, Mom.
Did you hear?
...Jenner... Jenson, Emy Lou Jenson. 3511 Clark Avenue!
I wouldn't give ya a nickel.
Hi!
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that.
In here, Mom...
Get in, Mom! I have to open.
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
He goes to college with me!
You've been working in that video shop too long.
Home Sweet Home! Everything's fine, kids!
I can't stop thinking about that poor teacher.  Goodnight, honey. Don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow.
You bring me such peace...
Don't wake the kids...
Oooohhh! Yeah! Yeah!
Contusions... fractures... rupture of numerous vital organs...
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
You bitch!
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
What did you just say?
So you do drink?
Mr. Pickle! Did you see anybody in the booth next to you?
Ooohhhhhh! I made it all up! I never saw Beverly Sutphin in my life!
And who may I ask is Carl?
He killed people, Mom.
0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!
Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
I'll take this instead.
You know who I am, August?
I've been waitin' for you Miss Gibson. I want you to know I've decided to take your case.
That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
You can't tell.
You scared?
The acceptance of a secret is an obligation and in this case my dear, the obligation carried with it the necessity of dying if one betrayed that secret. You understand that don't you?
 I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
I'll give you a check.
About forty-five dollars.
What did she want to know?
The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.
But I'd give a great deal to know.
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
But I understand her. That may be more important.
Let her know what?
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
I don't know.
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
My window - - through which I see the world.
I thought your coming up here to the third floor to see me —-that it was your advent into my world. It turns out to be good-by. Why?
I had begun to write again -—that's whet I was doing when you came in.
He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
I hate people who try to peddle comfort. But,Mary, you shouldn't mourn for Jacqueline. Life for her was full of the agony of a disordered mind. It's better this way.
Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules.  When did you say you wanted them?
See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.
Following me to find Jacqueline?
This is curious, Jason. Half the time you talk as if Shakespeare were not fit to tie your shoe—laces; now this sudden humility.
Tell me where Jacqueline is -— we've got to find her.
If you like, I'll go with you to dinner.
Don't be so amazed. It's a very ordinary matter. I'm Jacqueline's physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.
Are we?	I thought I was very gay.
Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...
I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.
I have no intention whatsoever of hinting. Your sister, Mary, is a murderess. She killed Irving August -- stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.
But she was here?
But, Mrs. Lowood, I can't just stay here not knowing what's happened to my sister. Maybe if I went to New York -- if I saw Mrs. Redi myself --
Is it fifteen minutes yet?
Sorry. I'm nervous. This is very trying for me.
Yes.
No, I think you look... fine.
Well...
Oh, uh-huh.
Would you mind?
So what about kids?
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
You're what?
Of course not.
Are you in the middle of something?
What are these?
Yes.
This is just... so...
I'm not sure why I came here. I had kind of decided not to talk to you after... you know.
John and Cynthia have been... "fucking".
But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you.
I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.
Yes.
Yes. Whenever... all right, look. Whenever I see a man that I think is attractive, I wonder what it would be like with him, I mean, I'm just curious, I don't act on it, but I hate that I think that!! I wish I could just forget about that stuff!!
So you do fantasize?
If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean?
The problem was me. I was... I was a pathological liar. Or am, I should say. Lying is like alcoholism, one is always "recovering".
If you were in love with me, would you?
I can't.
You mean you're still in contact with her?
But you're planning to be?
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
I don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting --
You're not answering me.
Graham and I were talking about apartments and I told him to check the Garden District, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff.
I was just saying, you know? I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair.
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
I'm sorry, too. I... I get these ideas in my head, you know, and I have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios. And then I want to believe it so I don't think I've wasted the whole day. Last week I was convinced you were having an affair with Cynthia, I don't know why.
Loud.
Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?
Goddam right.
I have thought about it, yes.
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
Perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched.
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
Ann, in life one has to be aware of hidden agendas.  Did it occur to you that Graham may have his own reasons for not wanting you to be in therapy?
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
I don't know. He went to school here, then he was in New York for awhile, then Philadelphia, and then just kind of travelling around.
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
Questions about sex.
No, but I did.
Listen to you!! You sound like Mom. What are you talking about?
He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
Here it is.
Do you have my work number?
The extrovert.
No, I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused, I would say. And upset.
Well, they must be something sexual, because Ann gets freaked out by that shit. Are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something?
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
I am now recording. Tell me your name.
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
Was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
Then what happened?
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?
I have a friend coming in from out of town, I'll probably be spending some time with him the next couple of days.
You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?
Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.
Come on, John. You should be happy, we've gone this far without Ann finding out, I'm making it real easy on you. Just walk out of here and I'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime.
Who?
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
Plenty of room for two people.
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
Have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband?
May I ask who's calling?
Mr. Millaney?
...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
C'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your father'll never miss it.
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
Kiss, kiss?
Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?
Anything wrong?
Well? Supper at my place?
Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong? What's happened?
But where are you going?
Can I call you at the office?
Go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second-degree burns. It'll have to do for now.  What's your number? The number of your apartment?
Didn't seem worried about them.
So who changes?
Rog, I gotta talk serious to you. Really. Listen. Ya listening? OK. I want you to come into this with me. To tell the honest-to-God truth, I'm lonely.  All Hobbes ever did was run around getting money and phone me in the middle of the night. He wanted you in anyway. That's why we were gonna get together, the three of us. We would have enough to keep us going for at least five years, even with inflation.
But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?
Yes?
Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but you won't find any real meat in them.
OK, I bite. What does it look like?
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
Yeah? What do I do then?
GOT MY HEM SO HIGH THEY'LL SAY I'M BEING CHEEKY
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
BREAKING OUT
Check.  The quacks are willing tools?
Of course, Mrs. Majors -- Janet -- But I'm puzzled.  If she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract?
We're the experts.
Did you /hear/ that, Oliver.
Oh, Oliver.  What are we going to do?
I'm not going, Janet.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY
YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  Is this true?
They call it a new look at an old favourite I copied it from the 'Window on the World' show.  The Far East meets the Mid-West!
Poor Brad.
You shouldn't have said that.
Hey!  What are you trying to do?  Get yourself committed?
I NEED SOME
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
F for...
Our speciality.
HE!!??  How dare this person take advantage of my weakness.
That's an extremely negative response.
This is the nerve center of operations, Janet.  You must stay here tonight.  That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.
I FEEL THE HEAT FROM YOUR SKIN AND THE STUBBLE ON YOUR CHIN YOU'RE NO GOOD
YOU'VE GOT DIRT ON YOUR HANDS AND EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS YOU'RE NO GOOD
WHAT A JOKE...
THAT MINIMAL
So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...
THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE
Isn't she lovely?
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
So what's up?
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
My condolences.
They're from both of us.
Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago.
Two years ago, buddy.
You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
I'm thinking about the duck breast.
Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
Why did you tell them my book was being published?
What?
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
That's your problem, Miles.
Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.
You know, you could work in a wine store.
No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
Have you no shame?
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
So what should I wear?
Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
Pull yourself together, man.
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
What'd Christine say?
Where is Stephanie?
I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
What is it?
Just don't give up on Maya. Cool smart chicks like that --they like persistence.
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
How about this one? We didn't hit this one.
Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
So how did Stephanie know it was Saturday? We didn't get into that with Gary.
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
You know what I'm thinking?
I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type.
She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
We gotta go back.
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
So what the fuck were you thinking?
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
So what's the plan?
Me?
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
Nice. Very nice.
Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.
You got kids?
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
Bathroom over there?
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
Victoria! How the hell are you?
That was big of him.
That's great.
Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
How much skin and stem contact?
So what do you think?
That was fun last night.
So what are you up to today, Miles?
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
You talked to Wendy?
Miles, when are you going to get married again?
There's dust in it.
It's not contaminated. It's just tap water. Pour it in his bowl.
I'm scared.
Five. The five longest.
Explain noises.
It was very dark.
They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.  They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion.
Should we turn off the lights?
That's good enough for me.
It's still making the noises. It's broken.
Morgan?
It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development. It says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
Dad.
Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
You said something was strange. What's strange?
What about them?
Second thing this week I can't explain.
You can't describe him at all? Don't you think that's find of odd?
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.
I wouldn't do that. You're going to need every gun when that posse gets here.
So I did, I got out of there, I don't want no trouble. You know me.  So I walked out on the street and the fella tried to shoot me in the back.
Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend opened up on me.
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
Emmett.
Forget it.
McKendrick's men got him.
More than enough.
The Parkers seem like nice folks.
We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.  He said he'd... look into it.  I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns.
Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye?
You're not Baxter?
Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends.
I want you out of town before the hanging.
Offend anybody lately?
I gotta be going.
They got a saloon there?
Doesn't look quite fair.
I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
Where you been?
I'll see you around.
A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.
Because they don't like what I want.
J.T.'s done everything he can. I married a brave man. Augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking.  McKendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so J.T. can't even get the law enforced.
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
Where's your brother?
Kelly, get over here.  You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you?  Kelly, meet my friend Paden.
The jury saw it differently.
Rae, all we got is each other.
Get out. We have nothing to talk about.
This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.
I got there just short of too late.
Yeah, it's working out real good.
What is it you want from me?
Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
Is this a fair mix?
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
-- It's called a projector.
You're not renewing my contract.
They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.
Why isn't she with you?
Viktor, it's my studio.
Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity..."
Well, something has to be done about this budget.  It's completely unrealistic.  You allowed nothing for limousine service.
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.
I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.
Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
The premiere was the first time I've convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares.
Are you and Simone...  ... getting married?
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
... Simone.
Elaine, it's Wednesday.
Is Simone back to earth yet?
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?
Oh, Viktor.  You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this.  But in the morning, you'd go back to her.  What man wouldn't?
But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
Where are you?
I know it's embarrassing to admit it, mom, but when I think about it -- honestly, I haven't.  I mean, it feels like I have.  I know more about her than members of my own family.  She's even in my dreams. But I realized, going back through my diary, they were all TV appearances, near misses at parties, second-hand rumor, gossip on the internet.  I've never actually seen Simone up close, touched her, been in her physical presence.  Have you?
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
Because, you have to understand, Frank, these interviews -- none of this is real.  Who I am on screen and who I really am are two totally different people.
With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time.  Viktor bought me that time.  I owe him so much.
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
-- Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky... thank God.  I've been trying to see you, calling -- Your assistant wouldn't put me through.  I told her it was a matter of life and death.  I was afraid I wouldn't get to you in time --
It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
You already do.  But my actor won't get old, fat, lazy or drunk -- won't throw tantrums, demand a body double, script changes or a bigger trailer.  The Disney Corporation has been using artificial actors for years.
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart.  It's important.
Your mother couldn't make it?
Not quite how I imagined it --
Me too.
Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?
You know me -- married to my work.
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake.
Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
A lot's happened since we last saw each other.
No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
Simone, are you there?
Let's take it down a notch.
See beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood. -- See that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake, the scales have tipped in favor of the fake.  -- See that if the performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor is real.  Once a performance is committed to film, the blood and bones are gone anyway.  Only the spirit, the illusion remains. Besides, what's real anymore? These days most actors have digital work done to them so it's a gray area.
The only real truth is in the work.
Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.
Do you know how important this is? This is big time.  I'm going to read it for you, doctor.
Wow. They called you their son.
Are you calling me?
On my way to the flea market in Amish country. Thought maybe you want to come. Show me how to buy at these things.
You know that's probably not the best idea. I'll just wait to see them in the store.
Your eye frames. They don't seem to have any lenses in them.
What were they hiding from?
Private Kinney's wife is really sick -- she has something called a brain anism.
Know what?
Dead people, like in graves and coffins?
Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
When they get mad, it gets cold.
You weren't a paper champion.
Dr. Crowe?
What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?
I wish I were somewhere else.
And you know what else?
What are you thinking, Momma?
I'd give anything to have been there.
You can see her?
Where is she?
Cole, this was a legal courthouse. Laws were passed here. Some of the first laws of this country. This building was full of lawyers. Lawmakers.
Excuse me?
...He doesn't get invited places.
I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school.
I happen to be a professional.
Suzie???
Looks like the alternator.
AAAAAAAAAAAA --
Motherfucking soundman! I couldn't hear myself sing!
Hey. Fuck you.
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
Damn! These are one hundred dollar Nikes!
I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  Wasn't much right before that, neither.
-- And keep your eyes on the road.
Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.
Down boy.
You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
Yes!
You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break.
How does it feel, Keith?
My father and I don't exactly see eye to eye.
Name something.
We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?
Suzie --
No --
No Mac, please... I --
Hey. Anyone here need lessons, just talk to me.
Hold it, hold it. Aren't you forgetting something, Rod?
Where's Mac?
Carl.
Bill, this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
Sorry.
What you up to?
How about Brenda?
Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
No reception out here.
We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
Where are you?!
Surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long.
What?
Looks like a chipmunk.
Hey there, Chief.
Megan Halesy' little sister.
Where's the old half--Mexican?
Grant? Grant, I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.
Meat.
Sure thing, killer.
He's teaching environmental science, Grant. Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.
Where are you going?
That's not true -- Where are you--?
You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck.
Get your hands off my daughter!
What's he get if he wins here?
I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
You got my barley pop?
Okay. I was in Texas dancing in an industrial show for Sunkist Oranges. They say I'm the new Anita Bryant. But I'm really a dancer from New York. A lot of credits. Moderate talent.  Anyway, after opening night, I was walking back to the motor lodge and suddenly there he was. A tall Texan with a twenty-nine inch waist. Pure dynamite.
Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
Why're you driving so fast?
Is this fun?
You have a great profile.
You know, my mother was a dancer, too. Her big shot was the touring company of 'Brigadoon.' She's been married three times. To a redneck, a poet and her tennis instructor.  See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous. I was nervous when I first got into the car. Now I'm scared shitless.
Jesus!!!
Mississippi's the other way!
-- You know, I used to be a high fashion model. Tried it for six months and almost freaked. Makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds...
My very words.
What kind of a guy is he?
What are you gonna do when you get home?
One to five?
Well, at least it hasn't been boring.
Why should I?
Order up!
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
What are you doin' now?
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
Bandit?
Loud and clear.
Hit the brakes!
Let's get the hell outta here.
Bandit I, do you copy?
This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?
I hope that's you, buddy; 'cause I'd hate to start believing in ghosts.
-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.
-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line.
Breaker. Breaker.
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
I think you're just yellow.
Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
Five thou.
-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
Is your security team armed?
Anything on the Swede?
Maybe he's that good. Never been caught, no criminal record.
Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall- to-wall major felony offenses, murder, extortion, arson, grand larceny --  -- A paternity suit... I just feel like we're playing catch-up with all this and we shouldn't be.
But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?
He's giving them up?
Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
No.
Yeah, ye-- I -- uh, there were, earlier, there was that guy Carrut--
This man wearing the jacket identified himself as an Federal agent?
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
But there were more of you?
Really?
About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
So I guess you're not going.
I know his location, we've got the drop of a maybe half a day before that location gets grape-vined and the rest of the world gets hipped.
Two security levels, the one we're going in under the guise of, hotel security, has restricted access. They're mostly there to monitor the lobby, handle disturbances on the different floors and toss out drunks.  There's a thirty-five member employee rotation going from graveyard to day shift. If we split up, we can blend in and enter unnoticed. Once we're inside the hotel, we'll regroup.
...I'm sorry...
Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!
Y'ain't never had to wash another man's blood off, dig it out y'fingernails... Y'had us for that. Y'ain't ever made a real beef on y'own, shit as light in the ass as you are, I'll bet you ain't ever made anything more than a fuck'n fist your whole life.  So if you think I'mma let your lil' punk-ass, with the dirt I've done for you, in the eleventh hour, sell me off like some fucking field nigger, hand me up to the Feds like y'last chip, then you done gone straight out-your-motherfucking MIND!
They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off!
Baby, I've been co-habitating with these people for the past thirty odd hours and in so doing, have stared into the face of hell. These are the premier prick cocksuckers of all time and I feel beaten by them, I feel bloodied --
You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
...holy shit... that's Heller...  Isn't it?
I wouldn't go that far.
You're trying to save Sparazza?
You got clicks, anything?
Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
No shit.
So how we lookin'?
-- never in a million girl --
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
For real?
That takes some of the sting out.
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
...So you heard from Keith? He still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl?
He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
Girl, lemme ask you somethin' and I want you t'tell me straight up, since I got my suspicions and y'know I ain't one t'talk circles... you gay?
Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
...Shhhhhhit... girl, there's these two dudes, just sittin' here in this elevator, all shot up...
They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
What else did Padiche say?
You have to give me your word you won't come in.  Then I'll come out.
I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?
What's wrong?  What happened to Gibarian?
How much sleep do you need?
Personally, I think it's God.  At least, it fits my definition.
What will you say?
What are you going to report back to Earth?
You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that --
Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable, how you equivocate!  You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen!  This is happening, Kelvin.  Wake up.
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
Perhaps it did.
You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you.  She will die.  Then what will you do?
What are they?
We're taking a flight?
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
You go home.
What do you remember?
Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
What does Snow think you should do?
What's wrong.
What are you talking about?
Do you want to stay here?
Chris --
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
Is that really what you want?
I think they help.
We thought you'd be alone.  We want to talk about...
Claire!
Skiddy and Kit?  I haven't seen them since that shitty pasta dinner on the cape.
Do you have another tie?  Something more conservative?
What did he say?
Would you pick one out, please?
I'm sorry about what happened.
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?
Good night, Mike.
Yeah.
You told her?
Claire...
What a memory.
... Mike.
Everyone's all right...?
So.
You still going away?
I like your coat.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
... You know, and I know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial...
Mike?
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
So how'd it go?
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
She took you shopping for a tie?
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
Coming to bed?
What did you watch?
My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take?
I'm going to visit my sister for a few days.  I'd like you to get your stuff out.
Even Joey Venza?!
You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.
Bullshit!  Prove it.
I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.
Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table!
Except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere!  I'd like to kill the guy who invented those things.
What "plans?"  You and Mom got "plans?"
She's what?
What!  What kind of pathetic line is that?
Lizzy!
You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
Yeah--
I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
Thank you.  Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.
Oh, that?  It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest.  Bye.
What's this? A cockaroach?
Eh.  Week from tomorrow.
Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
I hate the Platonic idea of you.
My my.
God, Flash can be such a jerk.
Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash."
Brrr.  It's colder than New Hampshire in here.
-- but at least Aunt May's okay now. I really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.
Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
I... I like you.  A lot.
This may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know.
Yeah, Roz.
The record--
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
In this obsolete little cyclotron, I'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th Century.  With more power, I could--
That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.
Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering… the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron…
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
So they're airing this tonight?
I asked if you felt like a drink--
I sent for  the police.  We can explain.
I see.  Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad.
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
Up here, Docky Ocky!
Jawohl.
Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.
What's the match gag?
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.
If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy? Or Security?
Private property, bub.
Nice guy! The Krauts shoot Manfredi and Johnson last night and today he's out trading with them.
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.
Next we're going to auction off your department store -- and your stable.
Break it off!
Maybe he would. We applied for Officers' Training together, remember? They turned me down, but I'm glad to see you made it. Of course, it couldn't be that all that dough behind you had something to do with it!  His mother's got twenty million dollars.
What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.
You won't get off that cheap.
There will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin. You will be interrogated by the General Staff. When you come to the part about your arrest, I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit.
What do you do for heat in this barrack? No stove?
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
Jawohl.
Good morning, Animal! What'll it be for breakfast? Scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny- side up? Griddle cakes? A waffle?
I'll kill you, Harry -- so help me!
Look at me! I'm your baby!  Get a load of that blonde one! Built like a brick Kremlin!
Animal! When the war's over, remember I told you I'd fix you up with Betty Grable!
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
Look at her! Isn't she beautiful! Married an orchestra leader!
Hey! This is with a typewriter! It's from a finance company!
Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
I'll open mine now.
Why the south latrine?
You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.
Anybody call?
If you can't get the BBC, how about getting Guy Lombardo?
What's the matter, boys? Is my slip showing?
What happened, Cookie? Who did it?
Right.
Pirelli. Coleman. Agnew. Shapiro.
Shapiro. Shapiro.
Now you've done it. You've given me nervous indigestion.  Anything else bothering you, boys?
Or how about a game of pinochle? No, you're not a pinochle man. You're a chess player.  I haven't played since I was a kid. Let's see --  -- a pawn moves this way, doesn't it? And a bishop this way? And the queen -- every which way, doesn't it?
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
December seventh, forty-one.
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
We have no radio.
No use, Schulz. You might as well come clean. Why don't you just tell 'em it's me. Because I'm really the illegitimate son of Hitler. And after the Germans win the war you'll make me the Gauleiter of Zinzinnati.
Du lieber Gott! How do you look? You had a fight?
Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village --
Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
I do not want those cigarettes.
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
This is me in Cincinnati.
Where is he now?
Captain=8A
But that wasn't so long ago. It couldn't have been more than...
According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years
What do you mean?
Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-
He can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him.  Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?
That's where he's going.
Are any of them inhabited?
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
Really? What do you feel?
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
Looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while. How do you feel?
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
You did it, Kirk!  Damage report, Ensign.
Guinan. It's important that you tell me what you know. We think Soran's developed a weapon...a terrible weapon. It might give him enough power to-
It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me.  I knew things about people, about events, about time.
Can I?
I don't understand.
So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?
You said history considers me dead. Who am I to argue with history?
I'm not going  Scotty, help me with this chute.
Their life signs are are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum.
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
Sir?
I always thought I'd have a crack at this chair one day.
I'm afraid I can't just leave it at that. The commanding officer of this ship is clearly distraught about something. As ship's counselor, it's my duty to-
Doctor, we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. Until then-
The Nexus.
Sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago.
As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.
Enterprise maintaining full impulse power...
Transwarp at your command, Sir!
Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning...  I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!
Unit two, this is One. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge.
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge.
Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
Could it be Spock's?
Why don't we beam it up?
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
As before... Metallic mass... Verifying triminium photon tube... No new data.
There <u>shouldn't</u> be any. Only plant forms were built into the Genesis matrix.
Saavik to Grissom. Request computer study of soil samples for geological aging.
Well. There's your life form reading. These were microbes on the tube's surface. We shot them here from Enterprise.  They were fruitful, and multiplied.
It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
Why?
The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now...
Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
Captain, this is Saavik. We have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate.
Ah, Saavik, that's, ah, extroadinary. What would you, ah, like to do next?
Mr. Scott...
Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems --
What's wrong?
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
I know you... Do I not?
Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu...
Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey?
Close... There --
If I read this right, sir, we have full power.
The planet Vulcan. In hailing distance, sir.
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise --
Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules!
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
David?... David!
Wait! Give me a chance --
There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too?  Surrender your vessel!
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
Then, how --
He asked you not to grieve...
What about Spock?
So!  Speak!
1,000 Kellicams, closing!
500 Kellicams!
Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
But dear Lord, are we intelligent enough to -- Suppose, this thing were used where life already exists?
Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?
I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon --
Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.
Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
Say thank you.
Shore leave, Admiral.
They even killed the galley chief.
Now that's what I call a meal.
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
Jim... read me? Can you read me?
David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy.
It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...
Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
Will you please be quiet! We must have order here.  This has to be some sort of mistake.
David --
This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
But the child --
I don't mean to intrude.
Not like this -- no. I haven't faced death, I cheated death. I tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. I know nothing.
Don't you believe it.
They're requesting visual communications, sir.
At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE! Why can't you?
No!
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
Scotty -- what's left?
Mr. Scott on discrete.
On screen.
And who is this?
Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?
Is the word given?
They destroyed the simulator room and you with it.
There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond.
Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
That's it?
Admiral, they're reducing speed.
Sporadic energy readings port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn.
Spock!
Any suggestions, Admiral?
And why not?
How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
May I speak, sir?
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
That was a little joke.
On screen...
It doesn't make sense. These coordinates are well within Regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless.
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
Hold your course. Look sharp...
I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
Yes, well, why don't you show him around and...
I can't get power, sir!
Admiral on the bridge --
We are clear and free to navigate.
Fire all phasers...!
As you wish, since you deem them of value. But I cannot wait here to find them.
I would accept that as an axiom.
You -- sent them away. Without even letting me say goodbye?
Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix-up Would you believe I was never told about your visit?
You'd think they could at least send a ship. Bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this Klingon flea trap...
Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
It doesn't look all that different.
He's coming 'round, Jim...
Hi... Busy?
Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
You're joking...!
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
Naturally.  So what is your problem?
... I don't think he understands...
... It gives me a great sense of history.
How long?
The top of what?
I do not know your name.
Go ahead. Stun me.
Operational, Admiral. Cloaking Device now available in all modes of flight.
No choice now, Scotty!
Yes, sir.
"Neutralized?" How?
Attempting the hell to communicate.
He's harmless.  Back in the sixties he was part of the Free Speech movement at Berkeley. I think he did too much LDS.
Iowa.
Or believe, I'll bet.
Just a little joke. See you later, old friend.
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
Where could you take them?
Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
It's true... what you said...
Oh my God, we're too late!
Hey! -- Where you going?!
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
There is a 20th Century possibility.
I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins....
Spock...
You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
You've done it before. Can't you remember?
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
Spock: Condition report!
You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>.  Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?!  Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.
Warp two... three...
What is our condition?
Aye, sir. Descending.
Systems report.  Communications?
What is it?
Then, this is what it would sound like underwater?
I'll have bearing and distance for you, sir.
We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?
I can't, sir -- Nothing!
Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
Scotty, we have to find some Humpbacks.
What is it? I thought I told you never to call me --
I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie...
Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve...
Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?  
Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto moosareruka na.  Wait my son. What is your name?
My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive.
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?
Don't panic...
There are days.
When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...
But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.
Really.
But you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time... or bedtimes... or having to eat food you don't like...
Do machines ever play?
Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.
Won't he rust?
To many offlanders, what you have here would be more valuable than gold-pressed latinum.  And I'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you.
Will he live?
A ship,
Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?
It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.
That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
There are six hundred people down there. We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.  The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings...
On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
Gallatin! So the righteous Starfleet Captain finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface?
The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain.
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
Implants bothering you?
Full impulse.
That's your expert opinion?
Aye, sir. Highly volatile...I recommend we keep our distance...
We're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range, sir.
They need us to mediate some territorial dispute...
Who is it?
Prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours.
Would you like something to eat?
I... I must have slept through my alarm. I'm on my way...
Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out...
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?
Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...?
The Ba'ku could use some rest, sir. According to the geo-scan, this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers...
Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...
You haven't done that in a long time...
It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating...
Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?
What are we waiting for? Let's go.
There must be some good people... even in this time.
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
You think they're still up there?
Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
Is it Japanese?
Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie.
I've deactivated the sensory inputs. That flesh on your body is just meat, now.
Dispersive armor is holding.
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
Data... are you sure you're all right?
"APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?
Juice?
Ready to make a little history?
There's no temporal shielding in here! We're starting to pick up relativistic effects!
ATR setting...
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
There is no invasion...
Take care of him. He's a very special man.
What?
I'd say you already have.
Signal the Endeavor to fall back. We'll cover them.
Incoming transmission from the Borg.
Captain...?
Port battery, ready sir!
Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes.
Yes, sir. But Captain... are we... all going back?
I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success.
They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
Report.
They're bypassing Engineering...
I have to admit there was a moment there when --
Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room.
Worf? Is something wrong?
Spock, that was actually funny.
Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete...
Pity they're retiring us just as I was starting to understand you, Spock...
Or not to be -
What the Hell's going on?
No!
That was the general idea I intended to convey.
Specifically of...?
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
ARE YOU CRAZY?
We're explorers not diplomats!
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
Would you care to go topside?
He's a DOCTOR!
Spoken by you?
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
You were demoted...
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
As Captain I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
Where is Mr. Sulu?
Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --
Shields. Battle stations.
Mr. Chekov, take us forward, thrusters only, one half impulse power...
They're preparing to fire.
Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe's deep in Klingon territory. If we're discovered...
You must have cursed yourself, for having programmed our data banks, Lieutenant. Only they revealed something wrong aboard Enterprise.
This is KRONOS One. I am Chancellor Gorkon.
Thank you, Captain.
Chancellor, may I present Commander Spock, whom I believe you know, Dr. Leonard McCoy, chief medical officer, Montgomery Scott, chief engineer...
Thank you, Captain Kirk. The evening has been most... edifying.
We don't get many presidential assassins.
That's not his knee.  Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
I know how to get outside the shield.
Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed...
Stand down your weapons.
Aye, sir.
Sorry -
Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...
Who is "US?"
Just the prototype.
Spock, I'm really tired...
What the -
I am responsible for involving you in this. I will go.
But we haven't run out of history just yet.  Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - "the undiscovered country"...
Gorkon's own man??
You must have faith.
Very well. For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
Sir?
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
They don't place the same value on life that we do, Spock - you know that... take my word: she didn't shed one bloody tear...
Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...
A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked!
They're naturally wary, ma'am. We've been at war a long time.
Do you know who I am?
No. I must deactivate you.
He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.
To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochran’s own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
So... To happy endings.
That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
The final signature is approx- imately 300 meters up that incline.
Data to Captain Picard. Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And, I believe, we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage.
How long until we reach the fleet?
We are being hailed.
Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself, it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.
I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
How can you be certain?
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
What's he doing?
You have the bridge, Commander. Use all available power to move away from the Scimitar.  Now, Mister La Forge.
Sir, we're being hailed.
Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.
With or without the rest of the fleet?

Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
So, human... you've met your better self!
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
Sir --
It's working.
Not very chatty.
I am, Commander Riker...  May I touch your hair?
It's not quite the face you remember.
For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals.
Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... you’d be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would.
Were we always explorers?
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.
In time, Jean Luc.
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
Not so long.
Yes.
It’s too late.
My God...
Intruder alert!
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.
I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
Right in line with that burning tree.
Benny, there's nothing there.
We're only going to be here a few hours...
Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
What was your last stop?
We're going... Damn!  We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin?
Contain it and get back to me.
Then it's not an accident that they found us.
Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
Why did you let it get into a populated area?
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
No deal.
I just retired.
I won't let anyone hurt you.
This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?
Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.
Please...
What?
What?
What?
No gas.
No gas.
Who?
What's the matter?
Horses.
What?
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
Then let me go. You don't need me.
Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'...
Goodbye.
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
You thought we were a different planet?!
The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
I will go. But not you.
Good morning.
You don't forget anything, do you?
Oh, you're pretty...
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
May I have twenty-five cents, please?
This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
This is yours...
Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
I'm sure we could find a country and western station.
I love you.
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
Help me!!!
Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...
The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way.
Wait. Could I have your autograph?
This is crazy. What were we going to do if that had been the ship? We have two thirty calibre machine guns, three M16's and some handguns.
Can you see under the faceplate?
After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive.
Oh, Jesus.
Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.
Where are you going?
Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?
I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
I told you...
Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?
Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
You said you were going to get her out of this.
He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head.
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
Cut it out, Tran.
I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
You have to go.  I mean it.
That's a good one, coming from you.
You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there.
Who did it?
What's going on?
How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
What kind of things exactly?
Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?
You see the look on that preppy puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.
You should feel like shit.
But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
Whattya mean?
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?
No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
Whoa.  That is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.
Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all...
I always do.
About what?
Charm.
Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
Are we having a bad night?
Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is Armani.  You angry?
That would be no.
So am I.  Just trying to get by.
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.
Is this great fabric or what?
No it doesn't.
Where we going?
This is bad.
He's totally cut off from the outer world.
Okay, we gotta get over there.  Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
You see Tran?
Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?
Hey, Lenny.  We made it.
Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.
Was this him?
No.
Welcome back, sir. How was the vacation?
Anybody talk to the press?
You run the plates?
You tell me.
Hi there.
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.
Yeah.
Look...
Calm down, Harold.  Okay, here's what we're going to do, Harold: there's a pull off up ahead, we're going to stop there.
I've been looking for you.
What did he look like?
Nada. Vague description, that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car, the diner: no fingerprints, no trace evidence.
Chuck, hello.  This is Agent Kulok. She has a background in medical forensics.
We didn't know Speck was a serial, the police didn't know, his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?
We have another one.
You refused to comply with a direct order.
The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
Agent Mackelway, you're going to get your wish. You're going back to Washington. I want you back in Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat rooms.
I'm hesitant to...
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
I suspected, but you were the one Low contacted. That's why I brought you back here.
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
Watch out for Dick Low, he's a liar; he has his own world. There was a Junior Agent in Seattle, not unlike you, an Agent who fell under Dick's spell. He'd have done anything for Agent Low. Richard got this Agent to take a suspect to the crime scene, beat him up, force a confession -- all unauthorized, all illegal.  The Agent died that night, killed by the suspect. Richard Low got him killed. Worst of all, we had to hush it up, let the suspect go. The suspect was George Sheldon, the second man Richard killed.
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
Miss me, Dave?
Don't you touch him.
Agent Kulok, that boy, as we speak, is in Hawkins' truck, probably still alive, in a dark refrigerated compartment, shivering in just a T- shirt: put yourself in his mind, freezing, terrified, wanting his mother. Put yourself in his mother's place, desperate, imagining the worst is happening as she pleads, back there at the rest stop, for someone, anyone, to listen to her. This is not hypothetical, this is real. It is happening now and you can do something about it.
Why did he come out here? What's going on?
This is a sexy case.
What about the chat rooms themselves?
No, no, no, most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists, guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room, listened in, I started to think some might actually be real, that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler.
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
Taking a Stryker saw, cutting off the top of someone's cranium, pulling the brain out -- what's that, a day in Spring?
I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
When you were his student? Did he come on to you?
It's a no-no.
Jesus.
You mean --
Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.
I met with Richard Low.  These are names of missing persons he has flagged. I'm double-checking every case, but I don't want to be too obvious about it. I marked the ones I'd like you to work on.
You were right. He found me.
You're putting me in a difficult position.
But why this pattern?
What happened?
Agent...
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
How's the arm?
He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
Was it Zero?
[Reality very risky.]
If I owe, I will go.
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
I want to go live with you.
Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.
I believe it's in my file, sir.
Koessler?
I don't think you understand.
You've been through worse.
Thanks.
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
Well, thank you...?
I like quiche.
Well, I left someone very special behind.
They're out of Glenlivet.
I know what you're saying, man. I don't know what to tell you...
No... no... The worst was when I went in for this After-School special and I'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. I see they're all signed in for the same role as me...
It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four.
What do you guys do?
Huh?
Do you have anything smaller?
Already? You poor thing. It won't last.
It's a rebound.
I'll have to come see you sometime.
Can I give you a ride to your car...?
...Which one...?
Hi. Sorry about that.
Good.  I think about things.
Yeah.
You know, us.
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
I miss you, Mike.
I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.
So I don't call either way.
So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
There's the rub.
I don't think I'm gonna take it.
I mean, I need the money.
It's definitely a step back for me.
How many strokes?
Kinda money, huh?
Darwinism at its best.
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
I'm going in. Will you be my wing- man?
Uuuuugh!
What's dumb about it?
They turned you down?
See, it's all how you look at it. If your life sucks, then mine is God awful. I mean, I moved out here partially because I saw how well you were doing. You got in the union, you got an agent. I thought if you could make it, maybe I could too...
Then why won't she call...?
You miss the pain?
You should play another team. The Kings are bitches in this game.
It's kinda money, actually.
Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
Tonight, baby.
I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
I took out three hundred, but I'm only gonna bet with one. I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night. You gotta be cool though.
This place is dead. I thought this was the city that never sleeps.
Cut that shit out.
The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.
That's where we make our scene.
Always, baby.
Mikey's the big winner.
What an asshole.
I can't believe what an asshole you are.
Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.
That was so fuckin' money. It was like that "Jedi mind" shit.
Whatever.
Sorry about interrupting...
I don't think so.
That was different.
...a day...
Was I money?
I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something.
Is he cute? Ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail!
What a surprise...
Now?
Baby, don't talk that way, baby...
...and big fuckin' teeth...
...You're just poking at it...
You're money.
Definitely. Two days. That's the industry standard...
...Oh, who would jack your fuckin K- car? He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat.
...Sue...
It's on...
Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.
Be my friend.
Godfather.
You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people.  That little farce you played out with my sister.  Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone?
What was that?
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
You take care of Paulie?
Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.
I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...
You think we'll go for that last place?
You take care of your family?
This morning.
When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
Tom, I never thought you were a bad Consigliere, I thought Santino a bad Don, rest in peace.  He had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune.  Michael has all my confidence, as you do.  For reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen.
Have you thought about a wife?  A family?
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
I know.
Corleone.
I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
Hey America!  Is she as rich as they say?
You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight. 
I know about what you mean!
The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
Jesus, I don't know...
The Don was slipping; in the old days I could never have gotten to him.  Now he's dead, nothing can bring him back.  Talk to Sonny, talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio...it's good business.
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?
Bookkeepers know everything. Rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing.  They get a little more money than the job's worth.  Lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly.
Hello.  Kay?
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.
Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.
Where are you going?
Mikey, you look beautiful!
Go on Mike.
O.K.  How long do you think before I can come back?
Do you renounce Satan.
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
Let us fill up our Regimes.
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
The Corleone family wants to buy me out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy me out.
I think so.  Detective squad?
Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing.
Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
I had to promise, capital P, never to take it off -- otherwise I'd give it to you.
He's drowning me!
Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.
Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true?
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient. 
Without the glasses you're not even ugly.  I don't need them because I never read. How do I look.
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.
Freddie?
He's downstairs.
What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life.
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
I've got plans!
Esatto. I'm always planning.
Then I'll take it as a compliment.
You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me.
What?
The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious --
This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.
Who is it?
Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.
Could you ever conceive of going to Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home?  I'd pay you. I'd pay you 1000 dollars.
I'm well, thank you.
Marge has been telling us about the rings.
Dickie, you can't even drive a car! No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life.
You really should go in, it's marvelous.
Tell me, why is it when men play they always play at killing each other...? I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.
Dickie!
He hates being confronted.
Oh my God. Tom.
What?
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
I was looking forward to seeing him.
Very.
Tom?
I found Dickie's rings.
Marge? Where are you going?
I told you. He gave them to me.
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
Where's Dickie's father?
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
Which is?
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --
C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the two of us.
Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore Roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
Ditto.
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
Welcome to Venice. This place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it? Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day.
You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --
He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?
But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...
I keep wanting to do that -- fling open the door -- let the light in, clean everything out. If I could get a huge eraser and rub everything out... starting with myself... the thing is, Peter, if...
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.
You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back.  You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.
Was that Meredith?
Good things about Tom Ripley? Could take some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is tender... Tom is beautiful...
It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday?
Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.
Even her.
Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago.
It is a little coarse, yes.
Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
You're right! Now I remember! It was after the Western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late. The next day I was completely bushed. It was unbelievable.
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
You must be rich.
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". 
You didn't have to spend your money -- ?
This is sort of high class...
Well... mostly...
What about the record?
Hello, Travis.
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
No, why?
Try holding the match like this.
He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --
He's Black, OK?
First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
What is your name? My name is Travis.
No, I'm serious, really...
First she did her make-up. You know, I hate it when they do that. I mean she does the whole works, the mascara, the eye-shadow, the lipstick, the rouge...
Fuckin' One-Ball.
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
Stick up?
I don't remember.
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
Listen...
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
...and after that Sport and I just started hanging out...
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane -- that's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or busted. I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went. I stayed here.
How?
You're not much with girls, are you?
Do you really think I should go to the commune?
There must be something...
Got your license?
So why do you want to be a taxi driver?
There's porno theatres for that.
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
No, I want long shifts.
I'm here to see Iris.
Get it.
Real down.
Yeah.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Don't stop...  do no stop.
Thank you.
What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.
Well yes I suppose ...
I'll go.
What, vou?
Mason.  Mason?
Mason, uhm, John, I have something to tell you.  You know that pardon= contract you signed?
I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.
Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you.  You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning.
Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you.  This is me, Delly.  Pete Appleton. And I love you!
Dad?
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
What.
You can all go home, now.  He's not going anywhere.
Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
Do you have the...
Were we going to get married?
No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
What about a loan?  You could go to the bank...?
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
My what?
It never used to be.  You were two left feet on the dance floor.  Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.
What... do you remember?
Yes, sir.
Yes it does.
Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party?
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
I'm a little hesitant to say.
Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment.  I wonder if you're familiar with it.
Only one in town.  Get in, son.
Are you saying that he's...
Well, no, but these gentlemen would like to get some answers...
Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
And... what's my name again?
Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed?
"February 10, 1942.  Picture 'Ball of Fire.'"
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
Ha!
I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.
Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.
Been drinkin' a bit, have we?
Do you remember if you were driving a car?  Maybe you went over the bridge.  No guard rail there, it's easy to do.  It's happened before.
You smell gas?
Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place.  Now, I need a moment alone.
Take a hike.  Am-scray.
However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles.  Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.
Thank me publicly?  For what?  For ruining this woman's life?
Luke!  Luke, something's wrong! The film broke, and I can't raise Harry on the house phone!
Cat.  That's simple.  I like it.  Hi, Cat.
T-t-thank you.  Thank you.  I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army.  They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital.  I forget things sometimes.  Since the w-w-war.
What happened?
That you got let go.
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
Mr. Appleton, I have reason to believe you're holding something back, and that just rubs me the wrong way.  Sir, are you a communist?
Did you drive up from San Francisco?
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
Miss Daniels? Is that you?
Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
How do you like our little hamlet?
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
I did.
Yes.
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
Could I have a puff?
Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
No, it's Lois!
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
Do you know him?
Where does he live?
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
Are you sure?
Thank you.
What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad as birds.
Young woman cut herself.
We don't have any fog this time of year, Mitch.
Oh. I see.
Lovebirds, I see.
Seven o'clock, same as usual.
Whose side are you on?
But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...
Where will we go?
Mother! I'm trying my best!  I'm... trying... my...
They won't be.
Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?
If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
No.
Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.
I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
That's the last of it.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
These birds were...
He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him....
Well, where did he go?
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
I wonder if you could help me.
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
I didn't break that window!
Do you practice here?
To see a friend of mine.  Will you please be careful?
I'm sure.
And you didn't come up here to see her.
You were lying.
What did it say?
Why?
Do you expect me to believe...?
But not for me.
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's not a job, of course. I just take it because...
Do you know what I was doing in that shop?
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
Do you want some mustard with this?
Some cream?
What do you mean?
Melanie, Melanie...
No, no...
How long have they been gathering there?
You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
The power.
There we are!
No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?
How do you plan to do that?
How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?
Birds?
I'm Donald Fettes.
Even so, I could never think of going on -- I've got to find some other profession.
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --
Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.
He's not home.
There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.
Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
But you did promise.
Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
We can't be sure of that.
Here is where you must watch closely, gentleman -- closely -- it is the very heart of the matter --
What do you mean, Fettes?
Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
Tosh!  Fettes!  It's not their grief I'm worrying about -- I'm talking of our own end --
I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows.  We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.
Are you a doctor, too?
What you really want to ask me is about my back, isn't it -- about where it hurts?
Aye, but I still wonder how much.
I thought this was a school day.
He'll not leave the grave -- not since Wednesday last when we buried the lad.
I'm by way of being a medical myself.
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
I brought you something tonight, MacFarlane -- an interesting specimen -- in very good condition.
Surely you are not threatening an old friend, Toddy.
What I was going to say is this -- wouldn't you be more comfortable at Leith in a neat little house?
But why, Gray? Why?
I presume you shall.  This won't be my last visit here.
No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
But where did they get those people?
How long ago?
Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once.  But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
I'm sorry, Doctor.  Georgina's a good child -- a brave child -- you saw how she was during the operation -- but if she can't move, she can't move.
You're daft.  What's Gray to me. He's only a man from whom I buy what I need when I need it -- the rest is forgotten.
Fettes -- where is Fettes?
I was hoping you'd find out.
Where is it? This place?
That was a fucking hollow point!
Fuck! What do you want?
You killed her. I saw it.
One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.
What did they give you?
You're him! You're Corvis! We fried your ass. You're dead, man!
Fuck. Me.
You're him. Corvis.
I was a friend of your sister's.
Daisy. How did you know?
Are you ok?
No. You don't.
... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing.
It's ok, it's ok...
But you, you've had them.
Look, can I just call a cab?
You're in with them.
Sweetheart...
Tell me, Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?
You wrote this?
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?
The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake.  You mentioned a demonstration of force--
Maybe a little demonstration.
Tell me what?
Are you an FBI man?
You think they'll ever find him?
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
Did all these people die in wars?
I've got some money. My mother gave me two dollars.
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
Oh, I'd say forty-five.
The present situation?
I will make that recommendation to the President.  I must tell you in all honesty that I'm extremely dubious about the results.
Now that you understand the situation more clearly, perhaps you'd like to discuss the matter with the President
Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
Well, we could--
You know how I feel, Tom. I just want to think it over.
Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--
Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
Are you crazy? After what happened today?
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers.
Where are you going now?
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
"Klaatu barada nikto."
Hello.
I was.
Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
You sure about that?
No -- no, thanks.
People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
I don't like horror comics.
We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way.
Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet.
<u>I'll</u> have to drive!
Well... we blew Plan A.
We've been aware of some very serious vampire activity in this town for a long time.
Did you see that sucker burn?!
I'm my own man.
What is this, David?
Where you going?
With him?
You can't kill me, Star.
And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
This is just our cover.  We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
Bad breath?  Long fingernails?
What's that smell!?
I said, <u>I'll take you there</u>. Nobody's going near Star without me.
Smells good.  When do we eat?
... And stay outta here.
Hi... I'm Laddie.
You didn't tell David?
It's early.  Why do we have to go home?
See you later.
Okay?
-- If there's a girl, we could talk about her.
I <u>didn't</u> invite you in this time!
Ocean air!
Tell them to get something to eat.
He met a girl.
What's wrong?  Tell me.
Sam!  What happened!?  You had me scared to death.  Are you all right?
What did you say?
Ohmygod...
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
He doesn't walk all over me.
Something the matter?
How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
What's your name?
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
I guess you're new around here.
Ouch.
When?
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.
What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
Star.
Michael!  Get behind the wheel.
What's the matter?
Maybe dinner.
Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  Just anything at all?  Any little thing?
What was he doing in the rec room?
What the hell you looking at me like that for?
Sure.  You think there's a connection?
What?
I've changed my mind... I'd... I'd like to come back inside... I don't want to stay out here any more... Funny things... I hear funny things out here.
Fuchs...?  No, it's not Fuchs... You must let me back in... I won't harm anyone... I promise...
Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One?
Auxiliary light cables...?  Been cut.
We got to burn 'em.
Why didn't it imitate Fuchs?  Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits.
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
What's happening?
Torch it over there!
What are you doing?
You ain't tying me up.
I think so.
How many in their party?
Right.  Why not?
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
Couple seconds of an Argentine disco station.
We're on fire!
Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
Let's rush him.  He's not going to blow us all up.
What's...
Sanchez...?  Hey, who...
Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside...
Tie up Clark, too.
We've got to find Fuchs.  When we find him -- we kill him.
He might just wait us out.
Got Sanchez... World War Three wouldn't mess with this fucker... Can go through walls... And it's like all over the place...
It's got into the pub!  It's turned on the stereo!
Now how did you get hurt?
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
Sir... have you a name?
So, do we go on?
Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
Vox?
This has to end.
Takes a licking but keeps on ticking...  ... For a while anyway.
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
You took her because she helped me.
Now will you go?
That was a foolish thing to do.
I could have a hundred Morlocks here in thirty seconds.
God -- could have killed me -- bad girl, Nell!  How did you know to do that?
Well, much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say, if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation.  Tell you all about her.
May I help you?
Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
You're late.
All right, what is it now?
Dance with me...
All right...
... One day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him. The thick brow, so lacking in imagination.  The dim little eyes, devoid of curiosity.
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
What happened to Emma will never go away.  It's part of you now and it always will be.  But you have to learn to live with it...
Couldn't help but overhearing.  Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  I wish you the very best.
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
This is magnificent...
The mud carriers.
It's not supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be beautiful.
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
Oh very.  Learning, commerce, the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.
Yes... I suppose so.
Mara -- what -- ?!
It was different then.
Sir, Mr. Philby is here.
Yes, sir, he --
No, sir --
With respect, sir, would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could?
My equations are not parlor-tricks!
"Eloi"?
We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren.  Do you know him?
Oh, very different.  But not entirely... I mean we have lots of, um, trees and such.  But not everywhere.  And more roads.  And buildings.
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
You know that's not true.
You won't even try?
I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
Should we be...
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.
You're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition.
It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year.
Becker, how do you sleep at night?
Of people like you. People I was just trying to help. They couldn't get worse so I thought, with medication, they might get...
That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.
You look like you've lost some weight. Are you eating?
I need to get this letter to someone.
I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then.
But I like it I guess.
No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
I looked it up.
I'm telling you I don't care what time you think you're in. You're not William Starks. [Beat] I don't believe in many things, but I believe in death. And it doesn't give back what it takes. So whoever you are...I did a nice thing, you've made me regret it enough already, so please, just leave.
But no one knew until after...
[Beat] You bled to death.
[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
How long do we have?
I might not be able to.
They're not here.
Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?
That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.
What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
You gotta stop thinking like that.
[Beat] You be good to yourself, Jackie.
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?
You don't understand.
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?
Why don't you help me?
And how do you know that?
He's having absence [pronounced "absance"] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly.
I tried to kill my wife.
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister?
Of course you don't know.
What's this?
Well, good for you.
You don't think that's crazy?
But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
On what?
Could you identify 'em, if ya saw 'em again?
Well, you're not exactly an expert witness, but what makes you so sure?
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
Hey.
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
You know, certain words and phrases just keep floating through my mind, things like incarceration, cavity search, life imprisonment, death by electrocution, that sort of thing. So, come out alive?  I don't know. Let us think about that.
What kind of gun was it?
Did you get married real young?
That sounds nice.
How?
You're kinda the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.
Well, come on, gal, I got you a room.  You can go on in and take a nice cold shower.
Where'd y'all go?
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
You didn't say what it was for, did you?
What?
Hey, peaches.
You wanna take it out of your wallet, please?
Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.
Not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me.  Hi.  What'd he say?
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.
In case of what?
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened.
We gotta be inconspicuous.  Do you know what that means?
We're gonna go to the next town and stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  We're gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you?
You could help me try and figure it out!  I gotta figure out what to do, and you could try and help me.
Did you finish thinking?
Yup.  That's him goin'.  I love to watch him go.
I don't care what you say about him. The boy has got it bad.
So what are you gonna tell him?
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  You're making a spectacle.
I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?
No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you even...
I am really sorry about this.
Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.
What'd I say again?
What?
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
I mean really!  That business with your tongue.  What is that?  That's disgusting!
How far are we from Mexico?
Shit!
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
Louise!
Isn't it beautiful?!!
What?  What are you talkin' about?
We're fine!  How are you?
Where you goin'?
Hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to scratch that thing, huh?
You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.
Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.
Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
Give me a break. Remember five years ago, when your kidneys failed? If you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match? What are the odds of that, one in a million?
Mary again.
I mean since then.
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
You're kidding? What did they say?
Fuck me.  Let's go home.
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
Healy you dog!
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
Stalker, huh?
Take it easy, that's Bill.
Nineteen months I been sober.
I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.
Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency... especially after what I did.  I lied to this poor girl. Lied, man. She deserved better.
Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?
A surprise?
Is this one art deco or art nouveau?
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
Turn it up, Magda.
Are you okay?
Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and roses... and I'm really happy. Leave a message. BEEP.
All you want is a phone number?
Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. Now I want you to level with me: Did you knock this skirt up?
Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds.
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
Miami?
Jai alai?
Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me.
Okay, tell you what: I'll get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from Japan.
Turn her over to a stalker.
Oh Christ... poor dog.
Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal?
Among others.
Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids.
Have you been to  Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
Oh... Sully.
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
How do you guarantee that?
So who's the lucky guy?
The point is, love isn't about money or social standing or age, it's about connecting with someone, having things in common kindred spirits.
Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was?
An old flame?
You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night?
Holy shit...
Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
Uh, well... not exactly. You see, I exaggerated a little there.
Oh yeah. Fine.
Are you all right?
You asshole, what are you --  Mary! Is that you?
And did everything -- ?
Oh. So... what brings you down here?
Now by killer, you mean...?
So you're a writer?
Please leave.
Go!
Get over here.
Yeah? What do you want?
I, uh... I got it stuck.
Piggyback ride.
We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?
See you, Warren.
I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.
This was not the President's intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets don't see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just did?  There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral?
He's right, Jack. Taylor is saying we may have some time. We've got to use it.
I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.
The other thing is...
Adlai's too weak! We have to convince Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there.
Oh, still sore about this.
Adlai can handle Zorin. He knows the inning and the score.
Jack and Bobby are good men. But it takes a certain character, moral toughness to stand up to --
Max.
Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
Pretending there isn't a problem won't fix it. He can clear the air on Anglo American relations.
It's Tuesday. You said to call. When do I get my 45 minutes?
Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
Yeah? Who was he talking to? Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on. What's Acheson doing in town? And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War.
Hey, sport. You winning?
I was eating that.
Still think Cuba isn't important?
Should be here any minute.
I'm not calling and canceling on Daly. You call and cancel on Daly.
You'd worry that something was wrong if Congress offered you unconditional support.
That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command...
I don't want to listen to this again.
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
Dangle a settlement, tie us down in negotiations, we come up short...
That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.
Bob. Bet you had a late night.
Bob?
Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection.
Hey.
You know how in your big cities, you got your niggers and you got your Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got Indians. That's just the way it is.
Ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as The Badlands. Indian Reservation.
Nice piece. You come back here to cover your tracks, Geronimo? What's your name?
Somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, Officer Crow Foot.
Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.
No. That's Ray here. Ray...
I got one up on ya.
Who is he?
What'd she say?
Cooch.  Where the fuck did they send us?
You ever put your hands on me again and you'll be doing the books for a baitshop in the fucking Everglades, Mister.
I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony?
You're an easy man to track, Ray. Ya walk like a penguin with a hard-on.
He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information.
Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
But he is not unhappy with you because he knows you.
Still after Jimmy?
Where was this?
Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?
Jesus. Oil?
1868...
He's gone.
You're the Indian FBI.
This Jimmy's?
Who did?
Ray...
Do you want a coffee?
They said I'd never see FBI again, and I'm livin' with you fuckers. I don't feed ya information on the Warriors, it's back to the pen. I don't do this, back to the pen. Your word against my word. Against a con Indian's word. I really got a chance, man, right?
No way. No fuckin' way.
It isn't?
How so?
Why not?
It never came up.
Well, what you need...what you have to keep looking for...what you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you. Who can match you move for move. Then you've got something.  I'm sorry.
Lieutenant...
What if he's not?
How about what?
You ever think about killing another human being?
Does it bother you?
Come on.
I want it understood.
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
This is it, then.
Where are we?
I want it back.
You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which.
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.
Well... What   is   it?
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
Yes, Sergeant?
MAVERICK.
This is crazy!
I've got it -- hold on!
No! Not again!
You hear that? Anything we want. Anything...Well???
Why do you all have such funny names?
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
Did what?
The list is long, but distinguished.
So I've heard.
Tom Kazansky.
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.
What the hell is this?
1000.
That's Kazanski.
Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.
But, Skipper, Cougar's been picked for Top Gun...He's the best of the best!
Hear about Ice?
I'VE GOT TWO MORE BOGEYS COMING IN AT FOUR O'CLOCK HIGH.
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
I guess I owe you one.
The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
I don't know what to tell you, Skip.
You won?!!!
Was going.  Now you are.
You just did an incredibly brave thing! What you should have done was land your plane. You don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. I should ream you out for it. But it just doesn't work with you. You're a hell of a flyer. You are maybe ...too good. You never really stepped in it yet. So this is your chance. I'm gonna send you up against the best. They are better than you. Maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it. Maverick hasn't really heard anything but TOPGUN. He snaps out of it.
SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..
We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "CNC" --course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.
And if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.
How could you do this?  You're a mutant.
Don't bother looking.  It's in your skull.
I didn't want it to end this way.  I wanted Hauser back.  But nooo.  You had to be Quaid.
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?
Stop fighting and get out.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
What do you want?
Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me.
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.
On his way.
Yeah.
No shit...
What trip?
I did?
What are you, my father?
Are you saying she liked it?
I've got a weak signal over there.
Who is she?
Doug, maybe we should take a trip.
Well...What do you say?
Harry from work...He was the boss.
Let me finish!
You call this a paranoid delusion?!
The hell you're not.
You sure you don't wanna...?  For old time's sake.  If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.
Nooo!  I would never do anything to hurt you.  I want you to come back to me.
First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights:  Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course...  Venusville.
Go on.
I thought Cohaagen tortured you to death!
I don't remember you.
Hauser?  You're Hauser.
Forget I said wife.
I'm not falling for it.
What reactor?!
You sure about this?
The whole core of Mars is ice.  The reactor melts it and releases oxygen.
Or a big mother slug maybe?
You stupid punk!  You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
Yeah, like they got a plan...
What?  Well, for chrissake, we could have made a stand at our place!  We had food, water...
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
Let's go you two.  We're headed for the mountains.
That's fine.  We've got some new things to teach them.
Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!
BACK OFF, BURT...!
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.
He'll never make it!  They're gonna get him!
We're not going over there, right?
Tammy Lynn Baxter.
So?  That car wash pays good, and they're always looking.
We did it!  We faced temptation and we did not bend!
Fuck you!
Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of <u>any</u>thing like this before?
You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here.
I'm gonna kick his ass!
Its tires are flat...
Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!
Watch your ass, shithead.
What the hell are you doing?!!
<u>People</u>?  Hell, <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.
Well, I brung her something I know she likes.
Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
Hi, guys, what you been up to?
You sure this is where it was?
Come on.  Get away from it!
And I appreciate it.
What?!!  Since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!
Objection, your Honor! The fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial!
"We"?
We don't prosecute people because in the abstract they might be weak. Judge Brandeis said it best: Entrapment is a "dirty business!"
-- a speed manufacturer --
Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.
At the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. Alone.
Uh, Eddie? The, um, ballistics guy, George...? He called, and...  His tests show that Shu's gun fired the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin.
A fucking wheelchair?
Eddie -- it's Art Esparza!
...Jesus!
How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?
Lemme guess. Some corporate V.P.'s banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder.
I've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the Tri-state area. No one's heard of Chuckie Roeder.
Eddie... A guilty client's not the end of the world...
Figures.
But why?
-- About what?
You won't remember this, but in '72 I was one of several prosecutors assigned to the Black Panther-Police Shootout.  We had a whole team, and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt.  So what've you been up to since then?
My staff tells me it's been mostly drug pushers... I said that can't be the same Edward Dowd.
I see: He'd walk out next month.
Isn't it unusual for a man who's just committed a murder in plain sight to bring the weapon back to his apartment?
Your Honor, that's trial by ambush!
-- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?
Did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?
I don't think I know that name.
Isn't it true that without Esparza, you had no investigation?
It's okay. It was always like that.
Look. Mister --
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
Mr. Ortega, what is Shu Kai Kim's rank within La Compania?
Go away. I am not talking to you.
That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.
Here he comes.
Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
It's 4:30. We close at five.
Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.
Thanks for your help, Carl. Sorry we woke you up.
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
GOT A MAP OF THE ENVIRONS OF THE YAKIMA INDIAN RESERVATION WITH YOUR NAME ON IT. BETTER BRING A POLE.
Congratulations. I heard about that.
And no one found the ring?
He's dead -- good and dead.
He's with me.  Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out?
You know, I never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, Teresa's arm went completely dead.
Lil was wearing a sour face.
Oh, the uncle is missing.
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
I see. He does talk loud.
Accidental?
You better dust this place, Sam.
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
James called me last night looking for you.
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
Do you want to talk?
This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
Where are you going?
No.  I don't need to take this to be your friend.
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
You know what that Big "E" stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm.
My secret diary. There are pages missing.
I hate him, I hate it. Sometimes I love it. But now I'm afraid. I am so afraid.
Did you make me a tape?
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
Right on time, baby.
We're on our way, Baby.
Laura, do you love me?
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
I've got to see you.
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
Bobby killed a guy.
No.
You'd think so.
I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way I feel. It's the custom thing I was thinking of. In America we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. We throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head.
Laura.
I hate asparagus.
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
Dad.
Let me see.
Laura. What's wrong this morning?
Hello, Laura. Hello Sarah. Where's my axe?  "I'm hungry".
Bobby didn't give you this?
Shelly, would you give Laura a quick hand with the "Meals on Wheels"?
You're right. There's no one here.
Mr. Abraham...
Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
We thought it was just.
Yes.
...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
You would not...?
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying?
That's not my handwriting.
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four years? This is a... why? Why would you do that?
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. Is that correct?
Orthopedics?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
What book is that?
Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
I did.
Ed Concannon.
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
Objection! This is ri... expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
Thank you, your Honor. We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.' And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now: we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
No, actually, she was referred to me. She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't 'part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist. Isn't that right?
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
We went to Code Blue...
...we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
It's all right, Mickey.
I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.
I didn't do too well for you.
I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
I am seventy-four years old.
I am on the staff of...
She getting good care over there?
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
Thank you.
Yes.
What did she say?
That's it...?  Come on, guys... life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.  Frank: I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand... and that's a lot of money... and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
What is it?
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out... They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case. Now this is it today.
Exception!
I changed my life today. What did you do?
What Hotel are you staying at?
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth? You want another drink?
What happened...?
Do you think it's my fault?
And it's over...?
Well, then what are you doing here?
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
You're pressuring yourself...
Is it over?
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand.
I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
It's not a good case. It's a very good case.
My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue...
Dr. Gruber.
Uh...
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
I have to talk to you.
Are you out of your mind...?
...he's a good man...
Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
That's right.
She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
What the hell are you doing here?
What are you doing in New York...?
We got a mistrial, you know. Joe -- did you hear what I said...?
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
What happened in those three...
Brain damage could have been... it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
Looks almost cold now, don't it?
We'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?
That explains why communication is cut the moment their machines begin to move.
There's nobody left around here now.
I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
The troops are certainly moving in here!
Good to see you, General.  This is Pastor Collins, director of Civil Defense.  Sheriff Bogany, head of the local forces ... Miss Van Buren.
You'll hit something!  Can't you go higher?
Where are we?
I almost forget when I ate last.  It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.
I stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me.  It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
What was it like?
They've blocked it!
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
What is that gizmo?!
We know now that we can't beat their machines -- but we can beat them!  They are mortal beings...The only question is whether we have time enough to do anything!
I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
Colonel - shooting's no good!
We will, sir!
Better'n a lion farm or a snake pit. We won't have to feed it!
They'll understand us, all right!
The nightmares.
So I don't know about horror.
Sweetie, you've got lots of fans, we've done market studies.  You rate right up there.  We've already got Chase working on a prototype for the glove.
Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?
Anything other than the obvious bothering you?
What's up?
Was there any trigger event?  A trauma, shock or...  You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you?  The horror stuff?
Does he have to stay here over night?
DO you mind...
"Then their father covered them with kisses and they were safe."
I can't sleep there, Mommy.  Please!
What...what is that?
Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.
You're not crazy, by the way.
Seemed, not was.
A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.
Heather Langenkamp?
The car's no there yet?
I can tell you what the nightmares are about.  They're about this...entity. Whatever you want to call it.  It's old, very old, and it's taken different forms in different times.  The only thing that stays the same about it is what it lives for.
This is still a script we're talking about, right?
Captured?  How?
That was Nancy, not me!
Yes?
Can I get you something to drink?
That low passed through last night. May be a little bumpy out there.
You may not like what you hear.
Because we believed we could make an impact out here.  Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing.
So to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
Raise the inner jib!  Raise the forestaysail!
But your instinct was to lose sail?
When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  But you can't make this okay, can you?
Albatross?
Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
Ninety-six.
It's a ninety-one!  It's an 'A'!
I've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life.  It's what they expect. After all this, I still haven't figured it out.
He does.
God damn it man.  I think he broke my nose!
Can we talk?
Is it true Phil?
Sorry to here it.
But that's not the point...
You think Skipper and Alice do it?
So... What happened?
My parents don't do it anymore.
Who told you that?
My brother.  He fell out of the old beech tree.  Broke his neck.  I was on a camp out.  They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down...  They didn't find him 'till the next morning.  They didn't even know why he was up there.
Uh, huh.
Shouldn't we turn away?
What's on your mind?
Why do you think I'm sending him home?
The Dolphin was a symptom.
I mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is.  What right did then have to show up here?
Does Phil know how you guys feel?
Chicken is a fool's game captain.
I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my son, Philip.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
We'll do our best.  You're welcome to say goodbye.
What's wrong, you don't like steak?
Spying?!
Son-of-a-bitch.
And being sixteen.
Jesus.  She's got guns.
What?  Come on...
It matters to me.
Why, man?
I don't.
Well, that was neighborly.
Fuck off man.  It's just a fish.
About yourself?
Phil.  What are you doing?
Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear.  Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch.  Everyone else hit the racks.
Don't look down.  Look in my eyes! Climb!  We'll do it together.
No.
I can't be sure.
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
They are much more than that, sir.
Yes, that's true.
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
Y'all take American Express?
I'd just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one, if it's same to you.
You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.
Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
No.
No.
Whattaya mean family?
Couple grand or more'd give you two a leg up. Get you to the west coast, Mexico, most anyplace, with a few dollars in your jeans. I got it figured good, Sailor.
Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?
...But DAMN man... This better go smooth.
Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.
But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.
You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
The same to you. If you are in Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and visit us. The Hondurans are great friends of the American people. But I have a joke for you before I go. If a liberal, a socialist, and a communist all jumped off the roof of the Empire State Building at the same time, which one of them would hit the ground first?
Gotta admit, you guys are -  two in four dozen.
I forgot to show you this. The gentlemen that gave this to me said you'd recognize it. Said he wanted it'd be 'bout the last thing you ever saw in this life.
You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
Maybe I was there, but I didn't see anythin'. All I know's that trash killed a man with his bare hands. Hands which are now prob'ly all over my baby!
No, Marietta, I haven't found 'em.
Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if I could pick up their trail.
I did, honey, but that was last night... Let's just find those two kids before it's too late.
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
Damn it, child! Now look what you made me do.
I'm scared, mama.
Hey baby...
Hey, my snakeskin jacket... Thanks, baby... Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom?
Did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin' flyin' in?... Did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone?
Uncle Pooch came in the side door through the porch, you know? Where I was makin' a jelly and banana sandwich? I remember I had my hair in curlers cause I was goin' that night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the DeSoto sisters. Uncle Pooch must have known nobody but me was home, cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter.
So how'd he finally nail you? Right there in the kitchen?
He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.
Just you. Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after. And he never did anything else to me. I always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?
Hell, you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all.
That don't seem fair.
Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.
...I hope you appreciate my spendin' six hundred dollars, not countin' what it cost us to get here and back... This man's the best damn abortionist in the South.
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
Let's go dancin', peanut. I'm ready.
One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...
She looked right at me and run her tongue over her lips and put her hand on my arm - told me her name was Irma.
What'll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it don't rain much there.
That don't smell like a More.
You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
I ain't never met anyone come close to you, sugar.
Who do?
Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'!
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
What's wrong, sweetheart? Somethin' botherin' you?
How much we got left, honey?
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
The world's gettin' worse, I think, Sailor. And it don't sound like there's much we can do about it, neither.
They have, sugar.
Trust me on it.
And no AC.
Darlin', I still ain't feelin' so well. I'm goin' to bed.
Who says I'm smart? You up to somethin' with Bobby Peru, Sailor?
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that?
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
Course I am, mama.
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
What do you want me to do about it?
Take care of him?
What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
Get rid of him?
Just tell me what you want.
You need to explain it.
Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
You got nice tits.
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
By who?
You really are one dumb asshole.
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
I'll tell you the problem. You behind the wheel. There's your fucking problem.
Actually... I just want to go home.
I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in?
It's the Chancellor.
Tripp!
I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes to be published. What you do as a writer, what I do as an editor...
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
You're stoned.
I just mean...
Left you...? Who? Emily?
I'm sure. Where is everyone?
He lives with his mother.
Yes.
What's this guy's problem?
Wait here. I'll be right back.
You stay there.
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
You know -- based on what I've read -- this is a very exciting piece of material, this Big Parade.
How bad is it for you?
Shut up, James.
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
Came to my senses.
It's cool, Jeff. Really.
I've been doing that a lot lately.
Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe.
She told you about...
Better luck next time.
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
Sure.
What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just...
It's just... for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet...
Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room.
You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp.
James.  Don't leave just yet. There's something I think you ought to see.
The one she wore on her wedding day?
Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question?
Can I ask you something about her?
Thank you.
He didn't give his name.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
Washed up?
How's that?
There is, but it's not that interesting.
I've got a thing about, places like this. I know what those houses are like. I know what the people are like.
Humboldt County?
It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a small town.
Outside Scranton.
Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my mom. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
When we fall, we fall hard.
Maybe she didn't come here.
Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.
It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
But, last night...
I'm not going with them.
I'm not going, with them.
Professor Tripp...?
Me? Sure. Why?
He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his friend. All right?
James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
New?
You go first.
And? Are you going to tell him?
Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
Oh?
Someone stole my car.
And what do you think you might have said?
He told you.
I'm through improvising.
I know.
I need a ride.
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.
You mean because his career's ruined and all?
Walter?
Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub all kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb.
What exactly are we doing here, Professor Tripp?
What made you pull out that old thing?
She's in Philadelphia seeing Linda Aahby. The neurologist.
Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious... Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.
No, the dog.
Hey, is that a school?
I was just thinking of... the noise.
I should go. Your sister worries, and when she worries she yells.
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
Ah, come on.
There's little chicks!  You want to see?
A solitary vireo. I like that one.
I'd love to hear it.
Something like that.
Don't you have friends?
A pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends.
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
Doesn't everybody?
Cherry?
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
So. How are you adjusting?
Just trying to be helpful.
No.
A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.
Robin?
How do you know?
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
Walter?
And how's your job?
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
You seem a little hostile today.
I'd like you to keep a journal.
That's right.
Try it.
You don't like coming here, do you?
Then why are you talking about this?
Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns?
Do you think you're crazy?
Will I ever be normal?
How do they know?
I want to be normal!
You don't know!
Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!
Walter, we'll pick up here next time.
Go home, Walter.
I'd like you to close your eyes.
No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
Where is she? What is she doing? How old --
And what are you doing?
What the hell are you doing there?
Don't ever do that again.
I don't like nobody behind my back!
You felt pleasure.
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
You don't hang out with the other guys.
Is that a school?
They could eat you.
Do you?
Sorry.
Get your kicks somewhere else.
I've changed.
And what do you tell yourself now?
I got poked around... here and there.
I love my brothers.
Sneak up behind me like that.
Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension.  So there you were--
You done impressing yourself, ace?
Nice shot, Lins.
My rig.  I designed the damn thing.
You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.
You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do.  What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What would have you done?
I think you were worried about me.
No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.
What are you still wearing that for?
Hippy, just relax.  You're making the women nervous.
Need some help?
No.
It was a machine, but it seems almost alive. Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a feeling.
You dumb jarhead motherf--
He's got the shakes?
You owe me one, Virgil.
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
Hello, Brigman.
No, I mean it.  Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly.  Something's going on.
Come on, man.  What else could it be?
Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.
Cat, you tie onto this manifold.  There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.
We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.
Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
Cab One, radiation readings?
Copy that, continuing forward.  You just want me to get shots of everything, right?
Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.
1840... 50... 60... 70...
A non-terrestrial intelligence.
No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
Getting a reading?
High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.
Sandro... A month is too long a time. I have become used to being without you.
In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married?
It's already two hours... What are we going to do?
What is that one over there called?
Well?
Really! Still, it remains to be seen why she invented a shark. What was her purpose in that?
Don't be so humble.
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
Have you read it?... They're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them.
What is it, Claudia?
Does it please you to say such things?
Claudia, let's get married?
You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
I don't love you.
Have you ever been in love?
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
Do you consider that a compliment?
How did you spend the night?... In that hut?... And what did you have to eat?
And what are we going to do now?
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
Ettore...
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
The trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you, that's all.
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
We have a radio like this, too.
And why wouldn't we have one like this?
Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here.
Then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in Noto; are there any hotels or rooming houses?
And here's Sandro.  Why don't you two go upstairs and change?
Did you manage to find good rooms?
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
Now, tell the truth, aren't you a bit disappointed?... But I already told you...
Here I am, Patrizia. I'm always here.
Zuria?
I would like to ask you something.
No.
I am, there's too much flesh on me.
No... I mean... I mean look at these. I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp.
But she watches... she listens.
No I don't... the host is enough.
Of God.
No I'm not.
I don't know.
Who?
Well, who in particular?
Where do you meet?
Something I ate.
Down... there.
I fell asleep.
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
From God.
Are you married?
Would you like to be?
Why do you smoke?
One.
Do you know a Marie?
No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?
Why not?  Mmm?
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
Is that what she said?
Yes?
Oh, yes.
Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright?
Agnes, you're stupid.
Of telling you.
Did you know what was going to come out?
Why?
Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
A wastepaper basket.
Who?
Do you remember what just happened?
That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
Agnes, can you hear me?
Yes.
So I could go to him.
Stay away from me...
I hate him.
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
What did you do?
Larry there's got to be something missing.
Thanks. 
All I want is one more week.
Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
Oh that one there, in the corner.
I can beat that.
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
I've already told you what I thought.
You don't really believe something like that happened do you?
Who?
Shortly after she came to us.
Not simple, no.
Visitors to the convent.
Oh, Dear God...
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
Listening to angels?
Do you know what she did to her?
And my permission?
An unhappy woman...
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
Pipe!
Mary Magdelen?
Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
For Agnes.
But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
Hasn't she had enough?
Was it you?
Did you know she was pregnant?
The baby?
You went to the room to help with the birth.
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.
All right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do.
You don't think...
We're nearly there, sir.
Grotty?
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.
Gerron.
Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
That must have cost you a fortune in stamps, Ringo.
Should I say it?
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.
Sorry.
I see.  Do you like the play?
Gear?
You don't half slam the door in people's faces, do you? I mean, what about when you're playing the part, like, hundreds of people'll see you and ...
Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?
Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever.
And what do you do about it?
Will you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!
Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
Do you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.
A book!
Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?
Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
That sergeant's a body-blow veteran if ever I measured one. One of us has got to escape. I'll get the boys. Hold on son, I'll be back for you.
You ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.
That's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.
And another thing, where's that old mixer?
Is that yours?
We've broken out, oh, the blessed freedom of it all!  Eh, have you got a nail file, these handcuffs are killing me. I was framed. I was innocent.
Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
If you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats.
No.
Paul, John, George - get at it.
They're nearly ready for you. They're just finishing the band call.
John, I'm talking to you. This final run through is <U>important</U>. Understand? Important.
You are.
Well, you look like him.
Is it?
Aye, but you know him well.
That's what you tell me.
It'll only get you into trouble.
Where's my grandfather?
Do I have to raise me voice?
Yeah, down the ... er ...
What?
I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.
There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.
Are you in pain?
I don't recognize that constellation.
I got it.  Oh boy.
Gravity?
It's... basalt.  Rock.
I'm sending.  Do you hear me?
Okay, I'm in the mouth of the chimney now, and I'm starting down.
Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
I'm really starving; can we get some food before we go into the freezers?
Breathe deeply.
A transmission?
You like this shit?
You know what they make this stuff out of?
But we can't kill it.  If we kill it, it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space.
Dead!
What the hell's going on?
That one section of the ventilator shaft has only two outlets -- you notice?  The food storage room on one end --
Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are clogged with dust.  We overheated and burned out a whole cell.
It's really on there tight.
Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
There.  Should be coming through about there.
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
He's running a fever.
While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net.
We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there. 
But they don't know about the translation!  They could be in danger right now.
Why, you chickenshit bastard --
Look at that.
What's happening up here?
This should do it.
Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness.  How long till dawn?
It's close, real close.
No, it's coming.
It won't come -- it's stuck.
We're going home.  We're in hyperspace.
I've got Hunter... and something else as well, in front of him.
All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.
Yeah, okay. 
Still worried?
This ship is full of cat hair.
Hey, can you guys hear me?
We can't leave him out here, open the door.
Would somebody fill me in?
That's the part that always makes me feel like I'm gonna puke -- when we accelerate into light speed.
Now what?
You know, it's funny -- this stuff we went to so much trouble to dig up -- this treasure, the paydirt -- it'll make it back to Irth just fine -- even if we're not with it.
And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --
Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?
Let's get back and call this in.
A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.
Auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.
Alright, okay.  Look...
But I'm going first...
Hold it, hold it...
What?  Where?
Can't see a thing.  Are you sure?
That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here?
Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display.
She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up.
That's what we thought.
I've got a lot of thinking to do.  'Sides, the room was getting too crowded for me.
Any luck raising Ackland's party?
Do you believe him?
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly...
It needn't be.
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...
Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it.
You know me better than that.
The mark of a true killer.  Sleep tight, rest easy - and come out fighting...
So that's it. Lloyd. Still just the Theater, after all...
I can't believe my ears...
I had to get in, to meet Margo! I had to say something, be somebody, make her like me!
And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
That isn't a waiter, my dear. That's a butler.
This must be, at long last, our formal introduction. Until now we have met only in passing...
From the smartness of your dress, I take it your luncheon companion is a lady?
Naturally enough, your understudy.
How... how was Miss Caswell?
Bill...
Only in some ways. You're prettier...
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
I told her. I sounded off.
Bill...
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
Okay.
I'll check with Eve...
It's a good thought.
Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
So she seems.
For instance what?
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
It's all over.
What fire and music?
The playwright doesn't make the performance - and it doesn't just happen! And this one didn't - full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed I have no doubt, over and over, full of those Bill Sampson touches!
I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
It's not nonsense.
I wish it were.
I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?
With the paper to prove it.
Why what?
But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there.
Ah...
Yes. Yes, it does.
- little things here and there, it doesn't matter. You can be proud of yourself, you've got a right to be.
Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.
And this is my good friend and companion, Miss Birdie Coonan.
She works hard.
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
What are you doing here?
You probably won't believe me.
You're going to Hollywood - aren't you?  From the trunks you're packing, you must be going to stay a long time.
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
You see the play? You've seen the play every performance?  But, don't you find it - I mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive?
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
Hello, Miss Channing.
Not just that way. As a friend...
There should be a new word for happiness. Being here with Miss Channing has been - I just can't say, she's been so wonderful, done so much for me-
Don't worry too much about that. Margo just doesn't miss performances. If she can walk, crawl or roll - she plays.
You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
We're having lunch with a movie talent scout.
I've got a lot to say. And none of it is easy.
But the raves about your performance-
He can help you.
Eve. I - I don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. But you did. More to yourself, perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else...
You want to play "Cora." You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.
Hello, Miss Harrington.
No, thank you.  Yes. I've seen every performance.
I guess it started back home. Wisconsin, that is. There was just mum, and dad - and me. I was the only child, and I made believe a lot when I was a kid - I acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. But somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more, it got so that I couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me... I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I?
Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo, let me tell you about Eve-
Well. If I didn't come to see the play, I wouldn't have anywhere else to go.
Stick around. Please. Tell you what - we'll put Stanislavsky on his plane, you and I, then go somewhere and talk.
The curtains. I made them myself.
The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is there anything else I can do?
It's the tight girdle that does it.
Relax, kid. It's only me and my big mouth...
Ain't it the truth?
How much time have we?
He always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical-
I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
Karen.  I haven't been pleasant this weekend.
So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me...
What about Bill?
Margo, again...
We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...
- it's Addison, from start to finish, it drips with his brand of venom... taking advantage of a kid like that, twisting her words, making her say what he wanted her to say-
Eve.
She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...
You've got to admit it would be a novelty.
Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine.
I'm glad Bill's back.
The general atmosphere is very Macbethish. What has or is about to happen?
Don't be evasive.
... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-
I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago-
I'm sure.
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
I never said it was!
Yes, sir.
I don't think I could be.
Call, what call?
Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?
Margo. You by any chance got bicarbonate of soda in the house?
When's the audition?
Anything to help you out, Max.
This is for lawyers to talk about, this concerns a run-of-the-play contract, and this you can't rewrite or ad lib!
What the hell were you doing rewriting my story--
Carl?
All right, what do we know?
And McCord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the Democratic convention.  The Times has got to be full of it-- it can't be crazy Cubans.
Hey?
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
I don't get it... this really was my turf...
We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us.
We understand your problem--
I hate both parties.
How do you want to handle Sloan?
--there had to be a White House overseer--
--The L.A. Times has a huge interview with Baldwin--
--we gotta top the Times--
Segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six months--and never stayed anyplace over a night or two.  Switch to another station, huh? You're driving me crazy with that.
California, Illinois, Florida, New Hampshire--all the major Democratic primary states.  Why does everything you play sound the same?
What would you have done?
--That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats--five guys had control--
--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.
--what time is it?
Look, you've been jerking my chain all day. If there's some reason you can't talk to me--like the fact that you've already leaked everything to The New York Times--just say so.
Harry, I just talked to a Miami investigator about Barker--
--you got more than one source?--
What's a real denial?
I thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story--  --you think I like being aced out?
Hey, easy...
I was just curious--you don't do it well, so I wondered. Have you been threatened, if you told the truth, is that it?
I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
The ones who could disburse the money.
It's awfully hot--  --and you haven't finished telling me about the money--
No games, Irwin; give.
Who by?
Try and understand this. I'm a decent Republican. I believe in Richard Nixon. I worked in the White House four years--so did my wife. What happened on June 17 I don't think the President knew anything about. Some of his men I'm not so sure of.
But they both worked at the White House?
I really can't talk now--
--that leaves Haldeman, period.
Same kind of crap--
What's this?
It will, it just hasn't bottomed out yet, give it time.
Anything else from Mr. Throat?
Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record, when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in the courtroom, "I'm not here," Mr. Caddy said.
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
--this should take only a minute, Mr. Dahlberg, but we're doing a follow- up on the break-in--  --and I was kind of curious about your check.
I saw the flag signal--what's up?
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
You'll have to find that out, won't you.
What?
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
I'm so glad you could come, Mr.--
You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?"  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?
Never? Please don't tell me never.  Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.
--you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions--
--correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci--
Ask him what he's really saying--he means take the story away from Woodstein and give it to his people at the National Desk--
OK, get on this W.House guy and do a better job then you did on McCord.
What'd you get on W.House?
--who you got?--
Anything?
Howard--
That was awhile ago.
Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?
--no--
What do you think Mrs. Graham wants to see me for?
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
Mr. Sloan?
Does "they" mean the White House?
I can't say anything, I'm sorry. 
Go on.
You work there, Miss Abbott.
Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean <u>really</u> fast.
Me too.  For the most part.
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
Hey, what're you doing here?
Um...Chris --
Hi...
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
So we're gonna be close next year?
This isn't the best way to proposition me.
I think I've had one.
...I've never tried it.
Jessica, can you drive me home?
There's our man.
Gotta go.
That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
Hey, where's Finch?
How do you know that?
Yeah?  Well come prom night, those excuses aren't going to do you much good.
No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?
Dad.
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
No...you...go...ahead.
Okay...that would be cool sometime.  How 'bout tomorrow?
Shame on you!
No, no, you must put your whole body into it.
Ho-lee shit.
Kevin!  You seen Shitbreak lately?
Tonight?
Let me know.
And I want to try to make it up to you.
Hey...
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
I can't believe we just had our senior prom.
You called me to ask me how to get laid?
That's good, that's what I needed to hear.  Now you qualify.
Then she said -- she loves me.
Bullshit.  From where?
Let's face it. It's a, how do you say... mother-fucker. But we're all in it together. That's why we're trying to help you.
Merde! Just missed!
The key is don't look down.
Thanks for the lovely evening, shithead!
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
So you came after all. Just in time, it's getting interesting.
What about your glasses?
Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?
Hello?
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf.
Because, Andy. It's a cure.
I hope they fucking fry us all.
We can't stop him. Not now. Handcuffed, with no kind of weapons. Please Andy...
I know where he'll go.
No wonder he let her go.
Whoa...
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
Oh God. Shit...
GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!
Where's the ADM? Where did your uncle put it?
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
Before the coma!
Saint Severin? The church? So you know all about the ADM!  Where is it! Tell me! Tell me or else!
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?
Psychic awareness. Right.
Andy...
Because Gaston was after it.
Uncle Terrence?
Uncle Terrence, you're...
He's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my English is better.  This way... So you're from New York eh? I love those Hill Street Blues...
Jesus...
Not that I know.
Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
Alright. Let me write a letter.
Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive?  Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
Andy!
What've you got?
I need two tactical assault squads at Place Denfert immediately. You can tell the commissioner it's a code red.
"Together in Paris"! Oh, when can we be "together in Paris?!
Hurry, Grandmama!
Anya! What if <u>we</u> can't find anyone who loves us?!
Who did you hear it from?
We're just going to refresh your memory...
Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him!
Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too 
You never thought of the possibility?
By pulling my hair?!
I'm going to stretch my legs
Just what do you think you're doing?!
I'm sorry.
Oh! I'm sorry...
Anya, wait!
I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
Do you remember this?
PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
Hey, she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.
Yesss... our power is much stronger when were near. We must get close to her.
What was that?
The "Odessa Dunk"?
Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
So where will you go?
I'll show you!
I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
I'm not Ulo and I won't slow down. But you will listen to me!
Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years...  You could have found it...
I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
Empress, no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry...
Fellas... you know-Jesus! Come on!
Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ!
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
It-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
Look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that?
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
You? You kiddin'?  If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.
Don't give it to me. Don't!
So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what...  Am I your first big romance?
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
He was creepy.
Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
So, how long do you know Janet? Where do you know her from?
I, uh... well, you're not from New York, right?
For yuh.
Sylvia Plath.
Uh, narcolepsy.
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
I know.
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.
And-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension. You know, we never kissed before and I'll never know when to make the right move or anything. So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.
My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.
M'm, that was so nice. That was nice.
H'm?
Oh, yeah?
Yeah?
Here, you want some?
Hey?
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
You- Do you love me?
I love you.  You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you.  I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
Yeah, I know it's small.
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
No, don't be silly. What-what do we need other people for?  You know, we should-we should just turn out the lights, you know, and play hide and seek or something.
Uh-uh-why?
Were you always funny?
Yeah.
You followed me!
That is the worst kind of paranoia.
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
Oh, it was...  really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
She said, "Will it change my wife." You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy.
David! David! I can't believe this!
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
I told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. You never know who's gonna crawl over.
Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
What is this? What are you, since when do you read the "National Review"? What are you turning in to?
Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I came over to --
Darling, darling, I've been killing spiders since I was thirty, okay?
Okay, let me have this.
Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? Geez.  Don't worry!  I did it! I killed them both. What- what's the matter? Whatta you-  whatta you sad about? You- What'd you want me to do? Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?
I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice.
Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?
Oh, look, look, there's that... that's that's my old house. That's where we used to live.
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
Check it out.
yes, we had, uh...
...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
Yeah, this place is great.
This "Denial of Death". You remember this?
God.
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
You mean that...  I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to see you.
Oh!
I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery.
Here you are. There's people out there.
Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?
Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it-it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-
Hey, come on, it's quiet now. We can- we can start again.
Man, that's great. That's just great.
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
You know, it must need to have had its leading from one thought to another. You know what I'm talking about?
It's like Samuel Beckett, you know- I admire the technique but he doesn't... he doesn't hit me on a gut level.
Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion? It's a free country!
Yes.
Sixteen years ago.
Officer, I know what you're gonna say. I'm-I'm not a great driver, you know, I-I have some problems with- with-with-
Stop calling me Max.
Max, the city is terribly worried.
No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.
I have some very good memories there.
There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.
What's the matter?
Well, sit down.
How about a ginger ale?
Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
There are no twos, Max.
M'hm.
They're persecuted enough!
I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
We went over to the swap meet. Annie, Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames.
Oh, yes, that's right. Did you see the new play?
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
Jack.  Did you compose that yourself?
It has your ring.
Can we... one at a time?  Hold it down, and one at a time.  You're last, Cal.
Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?
Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?
Any thoughts on casting yet?
You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
She already has.
Mac?  Oh there you are.  What are you doing, honey?  No more work.  Don't you feel breezy.
Oh.
Well, probably.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
You should have brought him.
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
Let's get the kids.
Thanks for coming.
Directing suits you.
I saw Lucy when I was in London, she seems okay.  It's hard to tell with her.
So?
What is it?
And?
Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.
And you know our friends, how?
Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my brave hero?
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close.
What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London, it's an outrageously expensive city.
What was it?  What the fuck was it?
No.  Did you?
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
In the kitchen.
Well, not yet.  The gate was open?
Okay, knock it off.
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come!
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
About me!
Anyone else?
You think this was to hurt you?!  My God, Joe.  It isn't about you.
Don't make allowances.  I'll never be ready.  Some people just shouldn't have children.  I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe.  I did want it for us.  But I couldn't do it.  I don't really think I can do it.
I can't got tonight.  I don't want to be on a plane on my own tonight.
I don't want to go tonight.
Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I don't understand you.  And I don't think I ever understood Lucy.  I don't understand throwing it away.  How do you throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I want the possibilities.  And all kinds of crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  All the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it.  We'd have had amazing children, you and me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have surprised yourself.  I'll never love anybody else, you know.
I know.
Has she called?
We have a gift?
Yes, she is.
Yes.
Not long.
I'm a little nervous, so...
Oh shit.  I'm sorry.
Lemon or raspberry?
It's really not the same thing.  He was really nicer when he drank.
He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better.
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.
I didn't say a word.
How's he doing?
Ryan.
Well, yes, actually.
I love it here.  Don't you love it here, Ryan?  I love it here.  And I love tonight.  And I love these people.  And this feels utterly fantastic, Ryan.  Utterly fantastic.
I don't need a drug.
Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!
I'm sorry.
I...
And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality.
The charades.
The Shostakovich.
Are you lovesick?
She's even better looking in the flesh.
How?
Fuck you, Panes.
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
It's our anniversary, Panes.
Everyday.
You're a shit.
That's it?  Yes.  Fine?
Um.  Happy for you.
So tell me, how's it going?
Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much.  We keep him in at night.
Oh my God!  America told me your neighbors are coming?
She's such a great photographer.
You are not having your baby in London. You're going to have your baby at Cedars in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by Dr. Milton Cohen.  Period. And you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that Lamase bullshit.  There's no excuse for pain like that.
Don't try and change the subject.  Oh God, it feels great!  He's just a little narcissistic, irresponsible and unreliable.
Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
Tell me about it.
He's...he's dead.  You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis.
The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up!
Uh oh.  Goodbye!  Gotta run!
That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
Out here I'm just what?
So what makes you so special?
Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have walked halfway across the world by now!  How did I get into this mess...
Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know....
Come on, Z.
The Club's so <u>stuffy</u>.  I want to try someplace different.
Of course --
BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.
What are you doing?!  ATTACK!!  Come on, you yellow-bellies!  Don't just stand there, Carpenter! Make an example of yourself!
Lays it on a little thick, doesn't he?  If you ask me, he's one giant bore.
What's this?  A <u>worker</u> has been masquerading as a war hero?!
General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...  Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth!  Ship 'er out.  What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
Yes, what else?
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now <u>dig</u>!
You sure this is a good idea? DOBISCH Can't think of a better one.
Not there.  Under the mat.
Beatnik! Go to my kitchen -- third drawer, under the good silver, there is napkins.
Good night.
This date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious?
Well, don't tell the fellows in the office about the appendix. They may get the wrong idea how you found out.  'Bye.
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops. I mean, decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise.  Cheers.
By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order.  Shall we join the natives?
Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
Well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me -- how about the three of us going out this evening -- you and me and the bowler -- stroll down Fifth Avenue -- sort of break it in --
Here.
Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
And where are you now?
There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
What do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents?
Cut.
Too slow?
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
I don't like myself very much anyway.
Do I have to?
It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
I would.
-- Mr. Sheldrake.
Are you all right?
In this house, you're supposed to.
What are you doing with that?
Yes, you are,  When I was straightening up the couch, you know what I found? Six hairpins, a lipstick, a pair of false eyelashes, and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
Here.
Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
Shall I light the candles?
You know what we're going to do after dinner?
I mean, after that?
Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?
How's everything at the apartment?
Some weather we're having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?
I was sort of wondering what you looked like. Sit down.
Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?
Oh.
Baxter, an insurance company is founded on public trust. Any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming --  How many charter members are there in this little club of yours?
Where is your apartment?
This?
Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that cold --
Not that I have anything to hide.
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
Hello? -- yes -- what's on your mind, Baxter?
No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a matter of fact, I've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars --
You left your wife?
My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
Baxter?
How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?
Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA  It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.
You're on your way up, Buddy-boy. And you're practically out of liquor.
Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
That Kubelik -- boy!  Would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China.
A lot of guys around here have tried it -- all kinds of approaches -- no dice.  What is she trying to prove?
Say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us?
Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
I sympathize with your problem -- and believe me, I'm very sorry --
Buddy-boy, that's the worst thing you can do. If you got a cold, you should go to a Turkish bath -- spend the night there -- sweat it out --
Quite an office -- name on the door -- rug on the floor -- the whole schmear.
Yeah.  Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
There's a girl in my place -- she took some sleeping pills -- you better come quick -- I can't wake her up.
Help yourself.
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
What's this -- you packing?
Can you use a bottle of champagne?
'Twas the night before Christmas And all through the house Not a creature was stirring -- Nothing -- No action -- Dullsville!  You married?
Family?
A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
Poor Mickey -- when I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana --  -- want to see his picture?
Say, this is Snugsville.
Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
Not so rough, honey.
-- so yesterday afternoon I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and guess who he's got stashed away in the bedroom?
Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?
Dreyfuss.
And what happened to you?
Do you know where you are, Fran?
Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
What for?
Hi. How's the branch manager from Kansas City?
How long has it been -- a month?
That's enough, Fran.
You're not being funny.
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
Oh -- I see -- Well, girls, this is Captain -- eh --
Look -- you know who that is, Captain -- you know what she's saying -- you'll never see stuff that good outside of a magazine for the rest of your life.
Good -- like I said, take your pick.
How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think --
Chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff?
Captain -- they've been probed all this week -- Cong and NVA regulars. There's gonna be a big offense any time.
You forgot the mangoes, didn't you?
Elevate Lance, in the tree. No, I saw another.
I met the P.B.R. crew; they were pretty much all kids, except for Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson -- Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef -- Radio Operator Second Class T. Miller; they called him Mr. Clean.
All right with me, I used to drive a taxi.
Smoke !
Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there. Hueys, lots of 'em.
They're not Cong.
Who knows? Right.
Forget that extra drum -- it's too damn hot.
I only met Kurtz once.
Our Recon flight ?
Touchy.
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
Do me a favor buddy, please.
It's to everyone I really knew -- the first girl I screwed -- my brother -- best friend -- I wanted to tell 'em how much I enjoyed knowing 'em -- it's been a great twenty years. I gotta let 'em know.
How did they know?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Yeah.
This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument.
Upriver? Why upriver? There is nothing there, only jungle.
I guess this is whAt men of war do -- eh?
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
It's an honor to meet you Lance. I've admired your nose-riding for years -- I like your cutback, too. I think you have the best cutback there is.
The wind --
Mike, you know anything about the point at Vin Drip Drop?
Change -- get out there -- I want'a see if it's ridable -- change.
Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th Recon Group -- I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence 11 Corp -- I believe you understand the nature of my mission.
Don't you agree?
No -- I don't want to sleep. I want to think. Water. Give me water.
Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.
How did we get here?
And you admired him?
Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.
Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out.
Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz.  You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.
But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.'
Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?
So that's it.
What if I say no.
Hard to work up an interest in politics, way we live.  You're the first people we've seen in two weeks.
34   CONTINUED:
You talk about ecology -- there it is.
First you save my ass, now you want to kill me.  Make up your goddamn mind.
113  CONTINUED:
165  CONTINUED:  
26   CONTINUED:
My dad was a Navy doctor.
How did she..?
What about you -- why come back? Classy girl like you seems more suited to the finer things.
-- Get this straight: I'm the District Supervisor.  Whatever you do reflects on me.  It wasn't my idea to bring you people up here, but I'm stuck with you. You are absolutely not to involve yourself in any local disputes. Whichever side you take, you alienate the other.  Mr. Corbett is quite well-known in this region.  People admire him --
Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
Great idea -- pointing a lousy dart gun at some nut with a high-powered hunting rifle.
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
You're hurt.
Does he have people?
Surviving is what I know --
Been driving long?
Sure love to know where you fit in up here.
Stay still.
I'm hungry.  Go kill me some dinner.
Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.
I already have.
Talk to that good-looking girl of yours?
Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.
Snow's to their advantage, kid. You can't see them, but soon as that plane comes, they'll sure as hell know where we're going. Wise up.  Take me to the Yukon. I'll give you that money and guarantee you'll walk away.
What's wrong?
Neff, you know better than this...
Nobody wants any more killings; we all agree to that, correct?  That's good.  Now, Eric, you're gonna hand your prisoner over to us.
Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
Dead.  Trappers killed him.
Go easy.
I ain't gonna leave a seven- hundred-dollar Remington behind.
...Ben never sent a signal.
You're not still writing that thank-you note?
What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."
You know he's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in.
I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll get back to work today?
The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
Getting loud, getting loud.
So. Anything else?
Okay.
Lovely.
I can't. I work.
Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.
Thanks, Melvin.
So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
You don't owe me that.
I don't want to hear that music right now.
Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home.
That seems like a good choice.
I should've danced with you.
Grouchy?
Boyfriend?
Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.
No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
Do you want to know what happened with my parents?
I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
What the heck are those for?
I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
Simon, you've got to get dressed.
Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
Simon's home. I was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust...
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
She's nice.
Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.
Actually, I don't think so.
Sorry. What are those cards?
Terrify me?
The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
Is he dead yet?
Sure thing.
Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.
No, I didn't.
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well.
Please, just leave.
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
Good-bye.  Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.
Picking on me won't help.
Is there a problem?
That was Peterson back there.  That goes to the expressway for the airport.
Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus fucking Christ!
Listen to me, Bain.  Two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where I was going to pick up the transferred money from MicroCell. You don't know how they got the information.  It bothered you, but you didn't care.  How do I know this?  Because ten years ago, I was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now.
Five million dollars?
Game over, bitch!
They money will be standard bank transfer.  We believe we will know where and when.
Where have you been, Robert?
Send the file.  I'll have the estimate tonight.
I have been sitting on a contract from Cleveland for six days because of you.
Get on the expressway.
An assassin?
Someone hired both of you?
Don't tell me I don't have a choice!
Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --
Oh Jesus Jesus...
No.
Had?
Some people said that.  I never thought so.
Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
My first take?
Why?
I've never been to the Gulf of Mexico.  Is it as nice as they say?
That's where he'll be.
What will you do if this works, if we get the money?
I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.
Breakfast.
You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.
What?
Ten years ago.
What did he say?
What are you doing?
That's a ridiculous move.
Because, I'll take it.
Attraction is a complication?
Is this becoming complicated?
Wait until he is on the stairs.
That's okay, hon, I always expect the unexpected.
Do you ever regret things you've done?
But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
Do you think about their wives or their families?
Do you ever think about starting over?
Yeah.
You wish to close this account today?
How would you like the funds?
Of course, senor.
Fresh from the shrink I'd say!
You guys having a go a me or what?
Anything in it?
Just because they've got a choice of four McDonalds, doesn't mean they can afford a cheeseburger.
Puppet theatre, don't you need something a little bigger?
Just two things. What do I use to shift the stuff and where in hell am I gonna put it all?
Yep, except a name for this place.
Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?
No, why?
I've been saying that since we met.
It must be on the other side of this.
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit?
We'd better get some booze in for tonight.
Here, let's both put in two hundred crowns. That should get nine or ten bottles of wine.
I see, you've got your hands too far up your collective arse to pull it out long enough except to drink my bloody wine.
Couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?
She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
Now you're using that word.
Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.
It was all in Czech wasn't it.
God, I think I need a holiday.
Yeah, no problem.
I made a deal with Josh.
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
Date of birth, November the fourth nineteen-sixty-two.
So why don't you get up and speak something, then we will see who is crazy.
Well, get me and Chris a drink then.
Doug you said you wouldn't be long. Come on, I've got to go. Now!
She's tired.
I think I'm stupid.....All you do is use me and expect me to wait for you.
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
I thought for sure they would catch me.
I don't understand, it's your home?
Yeah, for sure.
Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.
Yes, it's looks good.....We will use this for the soundtrack and we will have two guys up there with the spotlights. The others will just be house lights.
Okay?
Yes, of course...maybe one hour.
Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!
And take Jiri with you?
Will this thing take long?
Why are you doing all this, what for?
A champion of lost causes huh?
We_re not all running away
Shall I wash these out?
Is it dry?
Who you saving the dishes for?
Did you take your things over to my place?
Run into Josh?
You will wish you hadn't.
Why did you break into that particular building?
And the students?
Central station, locker number 139 - combination JFK.
That's okay I like the metro, it's only a couple of stops from here.
And a fifty foot extension lead?
All I'm saying Honey is run the thing past me for Christ's sake before you get up and broadcast the crap.
You are quite sure it's secure?
So, who is in the building?
And there has been enquiries from the American Embassy maybe they are involved?
She's coming over here...
You saw him?
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
Were you with Jamie?
Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities.
You do. You're handsome and charming.
But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ?
I'm thinking.
Deranged.
Belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real.
I'm very sorry --
I don't make small talk --
Can't you have a normal conversation?
You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --
I know. Don't say anything.
Saturn. Beautiful.
Do you believe you'll see your mother again?
I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet --
Yeah.
You're not in a very good mood.
Or anywhere where people might see us.
I don't want to be just your friend --
It's a start.
Before we do this.
How do you know this place?
So what do you want to see?
Are you trying to seduce me?
What's the best thing I can see tonight?
Can you locate XXI5639I?
You're going to take a year off? Join the Peace Corps -- ?
Are you frightened?
Help me live until I die?
What are you thinking?
'Love is always patient and kind. It is never boastful or conceited -- '
How're you doing?
Can I -- go out?
Will you do something for me?
By accident --
I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God!  I don't even know where to put all my anger.
When Mom died you told me God wanted her more, loved her more --
Apropos of nothing... so. So so so so --
I'd like to take Jamie to dinner on New Year's Eve.
We didn't tell him any different for years --
I've almost finished the rocker. Did she order mirrors?
Like you'd make it to June. Even cutting half your classes, you have a B- average.
Besides attending all your regular classes, I'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school --
Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
So what did we just make?
What's N.R.C.?
Huh?
You remember me...?
George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!
Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance?
Oh yeah.
No, Chinese food is fine.
You've gotta ask her to the dance!
Oh, no! That was for the cafeteria! This is different!
How many times do I have to explain it to you?... We know you're not a fighter. You know it, I know it... but she doesn't know it. That's why we gotta make you look like a fighter, somebody who'll stand up for her, somebody who isn't chicken. And you're not gonna look like a fighter if you can't hit me in the stomach.
Okay. So right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me -
Why what?
You mean, you're gonna --
You'd like to see a nuclear holocaust?
Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
Operator...
Sir, it only costs a nickel.
Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.
What, am I radioactive or something?
Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
Professor Brown! It's almost eight thirty -- I'm outta here!
But Professor --
Marty, that would alter history.
Professor? Professor Brown?
Well, there's a mall here now -- I mean, there will be.
Professor. Well, not exactly, Professor. You see, we don't point it at the sun.
I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
Let me put it on a level you can understand. You don't belong here. You don't know anything about this world. You don't know the customs, you don't know how to talk, how to act -- you don't even look like you belong here. And if you walked out on the street, you wouldn't get 100 yards without being arrested. Then there would be questions, and where would we come up with the answers?
The test is this Monday! 15 megatons... Let's see, we need 4200 rads...  You'd have to be...exactly 800 yards from ground zero... You realize that what we're going to do could be extremely dangerous.
My guess is that she turned him down.
That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
There's no way of knowing.
You see, I never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. I decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky. Anyway, experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of Cuba caught Dr. Felstien fooling around in the Bermuda Triangle -- that was back in '64.
But if you didn't rebuild the time machine, how did I go back in time in the first place?
Obviously!  
Sweet and what?  Maybe you'd better pay for this first.
...He just lets himself get pushed around all the time! People walk all over him and he never fights back, never stands up for himself.
What did you do to your hair?
You promise to stay down there for an hour?
How you doing, Cato?
That's what he told you, huh?
Does he bite?
We did it, Ray.
Well, Kit...
You know, before I met her, nobody could ask me how I was doing with my girl. Matter of fact, I didn't really have one.
Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like "druthers", doesn't it?
Hi.
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
Can I come around and see you tomorrow?
Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
Is that all there is to it?
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
Are you sure?
Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it.
Why not? I mean, I'm having fun... At least I'm not bitching.
What?
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
Hi.
Sorry to barge in on you. Anybody else here besides you two?
Hi, whatcha doing?
Fine.
Hi.
All these people applied for drivers' licenses in the same town in New Jersey on the exact same date.
November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it?  Orson Welles!
Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo.  Casper Lindley, Knight of the Blue Shield, at your disposal.  And my son, Scooter.
Not me. No way.
Planet 10?
The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was orange...
You're a welcome sight...
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
Does this thing have guns, John Parker?
And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield.
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...
Go away.  Let me rot?
You.  Like the papers all say.
Was she pretty?
Another 'you'?
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
Stay here, I'll be back.
What? A black ship?  Where?  A black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.
Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
Not here!  No Overthruster!
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
Better see what's keepin' the boss, Reno.
We're waiting for the Jet Car.  Billy's bringing it.
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight?
That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you.
...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him!
...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
If you could, I'd –
Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
Yes, I'm afraid I have.
Well... THIS.
Before what?
Could you come back later?  It's just...  too hot... My head is killing me.
I beg your pardon?
...A little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink?
...Still, I must say. I haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. Don't you find it so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?
What's that?
I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum said I should drop by morning to see you about the –
...Huh? No, I'm –
I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.
...Look, you're confused? You need guidance? Talk to another writer.
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
Souse! Souse! He manages to write his name on the back of his paycheck every week!
I didn't say anything-
I can't write anything by tomorrow.
...Look, they love you, kid – everybody does. You see Caven's review in the Herald?
...What is it Barton? Are you okay?
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
You don't say. That's a tough racket. My hat's off to anyone who can make a go of it. Damned interesting work, I'd imagine.
...In spite of what you might think from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.
Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?  Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and – and – and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?
Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man – from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and – and – and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and – well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
...Probably sounds a little grand coming from someone who's writing a wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.
...All right now, when I say "Ready... wrestle!"  you try and pin me, and I try and pin you. That's the whole game. Got it?
How did you know about that?
You're leaving?
...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is this?  What're we gonna do?
I believe you, brother, but this don't look good.
Jesus... You're leaving.
It's more than I've got.
...Where did we put him?
Mr. Lipnik, I –
Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider –
Fink.
...I was commissioned yesterday in the Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau arranged it. He's a dear friend.
Yes sir.
Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives.
Good luck with no fuckin' head.
Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.
Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say anything you might remember could be helpful. But I'll be frank with you: That is not helpful.
We got a call from Berkeley P.D. There was a killing.  A professor. Icepick.  In his bed.  Multiple stab wounds.  1977.
Take care, you hear?
You're on leave, man.  You're on psycho leave.  I'm talking to a possible whacko here.
The boat blew.  There was a leak in the gas line.  There were two previous repairs.  There was a five-mil policy on both of 'em.  A real heavy investigation.  Zilch. Goose-egg.  It was an accident.
Yes.
I need a cigarette.
It's a confidential psychiatric record, it'd be illegal --She backs into a wall.  She looks very scared. He comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall.
What do you want, Nick?
I had him in two classes.
What are you doing here?
Did I miss something?
Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him.
Even though you were fucking him.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
I like you.
You're not easy to figure.  I'm just very good at figuring.
Why does he do it?
Yes.
How about Roxy?  Is she a fuck to the century, too?
How's your shoulder?
You shouldn't play this game.
It's OK.  It's OK.
Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?
I just thought I'd surprise you.  What's the matter?
I'm writing a book.
I hate rugrats.
Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?
What kind of talk?
He had a girlfriend?
How'd it go, son?
Was she ever suspect?
You think I --
I don't think it's funny.
Everybody that she plays with dies.
What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.
I'm not afraid of her.
Maybe the maid did it.
Are you kidding me?
I love it.  She's got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.
Now what?
We're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some --
How old was she when this happened?
Anderson.  Jack W. Donald M.  I'm sorry.  No Lisa.
Hey – it's the big A.M..
When's your show?
Naa..
Of what?
No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every day. That I got sick of.
You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks.
Yeah... Like – stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors – anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"
Let's leave this town and go someplace. Some island.
What's with the wigs?
After the show we should take a nice long vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to give up painting and start playing music again. I wanna sing.
Is Jean Michel here?
It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.
Yes, I understand – but where do you take them from?
What are they?
Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in you? Any anger in your work?
Yeah.
You want me to put it here?
It's Maria Portos. What should we do?
Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
Hey – Willie Mays.
You got a date already?
What're you doing? You're doing something.
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
What's wrong with me?
So. Are you ready? I start Columbia next fall. Of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but – whatever. I'm really excited.  And: Rene gave me a job as his secretary. His poems are getting published.
Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole.  Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're –
I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
Hi.
What? Wait a minute... talk to me.
What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it.
Uh huhh... Band practice?  It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...?
You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true.  There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?
So shut up and keep painting..
'Phillips head,' right?
Man, I was up on him years ago on the IRT.
It's cold.
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
A "he-man"?  Sure.  They shine that beacon in the sky, then wonder what hole I crawl out of.
We've met.
Sorry.  I mistook me for somebody else.
Didn't I say that?
I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
You're not coming to that, are you?  "The Relighting of the Tree" thing?
And the truth frightened her?
I, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
We're gonna disassemble his spiffy old Batmobile, then reassemble it as an H-bomb on wheels.  Capiche? Yesterday's victor is tomorrow's vapor.
Me, domesticated?  By you?  I doubt it!  You repulsive... awful... <u>penguin</u>.
Son!
You buy this "blurry" business?
Ten, nine...
A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference.  By the way, how's Fred Adkins, your old partner?
Max!  Relax!  Josh and Jen'll put a spin on this.  We'll talk it over tonight, at your costume par--
I don't.  So, no.
Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
And a very, very good one.
It's our secret.  Honest.  How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
Okay, go ahead.  Intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big.  I mean, it's not like you can just kill me.
You certainly will not.
Find my brother Wilfred.  Give him This.  I have duties he must fulfill in my stead.  Only family can be trusted.
You have?
Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-
But I can't can I?
Have you ever regretted your life working here, Alfred?
I've spent my whole life trying to beat back death.  What good are all my heroics now if I can't save you?
It's good to see you.
Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
Advanced botany.  DNA splicing. Recombinant animal plant patterns. Pheromone extractions.
What is it?
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
I could have made it, you know.  I didn't need your help.
Alpha.  Got it.  What the hell is attack plan Alpha?
Crimefighter's rule number two.
After you have frozen, your icy tomb will plummet back to Gotham.
... A giant drilling truck burrowing under the city ...
Watch the first step.
If we could relay the sunlight-
What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
Tell me, billionaire, would you warm faster to my pleas if I looked more like Ms. January here?
Julie, I'm not the marrying kind. There are things about me you wouldn't understand.
Dr. Isley.  it was like I could feel you in the room.  You're...enchanting. Gorgeous.  The most beautiful woman I've ever seen.  If you're..um... free...this evening.
What happened to his wife?
Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
Of course.  Alfred still keeps your mother's picture in his room.
He's dying.  And I can't deal with it.
You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
My reserves are exhausted.  I must have the gems that power my suit.
One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?
Give it up.  If you threw yourself-
Dr. Isley?  Pamela?  You look great. Especially for a dead woman.
The dreams again, sir?
Do you remember the night I fell into that cave and the bat chased me?
Gee, I'm not sure.  Alfred? How many rooms? Total?
Maybe they're right.
What do maniacs always want?
How about, MR. E.
...dual personalities. Abnormal psychology. Washington's poster child for the criminally insane. I read your work.
I haven't had much luck with women...
I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?
Mr...?
We'll talk some other -
I notice you've sub-divided your B coupons. Feeling a little light on principle?
How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?
What do you know about obsession?
It's a stretch but I'll manage.
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
Touchy, touchy.
...Not the bat?
Me and my brother Chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that? Two-Face took...everything. Now I can pay him back.
Chase?
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world? My RES Box will give Joe Q Public a realm where he is king.  Not that someone like you would need it. Someone so intelligent. Witty. Charming. But for the lonely, the...
No.  Wait...
A-14.
B-12.
You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
How long's it been, Alfred? A quarter of a century?  It seems like yesterday. I guess we ended up doing more harm than good.
Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.
You know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously.
Look! Police!
...Not even a 'thank you'?
I'll have to ask you for that film.
... How long have I been out?
It doesn't protect your head, though.
How'd you find this place?
They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source.
No.
Odd desire for anyone.
Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
Got it all figured, huh?  Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins.  -- Maybe he don't know what we know.
There was no blood, man.  My brother says... all the bad things you done... they come back and haunt you...
Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
And what happens if we say no?
That's it?
All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --
God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.
Where does one man get all this junk?
Are they paying you for all this?
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.
Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope.  CRAZY BAT-STARD!
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
And what did you say?
It's the last thing we need.
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
Shut up, Kevin.  Honey, you-re not making sense ...
I know you are.  Very serious ... most of the time these days.
Sort of half.....
0 my god.
shhh...
Maybe I ought to think about getting another job.
Excuse me.  Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you upstairs.
David.  There's a call for you.  It's your wife.
Ah, Mr Bean ...
Better go.  Grierson hates people being late.
I was hoping DU.  Bean might take a look at my computer project today.
And howls Alison?
It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie - always a subtle joy.
Great day.  At last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future.
Everything okay, David?
He's just parking the Governor's car.
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ...
The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.
Brilliant, huh?  I already have a prospective buyer - the current Governor of California, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal.  Spread the news.  I think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't you?
All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day- Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish.  Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh.  Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.
Honey, calm down now... it's okay...
Well, there is that ...
... in the distant future.
what a pleasure, Governor.  Welcome.
Interesting suit.
Dammit, Beavis, I was about to score. Huh huh.
Whoa! I think I just figured something out Beavis.
What a dork. Huh huh.
Huh huh huh. I'm ready for love.
Ow, let go, Butt-Head!
This is it, Beavis. Huh huh. We're finally gonna score.
Damn, huh huh.
Hey, where'd those chicks go?
Huh huh huh. Settle down Beavis.
I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh.
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
Cigarettes and beer rule! Huh huh.
Bunghole...
Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!
Uh, we didn't score yet.
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to fall into the wrong hands...
What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?
Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't as sweet as she looks. She stole everything from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
This is Travis and Bob... What's your last name, dear?
Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
Shut up, dumb-ass! You didn't score. I scored with both of them...
Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.
Oh no.
I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I don't think we survived that crash.
What?
Handbook for the recently diseased.
I don't think we survived the crash.
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!
Oh, honey, we may need that.
We're trapped in this house forever... with those... people.
That little girl saw us.
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
There's nothing we can do.  It's just a matter of time before they unlock this room.  There goes my model.  There goes our last refuge.
... Not what I expected when we walked through that door.
My God, we're back where we started.
I feel really stupid.
Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?
I guess we open it.
And your sushi was remarkable.
N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
You know, I've been thinking.  I could teach Lydia to sew.
A... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?
What?
We weren't there.  The handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.
What is going on?
Wait for who?
<u>So</u> you, the dead, want me, <u>the</u> <u>undead</u>, to throw the live guys -- Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who might not mind a tumble with an older guy, out into the cold? Even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump?
<u>Don't say his name</u>!  Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!
Handbook?  When...?
Yes... or no?  Do you want the Deetzes out or in?
Just get some people out of our house.
Folks, be reasonable here.  I'm at your service.  You be the judge. I'm a harmless guy.  Try me.
I'd nearly given up on you.  I was about to leave.  I do have other clients.
If... we have trouble.  What about the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...
No, you don't!  He does not work well with others.
Tell the truth.
We can't.  We haven't left the house since the funeral.
So, <u>never</u> let Beetle Juice out. Never.  Besides...  We're thinking about letting everyone stay... You and your father and mother can stay too.
Hi, Barb!  I'm glad I caught you. I heard you were on vacation!
Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything ... it's just too big for you two. I know these things.
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
So... You're ready for me now?
Can you help <u>me</u>?
Your qu...?  But you're...
I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan?
Otho'll know what to do.
What do you think, honey?
Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest --
I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.
We'll be <u>the</u> art center of summer New York.  I'll teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture.  And when Otho and I get through with this house, you people are not going to recognize it.
What do you think?
Blue-green!  Hydrated chromic oxide!  Remember I'm schooled in chemistry.  I was a hair analyst! Briefly.  Interior design is a <u>science</u>, Delia!  Think of me as Doctor Otho.  And this patient is truly <u>sick</u>!
Now, Lydia... Favor us about your ghosts.
Look at that <u>detail</u>!
What's happening to them?
Otho, that's terrible.
All presences have a home space. A place where they live, so to speak.  Where do they hide out?
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
I would like to walk today.
I know exactly what you mean. Today the businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they want to do is regulate our natural growth! It's happening across the country!
Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.  ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.
... He walked off...
... Do you think we should look for him?
We have to find him, Robert - he could be lost, something may have happened, we can't leave him!
... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act?
A Black man gave me the message.
... Won't you let us do something for you? Your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital.
Would you care for a drink?
Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.
Yes... I know, Chauncey.
Chauncey!
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
... You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you?
... Good night, Chauncey.
I know...  ... So are you, Chauncey ...  ... Do you mind my being here, like this?
I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.
To watch...? To watch me...?
Dearest, you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me, and when you watch me my passion dissolves it. You set me free. I reveal myself to myself and I am drenched and purged.
Chauncey! Chauncey!
Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation's economic crisis.
Do you like it?
I see.
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
I feel very good in here.
No, thank you. My house has been closed.
Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.
Bravo!
No, Ben.
I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
Well, that's good news, my boy.
I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.
He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he?
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.
Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
... Sir?
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
I am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the Old Man's suits. They all fit me very well. I can also take his shirts, shoes and coats.
Let's have a look, do you mind?
... My suitcase.
How long do we stay in here?
... That is a very small room.
... Well, ain't you the gentleman this mornin'...  ... gotta go now, Chance...
I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
Come now, Mr. Gardiner, before his speech at the Financial Institute the President consulted with you and Benjamin Rand, did he not?
Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good?
Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.
... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate.
Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook?
Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.
No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.
Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
... In the garden?
No headaches?
... Ben, really...
Yes? What have you found?
What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week?
I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
... Gentlemen, I quoted this man on national television today he is obviously a financial sophisticate of some reknown.
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
Sorry to disturb you, chief but we have new developments.
Ben!
I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
You take care too, Bobby.
Malkovich.
Thank you.
I don't know.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
What?
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
I was worried.
The iguana.
I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
I have to go back, Craig. Being inside did something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I was.
What, are you nuts? That's Oprah talking.
How was it?
I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
What are you doing?
You've always hated the animals.
What about Maxine?
Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
The monkey.
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
Holy shit, yes!
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Sure, after a fashion.
You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
Yex?
Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid I’m in love with somebody else.
Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.
Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually.  In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
Yeah.
Why not?
That's the usual?
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
Tickets to Malkovich?
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
I've fallen in love.
Lotte? Is that you?
Hi. Wendy! What're you up to in this vacant office.
Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
Thank you, Floris.
But of course.
But why, Son of Malkovich?
You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
Yes?
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
We have to meet.
How do we do that?
Never heard of it.
I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
Thanks so much for coming over.
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.
Darling!
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
Stay in him forever?
No one would ever have to know its not him.
You've got to be kidding.
Why you never go back to Lady Jone's and learn your letters? You liked going there I remember. Seeing the other children. Then all a sudden, you stop.
You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
...All I remember is how she loved the bottom of burned bread. Her little hands...I wouldn't know 'em if they slapped me".
I had another dream last night.  The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
I want somethin' sweet.
Well, if you want my opinion...
What you want'em for?
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
She likes to see you off in the morning.
DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH.
Morning.
Mama let me help you.
What you want there? Somebody invite you in?
You know he's colored? What else there to know?
Sethe. He took up with her and stayed in there and you don't want nothing to-
Till she showed herself.
I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.
Jesus.
You don't know what I think.
Leave off..
Sethe?
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
What the hell you thinking, girl? Strolling in here this late?
Not too sweet! You make it too sweet they don't eat it.
Yeah?
We've had some terrible news.  Mr. Lebowski is in seclusion in the West Wing.
Here's the money, and the phone. Please, Dude, follow whatever instructions they give.
Her life is in your hands.
This is our concern, Dude.
I know my rights.
Can we just rent it from you?
Don't need it.  We're scattering the ashes.
Yeah.
Where you going, Dude?
Almost five!
What tied the room together, Dude?
What--
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
What do you need that for, Dude?
Those are good burgers, Walter.
Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
--had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man--
Please!  Please!
That's the key to the city of Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was given two years ago in recognition of his various civic, uh.
No, they--
Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though.  Or the Creedence tapes.
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?
Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I gotta get back.
Of course you do.  I can see you're anxious for me to get to the point. Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?
I've heard the kidnapping story, so save it.  I know you're mixed up in all this, Dude, and I don't care what you're trying to take off her husband.  That's your business.  All I'm saying is, I want mine.
Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
Is that what that's a picture of?
Lord.  You can imagine where it goes from here.
Yeah, but my-
She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's--
I was, uh, one of the authors of the Port Huron Statement.--The original Port Huron Statement.
Finder's fee?
We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.
Well...no, of course not--
No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu. A real reactionary. . . So your father. . . Oh man, I get it!
State of Israel.  If you will it, Dude, it is no--
Walter, they're calling the cops, put the piece away.
Huh.  I did not know that.  Well, it's water under the bridge.  And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong?
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
Huh.
I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless.  I mean she probably kidnapped herself.
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
The what?
We?  What the fuck we?  You said you just wanted to come along--
Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a fucking game, Walter--
Oh shit.  Walter.
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
FUCK.
Wooden bridge, huh?
You didn't think I was rolling out of here naked!
Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?
Walter--
It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!
I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is--
Lady, I got buddies who died face- down in the muck so you and I could enjoy this family restaurant!
I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off.
Yeah.
Who the fuck is that?
Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?
Yeah.
Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard of Vietnam?
I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man!  He's had enough!  He no longer digs her!  It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks?  I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.
Walter, come off it.  You're not even fucking Jewish, you're--
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
Oh, shit.
It's a heart attack.
Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking asshole!
Dude, this is Smokey.  Look, I don't wanna be a hard-on about this, and I know it wasn't your fault, but I just thought it was fair to tell you that Gene and I will be submitting this to the League and asking them to set aside the round.  Or maybe forfeit it to us--
Shut the fuck up.  Hello?
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just--
Employed?
Is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing?  Whatever the price?  Isn't that what makes a man?
Mind if I smoke a jay?
Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.
Who the hell is he?
Oh, shit.
Walter--
You happy, you crazy fuck?
Tom here's my ninth hard felon of the month. Six weeks he'll be sucking gas. In three years I'll be working Central Warrants. Jewboy Deputy D.A. over there wets his pants for fighters. Promised me the next spot he can wangle.
What?
Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
How does it look?
What do you really think?
He's right.  They'll smell that you're human.  Stay here, watch our backs.
I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.
It has been said, you may have enemies whom you hate, but not enemies whom you despise.  Be proud of your enemy: then his success shall be yours, too.  In that regard, I should thank you.
You got something in mind, Blade?
Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.
So you're going to do this?
Hey, hey!  The fuck you doing?!
What the fuck you doing?
We're locked in.
Yes?
An inevitability, I suppose.  Nyssa was not among them, I trust.
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
Tell me something, Skid --
Stupidity.
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
You're too human, Blade.
Hold out your hands.
This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.
Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the Thirst.
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself.
What are you looking at?
Graffiti --
Like what?
I made a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment.
Is he sick?
It won't work on you.
I can't -- I won't be able to stop --
I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?
But you -- died --
You haven't started in on the internal organs?
-- but then I remember what an ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back to reality.
Blade. Once again, our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade. He must be destroyed.
The Day Walker represents a unique opportunity. We'd be fools to waste it by killing him.
The shadows suit us, Frost. We've existed this way for thousands of years. Who are you to challenge our ways?
Whistler!
Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst.
--and if she ever did--
'Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the night just ended.
What happened to her, where did she go?
Not that I can see.
No.
Shit? This is from "Josh's Blair Witch Mix," man!
Looks like business is booming.
No.
--brother of Rustin Parr's maternal grandfather, somewhere after 1858--
No offense, sweetheart: fuck you.
You want me to scooch over next to you?
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
Was that you laughing?
Just now?
Then I'm going--
I want to see something!
The clothes--take 'em off-- I want to see every square inch--
You're gonna owe me the rest of your life, bud.
<u>This</u> is what you wanted enhanced?
Beer and weed is what I've got.
I don't know yet.
There, what? I didn't see anything.
So lemme see it.
The witch?
And let it be known--before we even get to Burkittsville--it's gonna be an eighteen thousand times better movie--for half the cost--
You're a complete fucking idiot, aren't you?
From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?
You're not only an idiot, you're a goddamn <u>child</u>.
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
--yeah, a hand or something--
Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--
--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
Cotter?
You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
Where?
Not the place you want to announce your arrival.
What the fuck--??
--f'chrissake, Heather, it's not like the two of us are gonna doze off he leaves for two seconds--
Remember....what Mary Brown said-- she could see the witch's hands on my face, her mouth sucking on mine.
--Cotter--
Was it <u>every</u> day or just semi- weekly you got your ass kicked as a kid?
<u>What</u>?
Just one lock in this neighbor- hood?
--whatever you want, no problem--
How much of that stuff you guys been smoking?
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
--sacred and occult Scotch Tape.
Ripped? They look like they were <u>bit</u> off.
That's almost a year's worth of work!  Scumbags! Oh, Jesus, Jesus....
What's that?
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
What?
Finally got her back to sleep.
Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little--
What?
Gothic rune--the letter "S."
--yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?--
She wants me to talk to you, Heather.
There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.
...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved.
...I mean, I don't know where he is, but he ain't dead.
...Ray?
Who was it?
Uh-huh. So how do you know it was a he?
Nothing. He's like you, he doesn't say much.
When you don't they're usually nice.
...I just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. I took care of everything. Now all we have to do is keep our heads.
...Who?
...But first I gotta know what happened.
You won't have to. I'll explain what a palate is.
...So what're you doing tonight?
He needs a room, Dusty.
What night is it?
...I don't know. Sometimes I think there's something wrong with him. Like maybe he's sick? Mentally?... Or is it maybe me, do you think?
What's the matter?
What "what"?
...Just doin' my job.
Now that don't make much sense.
...What?
...What?
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.
What's this?
The point is we don't serve niggers here.
Howdy stranger.
What day is it today, Angie?
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. goddam!!! This is the suavest guy I know. look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. this beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. it makes me puke.
To your health, Frank.
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
Detective Williams here. yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day. when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though. I can't.
I was the same way when I was you age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
I guess you've seen some bad things.
Why do you do it?
Jeffrey! Come on in.
Okay?
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Hello, baby.
Who's this fuck?
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Shit. You better tell me something.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone . Tell me. Word for word.
Do you like talk like that?
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
Yes.
You can hit me, if you want to.
I liked being with you last night.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. if you need to. come to where I live. O.K.?
Yes.
No. how could he?. Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  . don't hate me.
Do you like my body?
What do you want to do?
I want you to hurt me.
You like to open me. don't you?
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Shut up.
There's no disease, I can tell you.
I'm glad you do.
I guess I should go.
I'll call you.
What?
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
No thanks.
Yeah, how did you know?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I don't want to cause any trouble.
You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
I owe you. since I goofed up this one.
. I wish you wouldn't do this.  It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
Well, how did it go?. What happened?
What did you see?
I'm sorry, I didn't.
Wow. Should you tell my father?
You saw a lot in one night.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
You were late.
You worry about me really?
Everything okay?
Okay.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
You want to dance?
NO.
My father has a gun at home.
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
Probably not. no. Why?
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone. the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
Look Jeffrey.
Are you feeling okay?
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?
On the plane.
Que va hacer?
Nothing like this back home.
Just everything.  You.  California.  The beach.  This spot right here.  I feel like I belong here, you know?  It just feels right.
Are you sure this guy is cool?
You wanna split?
George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years.
Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?
You.  Your responsibility is over.  You do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You are not a distributor.  You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane.  That is all.  You make a percentage.  A generous one.  And you're lucky to get that.
What can I do for you guys?
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
What the fuck is that?
I don't know...
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
And I only deal with you?
I don't think so.
It's nothing personal, George.  Just business.
Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.
I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.
George?  You better get yourself a good lawyer this time.  We're gonna nail your ass to the wall on this one.
What's that?
Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to know my crime?
Oh, come on, George.  If we are to be friends, we must trust each other.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
I know.
Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
Are you comfortable with this?
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
Three years.  How long have we been in business?  Three years.  Does she get to meet your connection?  Was she good enough?
I did not.
Cocaine?  How much?
In how long?  A week?
G-d, son.
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
I just can't get over the size of that ring.  I just love it.  Fred, look at it.  Tell me you don't love that ring.
Layaway shmayaway.
What do I think?  I don't want my answer to be influenced by what I want, so I'm going to have to say I don't know.
I want money.
Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some scotch.
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
So, business is going good.  I've got this import/export thing going on in Miami that's been very profitable.  With my investments...
You're like your mother.  You love money.
No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?
And that FBI agent, Trout?  When he had to get on his knees to put my boots on? You said...
I meant every word of it.
How are you doing, George?
George.
Do I know you?
There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya.
Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem?
What do you want?
I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.
Hey, George.  You okay?
Mirtha, what's going on?  Everything okay with Kristina?
Mirtha, how are you doing?
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.
I don't know.
What?
California, huh?
I don't know.  Maybe California.
I swear.  On my life.
I didn't mean to...
I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know.
Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?
Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?
Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  You take a little and then come back.
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
Okay.  So we need a source.  Where do we start?
Not that far, only halfway.  You sure you know what you're doing?
No shit, Kevin?
Excuse me, colonel. I have the impression that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... my colleagues continue to ask the same allusive questions, to which you can only respond in an allusive manner. I think it would be better to call things by their right names; if one means torture, then one should call it torture.
Second district ... Explain better ...
What "group"?
You afraid of these ...?
Good evening ... Can we pass?
But it's not even midnight yet!
And so the tapeworm no longer has a head. Are you satisfied, Mathieu? In Algiers everything should be over.
Yeah -- I hear they had 'em a real dog and pony show going on up there - -  I'll tell you, sometimes white people are a real puzzle to me.  I mean, did this old guy really think he was gonna be able to keep up with a sweet little number like that?
Joanne Braslow is getting more and more interesting.  I followed her today to an attorney's office. Joseph Koehler.
Here it is!  According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
An inquiry into what?
I think I'm going to make your day.
What was Mr. Marsh's physical condition prior to his death?
Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A.  Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?
What was the nature of the argument?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?
Objection sustained.
No questions.
C'mon -- think about it.  If she was going to kill Marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find?
Why would she want that?
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
She's innocent.
Your Honor, I fail to see what Mrs Crawford's educational background has to do with this case.
Objection!
Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
Her name?
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
How long were you Mr Marsh's personal secretary?
How did he look?
She was here?
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
Mr. Roston, what was your relationship with Miss Lawson?
It's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.
If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
She was.
What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
Did you suggest any?
Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's condition?
I heard him say it.
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
-- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him?
How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?
Yes.
I've tried it.
No.
Yes.
--And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?
Yes.
Three fifteen.
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.
What do you have in your purse?
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
Yes.
Do you think I did it?
Have you ever seen animals make love, Mr. Dulaney?  They have such passion -- such savage emotion.  They struggle, and snarl, and claw, but neither hurts the other.  Not really.
Why not?
When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road.  I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries.  It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes.  The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down.
How'd you meet Marsh?
-- And then?
Can we get out of here?
Hello?
Tell me about Doctor Paley?
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
I called you all weekend.  Where were you?
You were brilliant today.
Can I see you later?
Alright, I'll talk to her
I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.
Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you that you are still under oath.
I can back it up.
If you want me to.
Is that alright, Frank?
What's wrong?
Sharon, it's late.  Can we get to the point?
You wouldn't like what you'd see. You don't know me anymore.  I don't know me anymore.
Albert's got the stomach flu.
Not even if they're a dork?
Let me go!  Godammit, Frank let go!
No, we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died.
It's a beautiful picture of her.
I don't mind waiting.
Lawyer here?
He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?
Yeah.
What?!
"-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. It's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives --
DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?
He's getting her drunk. That's what happened. Jesus, maybe he forced himself. That's why she couldn't tell us.
Mrs. Delaney.  Did you hear the latest?
Not this kind of heat.
Are you from Washington originally?
Oh. When did you move back?
Oh.
Uh... uh...  Umm... long time.
You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
Looking for something in particular? There's not much of a selection.
Everything does. One of the laws of nature. People are always so afraid of change. But if you look at it like it's something you can count on happening, it's actually a comfort. Not many things you can count on for sure.
Then what happened?
My God. How I'd love to see that.
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
Woman friends, too?
Why doesn't it scare you?
Listen, I'm sorry I --
Francesca?
It's Robert.
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
On that one is beautiful. Look at their expressions. As if the camera weren't on them at all. As if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling.
Uh-huh. And?
Where was she?
Am I too heavy for you?
Stop it!
If I've done anything to make you think that what's happened between us is nothing new for me -- is some routine -- then I do apologize.
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
I don't know. Please...
What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
What about your husband?
Franny?
Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.
When did she decide this?
Don't feed that dog.
We can't go back there.  Are you crazy? You saw --
Are you nuts?
Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.  Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
Shit.
Where's the others?
You sure got a way with women, bro.  What happened up there?
Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.  That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure.
Clean your mouth, or I will.  Those boys had no business messing down there.  Go places you're not meant to be -- that's what you get.
You tell my old friend Mackie, I'll be seeing him.  Soon.  Real soon.
Let me see your hand.
Where are we, baby?
'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun.  Get back on the curb!  Now!
It's all arranged for tonight.  Eddie Mack's gonna be there.  And Offisa Korruptsky, too.
Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't you?
You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.
Have you ever been inside?
And what's that?
...I've seen things.  In there.  Last night.  You did too.  Don't tell me you didn't.  You were crying like a baby.
We'll have to sneak in.
Told you so.  Alright.  We tried.  Let's go home.
In his grave there was a cloth or a dress or something.  Covered with blood.
no really, let us help.  We're new in the neighborhood, gonna be neighbors.
I can't.  Not yet.
No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
Patrick, he's...
Here, find my hand.  The stairs are right near here.  I saw them.  Let's just walk up there.
We're here.  Where the hell are you?
But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.  Doing something.  Making it better.
Where are we going?  You know I hate surprises.
Help me.  I'm so sorry.  But please, help me...
You're right.  One of my associates sold the building last month.
Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
No way man...
12-year olds.  They scare easy.  Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash.  Come with me.
Goddamnit!  How many times I told you --
We just thought...
And damp, too.  Let's not forget damp.
Why not?  He eats everything else.
And some people need their medication tweaked.
Not really to live, just to play.
It's not safe down there.  The fire started down there.  The whole thing could collapse.
Illibent?  Who's club is that?
Shit!  Damn dog.  We gonna have to do something about you.
Where is it?
Caesar!
We're family, Caesar.
She's doing the work herself.
Caesar, I'm leaving.
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
Fuck!  Fuck!  How did you ...  Awwww goddammit!
Don't worry, I'll get some more.
They were early.
They just left, didn't they?
That doesn't make any sense.
It's impossible!
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back.
If you're not with me, Violet, then I have to assume you're against me.
It would have been so easy to let him in as you went out.
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
Where is the money?
Stupid cunt!
I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?
How many'd you do?
Where is it?
I'm going to ask you where the money is.  Every time you don't give me an answer, I'm going to cut off one finger.
I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.
That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish someone would help me relax.
I started thinking maybe it's about the money so I call you, but all I get is the busy signal.  I figure the phone is off the hook, that's why I come rushing over here.
You got the key?
See?  We're for real.
Hi.  My name is Violet.  We sort of met in the elevator --
Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this.
No, no trouble.  There's other work to do.
Yeah.
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
Do you know him?
I should be going.  You can drop the cup off anytime.
Thank you so much.  You have to let me pay you something --
Okay, one drink.
Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to seduce you.
I had to see you.
He's a launderer?
We make our own choices and we pay our own prices.  I think we're more alike than you want to admit.
No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw me in a bar with another woman.
I want out.  I want a new life.  I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky.
And where is it now?
That's his brother.
Does Johnnie hit on you?
You can't know for certain that he won't see you.
I still don't see how I'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment.  Everyone will think I did it.
It's me.
Yes.
She's a gypsy.  If it's a cover, it's a great one.
-- he went inside! --
You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think.
Paris.  I live in Paris...
Treadstone.
I don't know.
Keep it. 
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
...yes -- oui -- uh...
D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
Kane.  Do you have Mr. John Michael Kane?
...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?
Was it the break-in?
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
No.  No, I mean, I really don't know who I am.  I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I'm serious.
Look, go ahead...put the radio on...
That's what I'm saying.
When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
Okay, so you're a victim.
So this is it, right?
Look, I don't know what's up there.
This is your office?  God, you live like a monk...
-- no -- Marie -- <u>no</u>! -- it's not like that --
-- just --
Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
-- let me do this, okay? --
-- we'll explain it --
-- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
You have ID?
Where did this body go?
-- we have rules here, this is a very serious place -- I'm the one who decides who gets in here, okay? --
He run away often?
What the hell're you talking about?
Wait a minute --
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
What?
...ergency procedures.
...your ducts?
You telephone, sir.
Trouble with your air-conditioning.
I think we'd better have a look.
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to those critics who maintain that the Ministry Of Information has become too large and unwieldy ...?
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
Too late? That's for me to say.
Gillian Layton?
This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
Sam!
Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
Triplets.
Hello, Jack!
{winking at Sam) She doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really.
Remember how they used to stick out?
I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
Tell me about Layton.
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
It could all be coincidental.
How could you do this to me?
Where do I get it stamped?
Bloody hell! Do as I say!
Where are you taking me?
Where are you taking me?
I mean, it doesn't suit you.
We've got both.
Security.
I was right! Step on it!
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
They're gone.
Oh my God, a mistake!
Isn't it? Whose is it?
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
Try next of kin.
Here. What do I do next?
Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
I never signed the form.
What?
You want to take my console into your office?
Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton.
You remember Samuel, my son.
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
Hello - Central Services - I'm at 579B Block l9, Northwestern Section D - that's exit 1 on Green Pastures Highway at the Orange Blossom Flyover - and I've got trouble with the air- conditioning
Er, don't you want to search me?
I don't know which numero.
I mean it fixed itself.
What?
Hang on! Wait a minute! You can't just go and leave it like this!
Nice and easy now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Ha!!
Well, yes ... and no. Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... Could you hold these.
I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons.  Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row.
You're late, Pierce. I know, but I can't fire you. I've got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls.
No English. She has terrible pain in her belly.
No, no, that's impossible.
Can you walk? Puedes caminar?
No underwear?
It's okay, Kanita. Come on in.
Frank, take it easy. what happened?
Be cool, man. You're having a paradoxical reaction. It can happen.  Didn't I tell you this guy was stressed out?
Frank Pierce.
She wanted something to help her sleep.
I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories.
Twelve Young, I don't have time for your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself?
You're not going to die.
You shouldn't smoke.
I think this place stinks.
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ...
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
This is not a good time.
He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
Rule number one: Don't get involved with patients. Rule number two: Don't get involved with patient's daughters. You understand?
Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you.
Backup?
I hate vodka.
He one of them?
The family know?
No.
Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.
Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it?
Whatja doing?
Whadda we bring?
Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
Mr. Oh.
Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk.
Well why didn't you say so?
Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.
He's crazy.
Hi, Aaron...What's doing?
You want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
You can't talk about feeling intimidated when you're on top of the world.  It's unseemly.
Yes.
This story they won't cover.  And if the network doesn't cover it -- it must not be important so why worry.
He excels at gratitude.
Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
They didn't hire Peter Stiller from the <u>Times</u> and he had a great audition tape.
Nine seconds.
What happened?
Sounds like you may be on to something.
Jesus, Jane.  How long have you been here?
<u>If</u>...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment.
How'd it go?
No.
Do you feel good about it?
Do others feel that you did well?
Then what was good about it?
Don't go.
Aaach...Jane...  Let's take the part that has nothing to do with me.  Let's let me be your most trusted friend, the one that gets to say awful things to you.  You know?
I've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me.
Don't say anything about anything.
Let's go...
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
Do it then.
All this business of war -- do you get scared?
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
I was a little nervous there for a minute.
Jane?
I've got to tell Ernie...because there isn't enough time.
Do you know you're the second woman in network news history to produce?
Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.
Because...
They're not really going to call security are they?
I've been doing some morning show stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't bother me.  I'm in no rush for anything.  It's just the snotty attitude, even if I have it coming, it's still...
No...no.
Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
Is everything all right?
Bye, sweetie.
Jane -- For God's sake...  Look, it's time for you to go to sleep.
Why so glum?
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
It must be nice to always believe you know better.  To think you're always the smartest person in the room.
They said it would be okay if...
I can't believe I'm really here.  No kidding.  If you're through work now --
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn.  I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling having you inside my head.
Jane?
Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
I'm not sure I dialed right -- Jane?
You okay?
Hi, again.  Sorry about...
Hello?
No.  Did he really?
Maybe I haven't been here long enough.  But, hey, congratulations on the promotion.
This is a one-way argument.  We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger deal.  I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here.  The plane's boarding.  You're good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.
I knew what you meant.
Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
That's enough.  That's enough.
That's not true I am a sculptor!
If you were an artist you could have created something!
Listen schmuck, why don't you get out of here and let me go to bed!
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?
That doesn't look like very much clay.
Are you nervous, Walter?
Walter can I ask you something?
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?
Did you hear what he said?
I know what it is to be ignored.
I mean, you look so pretty.
I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?
Hi Walter...
Are you trying to be funny?
Murdered...man?...
It's our road kill series.  I take the pictures.
Well that's not what I pay you for, now is it?
Yeah.
Well...why did you put a knife in it?
Alright, I'll tell you what.  I'll put it in the corner of the alcove. If it sells, we'll split it fifty- fifty.  How's that?
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
You didn't mean to what?
What offers have you got for it? I won't be out-bidded.  I'm a wealthy man and I don't mind paying for something I want.
I was going to make some pancakes, you can have some if you like.
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse!  Junk!  Heroin!
Are you done with these?
I saw your...cat.
An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...
With Dead Cat.  Like a breath of fresh air.  I could just - babble on about it for hours.
A hot light bulb is burning inside of you.  I want to be warmed by it.
I don't think so Mayolia.
What's all the noise in here!
What's wrong with you!?!
I look horrible.
I like it.  Can I be your friend?
... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?
Nice to feel needed.
Buffy!  Looking tasty.
Buffy, this is crazy.  What do these guys want?
No, we didn't.
You're the guys from the movie!
Hey!  She wasted my dog!
Rich bitches.  They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped.
They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
When you get your car together, man, let's bail.
Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!
Did you see a girl come by here?
Excellent.
Your parents are always going away for the weekend.  You're so lucky.
Oh, my God.  Is that true?
Dying.
Buffy, honey?
You okay?
No, you didn't.  When?
You're even weaker than the others.
This?  This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?
Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks. What's your name?
Where are you gonna go?
Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this.
You sure?
It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
He did what he was supposed to.
That's me.
I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.
What are we doing?
Totally stale.  And the ushers are like, the acne patrol.  We're thinking Pavilion.  Sitch?
Let's meet tonight, okay?
God, where the hell did you come from?  You scared me to death.
Why?
Everybody does.
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
How do you know all this?
All right.  What do we do now?
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
Who we gonna beat?
No -- you don't have to --
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
What!?!
You are such a wet.
Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart.  Do you want to live?  Do you?
Five?
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
I wish you would.
I'm curious, is all.
Interesting.
Sooner or later you're going to have to accept it.  Your fate.
None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
Wait!
So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?
That is so cool.
So very much.
What... are you?
No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful.
But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers.  Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called.
Listen, you little worm.  I could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like I did last year, you got that?  You got that?
Oh, yes!  Yes!
Well, I'm done.  Are you done?
I got all the plastic stuff.  What should I do with it?
What happened?
You're kidding.
I never thought of that.
Cool!
The don't.  You kind of wish they would, though.
And the January Semi-formal --
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
How was that?
I'm so proud of you and all the guys.  Want some more soup?
How 'bout a back rub?
Nuke!  You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball.  Ask Crash.
He did?
We lost.
Neither will I.
I don't dance.
She's dancing with me.
I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of Thomas Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated crap.  I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter, I believe in the "sweet spot", voting every election, soft core pornography, chocolate chip cookies, opening your presents on Christmas morning rather than Christmas eve, and I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last for 7 days.
See my hips?
Don't tell anybody.
Well, Annie, your place or mine?
A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--
You're gorgeous, God damn it! From the moment I first saw you I knew I had to have you.  I had to have you!
And now you wanta teach me?
Why not?
I'm quitting too.  Boys, not baseball.
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
Annie---
Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  Who's he?
Ninety-three miles an hour.
Let's have a quick word of prayer, right here, to thank the Lord for all this--
Thanks for the note--you're right, I wasn't bending my back.
Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?
Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?
I got him on the knee!
Did you call me a cocksucker?
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Drive off your back leg.  You pitch with your legs as much as your arms-
Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
You could be one of those guys-- but you don't give a fuck, Meat.
This is from Tony for the rainout. C'mon, man, let's go to the party.
"Naw"?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
You're through with one night stands?!  What do you want?
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
I was great, eh?
You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
"...Good Lord willing, things'll work out."
I'm going to the Show.
I'm trying to thank you.
Nuke...tell me something.  Did you hit me with your right or your left?
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?
Step outside, pal.
No.
No.  The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
Ohyeah.  I shoulda throwed a slider.  Damn, Crash, how're ya?
He's got a million dollar arm and a five cent head.
Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once.  Sold Lady Kenmores--it's nasty, nasty work.
Eight and twenty-four.
Nuke's overthrowing tonight, he don't look loose.  Anything bothering him?
Goddamn, that's great!  Jesus!  Listen, Crash don't like anybody to know it but--  Most nights he goes down to, you know, down to Niggertown.  To Sandy's...  the whorehouse.
Thank you.
So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.
Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer - answer that at this time.
A powerful man.
First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. We're already on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States later this year.
Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that?
I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad?
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
Hello? Hello! Ginger.
...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details.
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
Okay, Sammy.
Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?
No, of course not.
Ohh!
He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely...
Hello.
Hey, Ace.
Fuck the FBI! That prick's been dodging me for three weeks. And what is it with you?  All of a sudden, you're tryin' to tell me what to do all the time.
I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.
What happened to me? What happened to you?
All right.
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
Peekaboo, you fucks, you.
...on the line and this guy's out havin' the time of his life. He has every cop in the state watchin' him, and he's out playin' golf.
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?
You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!
Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you -
I just told you. She called me.
How'd you know I was here?
Hey, house is doin' well.  Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant.
Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
Okay, thanks.  Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry.
You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
Hello.
Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.
We need this guy.
Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants.
Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on.
I-I'll do it.
Okay, thank you for asking.
I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.
It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?
You sure?
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
Okay.
Oh, fabulous.
Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?
You didn't have to beat him up!
It's okay.  Look...  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.
If not for me, at least for Amy.
You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.
Well, that's why I'm here. She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.
How serious?
With the money.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
Hi. You didn't answer your beeper.
All right... I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
I mean, it could get us both killed.
Oh...
I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up.
Oh, sh-
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
Get - Get up! Get up!
I wouldn't -
Just wait there for me!
...stunned commissioners into the hallway, where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
...Well, I've got a large family.
Okay, I'll -
All right, I will, I will.
Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!
Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here.
I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
No.
Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.
Is this yours? Your pen?
I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
Yeah.
A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did.
I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.]
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
And here. Here.
Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.
You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! You understand?  Go over there and apologize.  Go! Get the fuck out of -
Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing.
Do you see that? Dumb Jew motherfucker. Grew up together and he's actin' like he don't even know me. I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but, you know, there's ways to do things and there's ways not to.
He's comin' over.
He's not here?
Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are you doin' here?
Yeah, I'm over here with him.
I think, you know, maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin'. I don't know.
Artie! Artie!
We're - we're placing you under arrest for -
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.
Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
Hi, Jennifer.
I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens.
He gives a fuck what I do?
Okay.
And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse.
Thanks.
And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay.
I mean, listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it... I mean, it's none of my business, but I ... I think that's what you gotta do. You gotta take it somewhere -
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
What did I tell you? Supposing he goes back home and makes a fuckin' beef?  I gotta know exactly what you said. Tell me what you said to him.
Get the fuck out of here.
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!
Come on.
I'm always here for you.
...all the luck in the world.
Right.
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
Hey, how you doin'? 
Wow.
Incredible.
Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs.
And this is Stacy.
I mean, the cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck. I mean, you know, they all worked it out together.
...bosses. I mean, they're smokin' their Di Nobilis and they're eatin' a trippa [Italian-American slang for 'tripe'.] and fuckin' suffritt', you know, fried pigs guts? While, if I wanna talk private, I gotta go to a fuckin' bus stop.
Yeah, but they're complaining.
I know. I know.
And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'
And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
I fucked up, Frankie. I fucked up good this time. Should have never started with this fuckin' broad.
Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue...
Do I hear a motion seconded?
Hey! Oh!
Since when do you talk like that?
Again!
I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
I know, but that's enough.
Take it easy, though.
...everything's comin' out of my pocket. I gotta pay for all these trips back and forth, back and forth.
Do I have to remind everyone that in two days, we'll all be dead. The Cult of Good will be a memory. I don't want to hear about lawsuits or cereals. We have a secret mission...
Cactus, I can't believe you just said all that...
Ah, Cats. Now and Forever.
No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
You say that like an amnesia victim.
How heroic of you...
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
Hmm. Not bad.
Oh now, you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all?
You're kidding.
I can. That's not an admission of guilt,  It's just..I knew you had it in you...
You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes.
God, can you hear me!
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
Don't you realize there's nothing you can do, anyway!  Nine minutes and it's all over!  The Fun Palace is a tomb. No one can get out. And choke on this furball: all doors and windows are blocked, locked, and electrified!  Even the glass around the bomb is rigged.
The "skylight?" Fool!  It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
Yeah, this is better than rape.
Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...
Oh, I wish they wouldn't feed him like that.
Well, we spent enough time building the damn thing, might as well use it.
I want out of tonight's mission. I can't do it anymore, Captain. I can't let innocent people die to prove our superiority..I can't.
Yes. I am the reporter or the architect.  You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...
How can you say things with such feeling and then turn around and put on a helmet and...Who are you?  Were you sitting on my right or my left at the card table?  Tell me!  Please tell me who you are; you own me that!
"Save the City?" I don't want to save the city, I want to move!  Listen, I'm sure the computer disc is pretty fascinating and I can't thank you enough for the little weird gold thingie, but..
Yeah, she's okay.
Oh the hand--my grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender and..You know, I realize I've never officially introduced myself...I'm Lewis Lane.
Lose the smile, Mr. Good Reflexes. We were having a pretty okay time the other night--good food, good conversation--some Catwomen show up and it's "You need cab fare?; I got to go to my Hideout--Oh, I'm sorry, I mean "warehouse."
You know, now that I hear myself tell it, I'm thinking maybe both of you are messing with me. What, you get the Helmet Monday through Thursday, then Brock takes it for the weekend...
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
A hearty breakfast is the start of a great morning...
But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
You're the One. I thought I told you to stay hidden behind the couch, CAT! You've torn the unit apart.  You've driven a great leader insane...
I know.  But it's an emergency. Somebody dying.  Okay?
What are you doing on Theo's line?
Be careful.  There were people in that crosswalk.
Have you got to tell her your life story?
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
You gotta just look the other way.
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
He's seen both of us now.
Now turn around.  I'm going to cuff you.
You switched license plates?
That was definitely out of line and totally unprovoked.  I heard you were a hitter.
That's your "rep."
Just hand up on the bitch!  Fuck you, madam.  And goodbye!
First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.
Got your badge?
Don't fuck around.  Pop a cap in him.
Any minute.
And what're you whispering for?
What'd you do!  Just pick my number out of the air?
Sure.  And they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
I am not involved.  Keep clicking your little wires.  You'll get someone else.  Good luck.
Where'd they take you to?
Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?
The cops could trace this call back to you.
Who?
No don't.  You could lose me for good.  Don't go through that tunnel.
The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school.  Rachel will recognize the car.  She'll get right in.
Where's the fucking recharger cord?  Must be in her car, dammit.
It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.
What do you do for a living?
Our house always needs touching up.
I didn't mean to.  It's just the way I am.
Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
What's happening?
What bank?
Not a chance.
No.  I hear them.  They're coming upstairs.  They know!
Lenore -- you promised you'd follow instructions.  We're almost there.  Simply get out when they slide the van open and walk to me.
They won't allow that.  It's one at a time.  And you have to be first.
Rachel was terrified when I left her.  I could see it in her eyes.
So far they're keeping their part of it.
You're not Lenore Oberfeld.
The guy with the transplant.
At least one.
I got what I fucking deserved.  I had it all.  I could've kept going!
Your friends are probably still on the line.  Pick it up and say hello.
Now you're starting to sound like a victim again.
Any idea where you're going?
Think you could do a picture of me?
Developer ran out of money years back.  I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
Who'd ever think, to look at you?
Some nice fantasy you all cooked up for me.
Think about what's going to happen to your valuables when that trunk flies open at 75 miles per?
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
They saw you kill the driver.
You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison.  He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
308-9962.
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
I'm here.  Where are you?
Fucking "A" it is!  Any argument and I'm out of here.
You should've done all this before.
Negative.
If he pulls me over he gets all the proceeds plus Lenore here.
You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.
What does it take to kill you?
Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
Why are you picking on me for?
Let's have your name and address. The government will want to send you a letter of commendation.
Good thing in a man.
You fucking promised.
Don't be like that --
Fuck off back to Essex!
It's not Pat. It's Jim.
Is that his tart? Does Pat have a tart?
No, of course not, she's a lady.
Doesn't the water get to your nails?
No.
Everybody wants something.
You all right?
Perform?
He's getting up.
Why?
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
Do you miss him?
You're something else, Dil, you know that?
See, I was always best looking after someone. Must be something in the genes.
Am I becoming repetitious?
You do something for me, Dil?
You'd do anything for me?
You said anything, Dil
Why?
You're no good at this, Jimmy.
What pills?
Are you all right, Dil?
Let me go for fuck's sake, Dil -- or they'll be here
Love me.
Then say it.
What would you do for me?
You've got to go now, Dil --
Not if you go.
Sorry, love. Now, the white ones are magnesium supplement --
Lucky you.
Do you now.
Hey -- what's he like?
Tough work, that.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
So you did fuck up.
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
Perfect.
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
Who's the old geezer?
Why would you do that?
You OK about that?
What?
And what's she like between the sheets?
So it's on the street.
What do you mean you can't?
You trying to hurt my feelings?
Well, I could say the same about you.
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
What do you know about my nature?
Didn't look like that to me...
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
Why not?
You make a nice couple.
Oh, yeah.
The best.
Do you?
Depends on what you believe in.
That you guys shouldn't be here.
She can't help it.
You liked her?
See if she's all right.
I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...
Used to run the mile, you know -- four times round the cricket pitch -- what was that game called?
And you know what?
Have you no feelings, woman?
You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
That fucker's dead --
Give me the shooter, Jude --
Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my mama didn't raise no stupid children. I know who's got the money 'n I ain't disappearing till I got my share -- 'n' my share's growin' a whole lot bigger ev'ry day.
You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
What are you talking about?
All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
Adam!
You don't look so bad in this light.
Aren't you allowed to kiss back?
That wraps it up -- Tex has the money. Go back to bed -- I'll let you know when I've found him.
I think we were wrong about Tex having the money.
Heroin -- peppermint-flavored heroin.
Tex? You mean he's here, too?
Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.
I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
Only we call them agents.
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency.
Ours.
Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.
No.
Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --
Then how do I know this is your office?
What now?
Keep going.
That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.
Why you lied to me.
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened?
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the truth, but I had to find out your part in all this.
Said what?
What are you doing?
Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --
Reggie -- you haven't spoken a word in twenty minutes.
No -- not yet.
When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss.
Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
Forty-five thousand.
Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success.
You sure nuthin's missin'?
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
You loved him?
We discovered your husband's body lying next to the tracks of the Paris- Bourdeaux railroad line. He was dressed only in his pajamas. Do you know of any reason why he might have wished to leave France?
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
He was a wealthy man?
About how wealthy would you say?
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
Yes, of course -- but if you went back and wrote me a letter --
Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- !  What's that?
How's that?
Peter Joshua.
Mr. Joshua.  Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
How did you find out?
Instant divorce you mean?
I'm still having trouble with English.
Of course? I thought he was dead.
What are you doing in here?
I don't think I follow you.
Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
There was no trace of him. All right, Reggie -- suppose you tell me what this is all about.
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
Isn't there something constructive he can do -- like start an avalanche?
But why do you want a divorce?
He knows everything.
Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.  If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
Who is it from?
Yeah? What's that?
Shoot no, not after all these years.
I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS.
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
Good.
is there anything you do?
It's almost ten o'clock.
I'm not.
It was a she.
Who is she Daddy?
We're seeing all the signs in town.
Is Jody still awake?
Did you warn her?
Of what?
Is there a picture of her somewhere?
No, you couldn't.
Pay no attention to me.
I am.
Me? Why me?
You're the killed.
Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
You can't tell your parents.
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
They're not picking me up until six.
What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?
Jody. Wait.
Go to the police station!
Thanks for coming back for me.
Oh GOD IT'S HIM!
What are you doing?
What?
Wait.
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
Who?
You ok?
Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.
You got a great mom. I'm lucky to get a zucchini stick.
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
Hide your laptop here.
Hey! That was a 3k machine.
Unfair?!
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
It's a damn postal truck!
Let me put it in easy terms, Aristotle. We are carrying a damn bomb...
Since when does...
...moron.
He could've called first.
No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.
Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.
Come on, get in the truck.
...-ed.
Billings?  No, no, no, no, no.  We need to go to McGruder.
...-er.
Get him to stand up, Night Shift.
    Elvis is on ice again.
...I'm not the psycho.
...-er!
...let live.
Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.
...waiting!
Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  Everybody  dies!
That's right.  Now,  move!

 Okay.
Come on, old Pete.  Oh.
...wanna give it a try!
...ho!

 Listen!  Listen...
You're--?  What?!
You're not dangerous!  You're crazy!  I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!
...here!
Come on!
See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
...just ready to just slide him right in there.  And what about me, huh?  What about Arlo, huh?  What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...
You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
...shit.
Not completely, anyway.
Well, all the same.  If we get to Missoula, help me find a car.  I'd appreciate it.  Then...you can...
...deal with this asshole.
 ...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt...
Ow!  
Hey, just shut up.
Hey, hey, hey.
Put your hand in my pants.
Okay, here we go.
Go!
Oh, fuck!
And Brynner's right on...
What the hell?
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
Forty-nine point four.

What?

Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!
Hang on, hang on.
Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.


Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey.  We are heroes, my man.  It's time to start actin' like it.
You did help a little.
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
Us.  Owes us.
 Yeah.
...-tiatin'.
...us.
You know, it's, uh-it's very hush-hush, as we say in the spy game.
It all started with our mission in Istanbul.
Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.

 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
...without compunction.


Well, that just about figures for today.
It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
 ...to Fort McGruder in his truck. 
No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.
We do have to take into consideration that, through your courage...

Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
They were all wearing hardware.
What the hell is all this about a detonation today?  We're scheduled...
Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?
...me, if I thought there was any real danger, I-I wouldn't go forward.
...-ple.
Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in?  Well...
...years of thinking the matter over, I began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem.
And let me guess.  You failed.
Yeah, I had a small problem with members of our side murdering civil-...
...maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper...
And I'm warning you, Leo.  Don't test me. Get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die.
This is it.
Well.  It appears someone's been lying to us.
Dutiful citizens, you have something which I have waited years for.
Carl!  Set up the camera.
Hit him.
Sir, all potential customers have been informed of the delay.  Fur-...
I wanna patch in from...
Having witnessed the effects myself, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts.
Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
Mind if you tell me what's goin' on?
Right.  Tim Mason.
Yeah, he's wanted in connection with a death this morning at the Jerome...
Hemmings!  Sam, I thought I told you to close up shop and be ready to move up the island by night-...
....-lene.
Doc...
And I can't guarantee the end will be quick.
Yeah, I'm listenin'.
...-tainer!

...it.
...-time,  remember?
Uh, we both like to fish.
Forty-nine?
...tight!

That little geek is my...
Deputy Art Lewis, Jerome County Sheriff's Department.
...back...
...without caution...

Well,  Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.
...beer.
...any idea what's goin' on here?!
...side!
 Wait.  Listen to me, Pappas.  If you don't let us by...
  All right.
 
It's too late, Mason. I've...
...gotta seal it.
 There's ammo fire from Brynner's vehicle.
Now!  Seal that tunnel now!
Barney, who is this bimbo? He a regular customer?
I don't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact – it surprised me it was so quick. I make an honest living.
How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
If you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it's admirable. And it's good advertising.
Lou Escobar – he's a Lieutenant.
Oh yes.
Why is that funny?
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
What does this mean?
How do you do that?
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
...No...
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
I'll just tell my wife.
I'll throw that in too.
Then what'll you do?
That's just lovely.
I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.
You've done well by yourself.
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
You wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
Or her name?
No, he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people. But they weren't very important, just a bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a dam. Now beat it, Gittes, you don't come out of this smelling like a rose, you know.
Yeah, I took 'em. So what?
This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
Where?
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
Not that Mulwray?
I should talk this over with your husband.
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
I got your check in the mall.
I don't like the word 'cheat.'
Mr. Gittes.
Is there anything else you want to know?
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
How did it happen?
Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
Over the water department, or over you?
Oh, yeah?
Never forgave him for what?
That dam is a con job.
We got it. We got it, baby.
I'll stay.
What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
What's wrong?
What about it?
I saw him.
It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
I can't...
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
You know any good criminal lawyers?
I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
I'll take care of it.
...where does Kyo live?
Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute.
Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
Just to be certain, I wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
After all, you work with a man for a certain length of time, you come to know him, his habits, his values, and so forth. Well either he's the kind who chases after women or he isn't.
He never even kids about it.
You're a married man, am I right?
Do you know me?
Have we ever met?
When it comes.
Jake, what're you doin' here?
The L.A. River?
Ida Sessions wants to see you.
Then go home and forget about it.
I'm sure he loves you, too. You know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? You're better off not knowing.
They were partners.
Apple core?
That right?... She used to be some looker.
She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she was knocked up and didn't even know who the father was. Went there to get rid of it.
You must not come here! How many times do I have to tell you?  If the film catches fire, runt that you are, you'd go up in a burst of flame...whoosh! And turn into a piece of...
Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames!
Because I'm an idiot. How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could do it. Besides I wasn't lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When I grew up, another war! Now it's all different. Times have changed. And you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me!
It's got to be sent to another town. And if we don't the owner of that movie house gets pissed off.
Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso? 
Eh! Love...what a mystery!  I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them.  Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants... 
Good morning, father. It's hard on the feet, huh?
I've been looking for you all day. Did you buy the milk?
Then where's the money?
Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -
That's all right.  We have no secrets from our readers.  Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein.  He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable?
"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur -  - last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of - of -"  I can't pronounce that name, Mr. Kane.
"Her singing, happily, is no concern of this department.  Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to..." 
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
I've just made a shocking discovery. The "Enquirer" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!
Let's hope they like it there.
Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"!  This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists -  Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the "Enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.
Go in and ask him to hurry.
Yes, very!  Naturally.
Who's a busy man?  Me?  I'm Chairman of the Board.  I got nothing but time ...  What do you want to know?
From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end.  Anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!
Wasted?
Sixty-two thousand -
Do we stand for the same things that the "Chronicle" stands for, Mr. Bernstein?
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
Hello, Mr. Leland.
My little sanctum is at your disposal. But I don't think I understand -
I'm not criticizing, Mr. Carter, but here's what I mean.  There's a front page story in the "Chronicle,"  and a picture - of a woman in Brooklyn who is missing.  Probably murdered.  A Mrs. Harry Silverstone.  Why didn't the "Enquirer" have that this morning?
The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
Was the show covered by every department?
But there's another one still to come - the dramatic notice.
Yes, Mr. Kane.
How do you do?  I came here - and I made Mr. Kane come with me...  because I recieved this note -
What story, Mr. Rogers?
You don't have to show me anything, Mr. Rogers.  I believe you.
Hello, Brad -
I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - I didn't -
I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -
Oh!!
I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story.  You can't tell me that the voters of this state -
Oh yes, there is.
I can't tell you the things he said, Charlie.  You haven't got any idea -
You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -
You've got some on your face.
Oh!
Where's the soap?
Where's the towel?
Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six -  I run a couple of newspapers.  How about you?
I didn't think you did.  If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
Charlie!  I said, what time is it?
I mean in New York.
Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be.  I was once.  Sometimes you get me to believing I never was.
Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
You'll never have another chance to hit me again.  I never knew till this minute -
I'm going to leave you.
I understand that you have political ambitions.  Unfortunately, you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own -
But, it is impossible.  I will be the laughingstock of the musical world!  People will say -
Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -
You goin', Mom?
"Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast."  You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast.
As Charles Foster Kane, who has 			eighty- two thousand, six hundred and thirty-one shares of Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I do have a rough idea of my holdings - I sympathize with you.  Charles Foster Kane is a dangerous scoundrel, his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him.  You may, if you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars.
It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane.
That's the second sentence you've started with "I" -
Charles, I tell you there is no war! There's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -
I mean I've got a job for you.
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
Why not?
Charlie!  Now you're not making sense.
I'm drunk.
First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "Enquirer."
Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't agree anymore.  I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.
All right.
You talk about the people of the United States as though they belonged to you.  When you find out they don't think they are, you'll lose interest.  You talk about giving them their rights as though you could make a present of liberty. Remember the working man?  You used to defend him quite a good deal. Well, he's turning into something called organized labor and you don't like that at all.  And listen, when your precious underprivileged really get together - that's going to add up to something bigger than - than your privilege and then I don't know what you'll do - sail away to a desert island, probably, and lord it over the monkeys.
That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?
You still want to be transferred to the other paper?
Hello, Brad.
I know, but -
Thompson!
I'll get to it right away, Mr. Rawlston.
Right away.  Will you have something, Mr. Thompson?
She's plastered, isn't she?
Are you sure?
How long have you been smoking?
What's this?
Jesus!
Yeah, but not in here.
Like I'm responsible for all the smokers!
You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
Dick.
Hey Caitlin...  Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you. Nothing personal.
It's not what you think.
The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.
I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway...
You don't have anything to do with it.
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?
Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
He's not invited.
You're such an asshole.
How'd you get here so fast?
I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom.
What about Caitlin?
Well, he missed!
Excuse me, do you have...
Awww, he's so cute. What's his name?
I work in a shitty video store. I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie.
Pack of cigarettes.
You open?
You only brought one ball?!
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
Want something to drink? I'm buying.
You don't want to know.
Seven months.
She called me Brad.
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
Great story, isn't it?
Allan Harris.
...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
Empire.
Yeah.
More or less.
Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.
A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.
Nudie booth?
Which ones?
No.
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
Why'd you apologize?
I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
What happened to all the Gatorade?
Number six.
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
Stop it. This is beneath even you.
I'm not taking you to this funeral.
Oh, my god.
His dick was in his mouth?
You know.
I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in.
Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time?
You know what? I don't think I care for your rationale.
Jesus!
You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
You're happy to get a fine?
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you?
Like ten after.
I'm calling out. Going to hit the hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then try to see Veronica.
I still remember Caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel-the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room.
Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
I am not.
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! Hey!
Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.
Pay the good man.  Don't you close soon?
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
You used to go out with her?
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...?
All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?
I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
What were you doing?
How much money did you leave up there?
You're trusting.
"Be there?"
Three?
They put up the least amount of struggle.
What do you mean?
He requested this?
I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
A few?
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again- and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for!  I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't.
I'm not out of shape!
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear!
Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum.
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
He only speaks Russian?
No way!
Is he staying here?
Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?
Feel that.
To a five-year-old kid? What a scumbag!
Sure. How about the beach?
You hope what feels good?
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh.
I... I don't know what to say.
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.
I have first dibs.
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
Jessie, Jessie, copy?
Jessie!  Are you alright?
Throw it up or I'll kill her.
Glad you could drop in.
We'll never know, will we?
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
Forget me.  If you can, get away.
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
Two...
Please -- oh, no -- please!
Oh, my God!  I can't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar. 
He knows it well.
You can stop right there.
Enough.
The winds are picking up.
You're saying, I don't understand?  I'm the <u>only</u> one who does understand.  I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all.  Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you.  But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I <u>understand you</u>.
If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
Can't do it?  I don't believe this.  Don't you feel anything?
Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.
That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.  Why'd you have to come up here?!
Man, it costs a fortune to heat this place.
You still wear the cable necklace I gave you.
If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
Nice view, huh?
Can you see light?
Pull it apart!
Reach up!  Do it!
Thanks for holding on.
There's no "we".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
What do you think?  Maybe I could reach the ledge without falling. No, forget it.
Take the rope.
Look here, the mountain man. You're Walker, right?
What's he doing?
Talk.  No tricks, no codes, no messages.  You haven't found us. It was a fake call.
Mr. Travers is not the athletic type, he needs something more direct.
It's up there, on the Tower.
For Christ's sake, they're kids.
Travers, you're not running things.
Tucker, you know where the money is-- I want it.
On top of the peak.
Travers!  Hurry it up.
What's the delay?
Don't give him anything.
This way.
No names, this is an open line!
Rich...
What did you do that for?
I don't like you should do what you done. And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.
He are here! He have arrived! Hooray!
I know who you are! Isn't it your picture in the newspapers? Didn't I see you this morning on the video? Are you not the poor victim of this horrible new technique?
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
Great, sir. Great.
They're very, very important people and they're interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,
Naughty, naughty, naughty, you filthy old soomaka.
Thank you very much, sir.
It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son.
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
A big black mark I tell you for every one we don't reclaim. A confession of failure for every one of you who ends up in the stripy hole.
You are now a murderer, little Alex. A murderer, yes.
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
Do you feel that way now?
Do you still feel suicidal?
She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old in-out, real savage. But quick as a shot came the sickness, like a detective that had been watching around the corner and now followed to make his arrest. Alex retching. Minister rises.
Good.
No thanks, Mum. It'll pass in a minute...  ... What have you done with all my own personal things?
Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell.
Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
What do I want?
Religion?
Do you mean Church of England?
Blue eyes?
Have you ever had any mental illness?
I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.
You've heard Beethoven before?
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
Yes?
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
Good. You can do whatever you like with these.
I was quite enjoying that.
You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.
One thing I could never stand is to see a filthy, dirty old drunkie, howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers and going blerp, blerp in between as it might be a filthy old orchestra in his stinking rotten guts. I could never stand to see anyone like that, whatever his age might be, but more especially when he was real old like this one was. The boys stop and applaud him.
Stop him! Stop him! A leg is stuck out and Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over him.
If thou lose hope being weary in the days of distress, thy strength shall be diminished.
Father, I have tried, have I not?
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
One jacket - blue pinstripe.
One shirt - blue, collar attached.
One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.
Mothballs, sir.
Carry on, Chief.
Pitiful rookerful...
Yeah... Pete the English.
Enough is remembered though, little Alex. Dim and Georgie laugh. They drag Alex to a low water through.
Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.
I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
You like Bach?
Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.
It's no big deal.
Sure.  I'm starting an 800 hotline.  Caught part of your phone call.  And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe, Armani, elegant, not too hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of, looks like Bottega...
Soon.  But I take little ones all the time.  Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.
Max, the cab driver!
...okay, Max, I believe you...I'll get out of the building...
Get outta here!  You and Louis?
Remember what you played?
...goddamn it, you telling me this motherfucker's whacked three of our witnesses tonight...
Advance team, two men, stick to that goddamn cab, stay in radio contact, the rest of us follow in the van. Nobody moves until the entire team's in place...
There was a car here, you can see where the glass came down all around it.  Ivan flew out the window and went bam.
Happy to meet you, Mrs. Rilke.
Quite an achievement...
I brought you flowers.
I'm standing right here.
Uh, yeah?  Lenny?  It's me.
...I'm sorry, I don't see it that way...
First time in New York?
Why not?
Oh?  How long you been doing this?
Bullshit.  You probably know the light schedules, too.  Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing.  Five stops, one night.  I gotta catch a six a.m. flight.  I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures.  Why don't you hang with me?
Uh, look...why don't you just take the car...
Max.  May we leave the scene of the crime now, please.
You listening to me?
What are you doing?
You said you were visiting friends!
Music.
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
What do you care?  Ever hear of Rwanda?
Oh, it's okay, then.  'Cause you're just taking out the garbage...
I can't believe this.
That one's probably married.  Think of his kids.  His wife's pregnant...
Who's that?
So what?
Lenny?  You're an asshole.
Max?  What are you doing?
Pull your head out of your ass.  Get your thinking straight.  You wanna die?
Max.  You threw my briefcase in the river.  You've got balls bigger than Toledo.
Damn, Max.  I'm impressed.  Really.  I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there.
Would you have called her?
It's what I do for a living.
How do I know?  But, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me.  Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted...  I dunno.
Get with it.  Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us.  Lost in space.  The universe doesn't care.  The cop, you, me?  Who notices?
As in...? 
'Cause I never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves...
Well.  That was brilliant.
The F.B.I., the C.I.A.  You name the initials and they're down there.
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
Are you crazy?!
Look, I'm sorry --
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
Saved you last night's, too.
Flip.  You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here.  Tell me something.  You think I'm crazy?
I don't see the connection.
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
You think I'm crazy.
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
I better get going.
Just relax.
You switched the charts; you tell me.
I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch.  And thanks.
What took so long?  You were in there all day.
You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
That's it?
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
What are you doing?
So what's the question?
He's why you punish yourself.
Did you see the van back there?
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day.  To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way.  Everything you do is magic.
Yeah...  Would you, I mean, could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?
You look great.
We're going to Queens?
How do you really know there's gold in Fort Knox?  Just because they say so?  We should go to Tennessee and demand to see it.
Did you kill my father?!
Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
I'm sorry.
Blue moon...
Liza?
Get in.  I'll pull you up to the fourth floor.
Geronimo is down.
They changed Franklin's portrait.
Do I know you?
Thank you.
Then screw you.  I'll rot.
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
What I'm about to tell you is partially documented.  The Freedom of Information Act saw to that. But much more of it isn't.  For reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, I'm going to share -- secrets -- with you. Repeat any of it and you'll simply bestow the title of 'paranoid' upon yourself.
We experimented with hallucinogens.  We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state.  We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
Belief is immaterial.  What's important is the truth... It's been my job to find Jerry.  I'm very much responsible for him.
In Jerry's safety deposit box.
So, you doing anything tonight?
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
Ah, your psychotic is here.
We're waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared up.  This guy Fletcher's something else.
While we walk.  D.C. police want him for assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we're tracking him on a string of bank robberies.  No one knows what the C.I.A. wants him for.
Guy's a C.I.A. shrink.  Here to I.D. Fletcher.  They knew each other somehow.
That you come with me.
We've lost contact.
There's no plug to pull.
... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  As your father?
Pepsi?  Tequila?
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
... Arrangements also have to be made for the V.I.P.s coming in, mostly religious leaders...
Do you have a minute -- ?
What?
... Two years is still a hell of a long time -- and as far as we can tell there aren't any provisions in the machine design for storing food, water, even air...
Right.  Well.
Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair...
Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
... And while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind.
Mr. Rank's organization represents the point of view of tens of millions of families, Dr. Arroway. Feel free to disagree, but there won't be any suppressing of opinions here today.
J39 Z186...?
Here, right around Centaurus A.
Okay, let's just slow down.  Pull up the starfield signal origin.
I'll come right to the point, Doctor.  Your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of National Security.
I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive...
-- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode!
Colonel Jarrod, I'd like a twenty mile radio-silent perimeter put around this installation immediately.
Pardon me, but you can't do -- !
Talk to him.
Time to sleep now, Captain.  But you can ask more questions in the morning, okay?
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
... life is unspeakably rare.  So whenever we do find another civilization, especially one that's... struggling... We send a message.  Sometimes we can offer help.  Sometimes we can't.  But we always try.  Life is simply too precious not to.
Eventually you'll get here on your own.  This was just the first step; in time you'll take another.
No more stalling, Captain.
I didn't realize I was out.
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
Not if you think like a Vegan.
Some kind of circuitry...?
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
Ellie.  Arroway.
I read your paper on ETI's.  It's brilliant.
... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about!  Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts...
Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
And you think I don't want those things?  You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday?  Let's get married.
I'm serious about this, Peter --
Ellie.
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
'My father's house has many mansions.'
That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
... It's an old story.  I grew up in South Boston, more or less on the streets.  By the time I was thirteen I'd tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen I'd stopped using but I was dealing full-time.  By the time I was nineteen I decided I didn't want to live any more, at least not in a world like that.  One day I got on a bus; I got as far as Ohio before my money ran out, and after that I just kept walking.  Didn't eat, didn't sleep... just walked.  I ended up collapsing in a wheat field.  There was a storm... I woke up...  And that's about as far as words'll go.
I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
So.  Is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this?
If you came back.  If you survived at all.  Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't.
I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt.  And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.
Ellie, what is it?
And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
But I made this arrangement --
You don't take another man's place, boy.
I'm lucky I got a broom. Work up top. Real easy job. Man, it's gonna be hot down in that ditch.
No. But things ain't always like they seem, Arletta. You know that. A man's gotta go his own way.
You think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin' and hollerin' and high hopes, but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side. Luke?
Lookit her bounce.
Tell us about it.
What's all this dirt in the yard?
Supposin' you was to backslide on us, Luke? Supposin' you was to backsass or try to run again...
You cut that up fer lunch, Luke.
Here, Captain.
Cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, Captain.
I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.
Uh-huh. And he ain't got nothing showing. Raise his head off.
Dragline, lemme look at the picture.
Oh we got our sources... Tearing the heads off... what was it... gumball machines? What kind of thing is that for a grown man?
Plumb busted out. Looks like the hard road finally got to Mister Lucas War Hero.
Whatta you mean, forget it?
They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow.
'Atsa sign I got me an affectionate nature.
Oh Lord!
A bunch. Must be halfa dozen Newmeat.
Man! It's gonna be one hot muther today.
Man, it's so hot.
I'm in.
Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.
Koko, why don't you let one of these Newmeats take your broom for today?
You think you've been working hard. This muther'll break your back.
I don't see no sign of guts in you.
You ain't man enough to wear them!
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
We'll get the paramedics...
She just got to sleep.  Do you have to tell her about it now?
The first two murders.
You don't listen very good.  This break in -- I can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole.  Or I could see it gets forgotten.
Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again...
Hello, Daryll Lee.
I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.
Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
Would you want to work with us on this?
Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here.  I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts.  I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good.
Is it an ongoing case?
Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
I am not going to look at any more pictures.  They're like a disease. They get into my head.  I can't get them out.
It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.
That's amazing.  A whole new book, thought up in a minute.  Very good.  All I know how t do is get up, take a shower, and go to work. Hope, if he does another I'll nail the son of bitch, and they'll spell my name right in the newspaper. Where is Andy going?
Ruben.
Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44.  It's Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?
They put  Merry <u>Saks</u> on it?!
They weren't going to show it to me?!  The arrogance!  It's my <u>life</u>!
How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
Helen -- let go.  You've got to let go.
You were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank? Oh God, I <u>am</u>!  Make them some coffee.  Halloran, is it?  Investigator Goetz?  I had a crank call myself-- he said...  I thought it might be Daryll Lee Cullum.  I thought he might be out of prison.
Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.
It's a woman shot in a car?
Don't hang up!
They all have one...
He was in my apartment!
Ma'am, please get out of your vehicle...
Just get out of your vehicle...
I was just about to advise the Inspector here not to show Dr. Hudson the note.
Don't put yourself down like that. I <u>never</u> used you.  I worked my way up like a marine grunt!
If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  Where did he pick her up?
Absolutely.
Ruben, my God, I ought to put you on report.
Get the pictures, and casts of footprints.
What's Abba?
The woman was in shock.  She was totally out on ranks.  I stayed because I didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack.  Stop that, you son of a bitch!  The place wasn't secure.  I was doing my goddamn job!  And, for the <u>second time</u>, I slept in her living room.
I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll be in the jail when you wind this up...
I tagged the goddamned stocking. It ain't lost.  We're sequestering that evidence.  That's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into...
How about I put Nikko on it?
Sergeant?
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
Where you going?
What the hell you need her for?
That was Bundy.  He killed forty of them, identical, long hair, parted in the middle, alike as Barbie dolls.  ...this is hopeless.  Let's try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and TV hookups and broadcast a warning?
She's in no shape to give her statement tonight...
He's not treating her right...
We were together six years, sir!
Put in the Kevin Costner.
There, that's better.
Renata tells me you're going to rent a car.
You'd better drive him. He's a bit shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where is yours?
I thought that was you, up there.
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.
What does he want from you?
Crash victim?
I've always wanted to drive a crashed car.
He must have driven through a pool of blood. If the police stop you again, they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed. Vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood.
Patient.
I want to see my mother immediately.
The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
The question, Letty, is how are you feeling?
I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
But what I really can't believe is that I'm starting to actually miss work.
What?
Oh, wait a minute, now I see where you're going.
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
Are you sure, Dear?
I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul.
Ruth's already taken him home.
We aren't allowed to wear jewelry in here, Mom.
Honestly, Letty.
I'm really not that hungry.
Letty, you should be in bed.
Yeah?
You can only do what feels best to you now.
Yes?   Go right ahead.
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
But you're checking it out.
For a price.
We're supposed to be asleep.
A daisy for the lady.
You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
What else would you do?
I have a terrible confession.
It's a good thing my family loves you.
I do.
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
Well?
Where to?
This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.
Wow.
You've got to see the kitchen first.
Did I get spaghetti sauce on my face?
Not yet.
Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?
Silly, silly, silly.
What are you doing?    You're going to be late.
Sure. Why?
It's prettier here than I thought it would be.
Are you all right?
Exactly. It's time to make decisions.
Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.
Who?
Have you been seeing another teacher?
What?
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. You'll love my Grandma Rosa.
No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
This is turning to shit. If word gets out of my involvement in this I'll go to prison.
Jesus.   What kind of FBI agent are you?
Hello?
Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.
Oui.
This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.
Hello?
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
Can I offer you something.    A drink? Coffee?
And?
They're gonna be what?
Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?
And the other half?
What kind of business?
Get that, will you?
Why is everything an argument with you?
Hopefully no one.
Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house.
This is Zero.
How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?
They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
All right, knock it off.
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
Anybody hungry?
I will.
He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
Can you believe that guy?    What a moron.
What hotel?
Yes.
I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.
Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I?  I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!
I am not comfortable with this.   I'm not a good liar.
I'll drive.
No.   How much?
Today's your lucky day, Sami.
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
You guys used to work together?
It's good.
This is great. After everything we've been through we've got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball.
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
Algeria.
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that?
And how do we do that?
You ever hear of jet lag?
Did she break your heart?
Can't sleep?
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
Sounds boring.
Why?
Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!
Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?
She's crazy.  You should have killed her.
Who are you?
I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!
Why do you want to teach me?
My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?
You're already a thief.
You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain.  You know... you've gone as far as you can go.  I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
I'm tired now.
Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...
Please.
About you and Li Mu Bai?
No, really?
Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters.
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
Lo?
Well, there used to be!  What's your name?  I'm Lo.  The Hans call me Dark Cloud.  I'm not that tall or big, but I'm quick as lightning.
Go.
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
You were enlightened?
What was it?
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
I don't understand.  How can you part with it?  It has always been with you.
Jade Fox?  Impossible.
No.
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.
She needs direction... and training.
For her, they might make an exception.  If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption... I tried sincerely to give it up but I have brought us only trouble.
I'll look around and catch up later.
Mu Bai, hold on.  Give me some hope...
Save your strength.
We know who stole the missing item. If the thief returns it, I'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further.
Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
It's Jade Fox!
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?
This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
Just don't tell me you "owe me one."  What file?
Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the street here."  He will "erase my ass."
You, my friend, are dead.  I saw your body.  You got buried.
You okay, man?  I mean, what just happened.
You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.
Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.
You're not a cop, either.  What do you want him for?
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story.
Top Dollar.
You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
I believe our friend Elly call you Mister Crow.  Please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up.
Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!
No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- !
What the hell are you?
Get it?
Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
...necklace... pearls...
Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.
Who got himself what?
Do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  Whole lives erased.  A way of life, polluted.  Today, no one forces me to move.  I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
I have his journal.
Why not?
You a lesbo?
You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
How's the water?
You're naked.
That's repulsive.
How are you today?
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
That's none of your business.
I'm... I'm alright.
Sure. Have a good night.
I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive.
I do.
That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person.
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
Would you like a tour?
Why aren't you understanding?
But you knew this was important to me.
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
What do you mean?
Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
What are the boys like?
That's great.
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
See that wasn't so bad.
That's so romantic. Have you responded?
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
He made you give him a blow job.
My father just took me on a trip to Australia.
But I thought high school is only four years.
Excellent.
Jesus. We've been at this for six months.
But you said you have the worst reputation.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
My daughter, Rachel.
Whoa!
Yes!
Where is she?!
Pleased to meet you.
Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
Sorry.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.
Why not?
I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
Who are you calling?
Before we go through with this, I just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause.
Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that.
That her?
Nothing.
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
Get off me!
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
Let me get that for you.
She's not here.
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
I said, do you want some water?
Did she show up?
Ronald, e-mail's for geeks and pedophiles. Be romantic. Write her another letter.
Hey Ronald.
Does she go up to the Farren's often?
I love the smell of pine.
Did your wishes ever come true?
But where did you get it, Amy?
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
I'd hate her to grow up like that.
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
Oilie, that's for the children to play with.
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
What is it, Alice?
That's the Farren house.
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories — I'm sick of this sort of thing.
Irena. But who are you?
But where is that?
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
Oh yes they do.  Look.  One is like a tall princess.
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
All right, Amy.  Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
It's you...Irena...my friend!
A lady threw it to me.
A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
Been crying? That won't please your Daddy. You'd bettor cheer yourself up.
I wasn't singing to myself.
You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
There was a deer on the other side of the fence.
Bad luck to see death in the snow.
I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.
I like stories.
Hurry, hurry.
Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.
Good night, mother, good night.
It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting.
When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
I didn't even have to coax her tonight.
I'm lucky Jen's not like that.
A dog at Victoria's Secret?
Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
Jennifer?
You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
He's a very talented musician.
I wonder what it's like being you. Being noticed all the time.
My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
Or if there's a full moon.
It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing.
You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore.
And he was ripped limb from limb?
So did you do it?
No, did you fuck him?
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
And then?
Are those Mark's?
I wonder if he's married.
I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.
I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent?
Charming Carlton.
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's.
And what makes you think you killed a man?
Hello?
Get rid of him!
How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...
"Paranoia, insecurity, depression, changes in vision, feelings of losing control; belief that you have a mental problem..." Nothing about turning into a werewolf.
"The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.
I tried to kill myself -- earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I'm depressed I clean.
About Benito.
You're kidding, really?
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
What?
You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
It's a matter of life and death.
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
Mark.
The Nielson's?
Coffee and...
I think we should do something with strong female characters...
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
No, she died when I was twelve.
How about you? Briefs or boxers?
I really gotta get going.
Oh my god, you scared the shit out of me. You following me again?
No, no... But Mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills men you date.
I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.
That's it? Hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it. She made us call her a different name. She'd say, "You're talking to Betty now" and we'd leave the house for a few days.
How do you know?
Be careful!
I knew you wouldn't kill me.
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
A kiss? Did you have sex with him?
Seems you were the last to see Carlton alive. And the last to see Gregory alive.
No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.
She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
I was thinking about becoming a cop myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up?
Nah, I don't wanna break up with Wanda, I just wanna see Carmen too.
Madonna's in Penthouse?
She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.
It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
You think mafia hit?
Did we get those DNA tests back?
What's he doing here?
All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him.  She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute.
His wife.
They don't speak English...
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
What about Thompson, sir?  Wasnít this his case?
You typed this report?
I need everything on the Jonathan White case.
I don't know who they are.
Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't remember...  Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off this case.  Now.
But...  How long has this been happening?
Your name is John White.
Why?
I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
I can't do that.  It's dangerous. What about my parents?  Do you know where I can find them?
Uh --Mr. Alexander?
The Washington Post.
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
What do you think you're doing?!
They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
Nightmare...
Look, everything can be handled.  We'll just find a way to handle it.
A condition...
We think so.
You mean we get `Dave' to nominate you as Vice President.
Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
Clean.
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
Oh my God...
Now,  let's say the whole country. Was in that car.   The entire United States of America.
Now some of this may feel a bit Strange at first.  You gotta remember that even a professional Politician has Some trouble getting used to...
At a press conference.
Thanks, I wrote it.
I thought you said I wasn't going to see her.
Let's call it a night.   I can't take any more.
Now he's making stuff up about me.
Yes, Mr. President?
Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
Something like what...
... Sometimes they do.
You ever think back to how you started.
Really?
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
You mean with you and everything?
But Bill was your king, not Bob.
Didn't mean to bum you out.
... How could I what?
Oh... Yeah.
Kind of reminds me of that thing you did back in the state legislature.
Just souvenirs.  Towels and stuff.
You know, secretaries and stiff.
Yeah.  Is that funny?
You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't it?  I can't keep all of this a secret.
You really believe that?
I saw you on T.V... at his funeral.
I never thought I'd...
So this is it?
The Monroe?
After hanging up there a few days you will be mad for food...crazed! You will lust for it! YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM!
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
Then why did you come here?
His madness....could be from shock.
What is it?
Listen, Missy. I am the only due process that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one of the people doin' the servin' from now on is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough! All that's
Tonight?
The great state of Florida. People came here fer years ta die. Retire and expire. The rest o' the country used ta think we was nothin' but a bunch o' farts and fogies. Hah! Now this here's the new Capital o' the World! Hah! They came here...died...went to hell...and the Devil sent 'em back as an army. Hah! General Gasparilla's army...MY ARMY!
There's no place like this place. Warm climate. This facility. Christ, there ain't nothin' like this no-damn-where! Even the Feds knew that. That's why they stored so much o' their shit down here. It's all mine now. All mine. Just let 'em try ta come after us down here, which they will some day...take a likin' ta what all we got an' come after us. They'll hafta get past my army! An army that ain't afraid ta die...ha ha ha...'cause it's awreddy DAID! HA HA HA HA....
That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course.
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
I can find it myself. I didn't come that far.
They seem to be havin' a good time. Some punishment.
Toby's right. They're not gonna sit around with their fingers up their asses while we bust up their toys.
Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?
That's the general alarm. Jesus! They musta got in!
I didn't realise! Those were de-caps! I didn't know that....de-caps... revived!
One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
NOOOOOOOOO!
You're....you're disgusting! You're....FILTH!
Toby...thank God...wait here. I gotta find out what's goin' on.
It's because of me.
Charlie Dalton.
I feel like I've never been alive.  For years I've been risking nothing.  I have no idea what I am or what I want to do! Neil, you know you want to act.  Knox wants Chris.
Well hell no, Charlie, but that's not the point.  That's not the point at all!
He flatters me so I'll help him with Latin.
Well...
Well, of course not.  It's just that... You could have warned us.
Don't you think they'll figure out who did it?!  Don't you know they'll come to you and demand to know what the Dead Poets Society is?   Charlie, you had no right to do something like that!
But what if they see it, Nuwanda?
Yes sir.
Don't stop.
Who else was involved in this?
What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.
Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.  I'm just saying
Who's in?
Oh Chet, that feels fabulous,
Don't stop.
Pleased to meet you.
But I love you.
Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-
What is that?
I have to go home. Chet might call.
We thought it would be good to break old habits, sir.
And don't limit poetry to the word. Poetry can be found in a work of art, music, a photograph, in the way a meal is prepared--anything with the stuff of revelation in it.  It can exist in the most everyday things but it must never, never be ordinary  By all means, write about the sky or a girl's smile but when you do, let your poetry conjure up salvation day, doomsday, any day, I don't care, as long as it enlightens us, thrills us and--if it's inspired--makes us feel a bit immortal.
Oh Captain, My Captain.  What if we don't know anything about someone like Rahesh Non?
This was my first classroom, John, did you know that?  My first desk.
Boys marching.  Clapping in unison.
Todd, there's a picture of Whitman over the door.  What does he remind you Of? Quickly, Anderson, don't think about it.
Now there's the poet speaking!  Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see.  NOW!
Really?  You told your father what you told me?  You let him see your passion for acting?
They're friends of my dad.  Probably in their nineties or something.
Where are you going?
His grades are hurting, Charlie.
If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost.  That is where they should be.  Now put foundations under them.
I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
I say we go tonight.  Everybody in?
Beyond the stream.  I think I know.
What is this, a midnight study group?
My parents wanted me here all along but my grades weren't good enough.  I had to go to Balincrest to pull them up.
So what do you think of my father?
But why?  Don't you understand what Keating is saying?  Don't you want to do something about it?
I've found it.
Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.
But if he said no before then...
By the way, there's a meeting this afternoon.  You coming?
No, I want you in.  But being in means you gotta do something.  Not just say you're in.
This is your desk set.  I don't get it.
I mean, this is one special gift!  Who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one!
Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
You the Captain?
How do we get out of here?
They are...they are everywhere.
Who?
We don't even know if his boat is still there...you saw Billy!
You remember the first time we met Finnegan? I think you were just starting out...smuggling gold off Sumatra for those two Chinese...what did we use to call them?
And no questions asked.
Speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
Not an option.
Where are my men?
But what makes you think there aren't more of those...things...back there?
You don't have to be so touchy.
What is it?
So how do you get from the Bronx to the South China sea?
I don't mean to drop in unannounced ...you ready...
Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...
You don't take orders very well, do you?
Where's you friend?
The hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable...
Hanover!! Hanover!!
What did you do the my kids!!
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
Was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to...
Why don't you back off?
Someone's back there.
I'm not screwing around with you man...I hate the cold water.
Fucking women, man...
Nick's going?
Ammo! Get the ammo!
This is it. Definitely. This is it, but they changed it.
Where the hell were you? We were all set -- beer, broads. Right? Am I right?
What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, Albert. Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!
Tell him, Vince!
You, Vince! You! You are! You're a crock! You're a walking, talking crock!... I mean, what do you know?
In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
Albert! For Christ's sake... John! Wait a minute, you guys!
I got delayed. I --
He's real bad, Nick.
Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
No. None of that.
You mean...?
Wait! First I give you special fuck!
No?
Not so good.
Sal.
Why?... What do you mean?... Why???
Linda...
Linda, what's the matter?
I was just wondering... Nick... You're going hunting... If I could use this place to stay, because...
I don't know what we've been waiting for!
What kind of beer would you like?
Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?
Yeah... All the guys, we're all going huntin'. Like we did. You know? Like we always used to.
Who the hell is he?
Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
Won't we? Right? Am I right?
You do?
Nick, he just came back.
What'd he say?
Pow?
Hey, Nick?
Tomorrow I go with Vince.
Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!
Merle...! Jesus! Hey, how are you?
I like it, Nick.
Great. That's great.
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
How're you guys... I mean, how've you guys been?
And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?
Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.
Yeah?
Talk fast.  Polls open in half an hour.
Michael called yesterday.  He wants to take Willy for the summer.
I think he wants more than your cookies.
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest.
I want to see my wife and kid.
You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop it?
Hello Wade.
That's not your zone.  Stick to data entry.
What do you mean he's escaped?! They're not supposed to escape!
Maybe I should put on the training whe---
Does it drive itself, too?
No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?
They're going to rob that bank.
Then what goes on in there?  What I mean is, what are you thinking about?
How then?
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
What's this place?
You need anything else?
Wanna try?
Rip Van Winkle.
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
What are you doing this for, Sanchez?
You be careful.
No.  I want to be with you.
You should be in hospital.
You never want to find out.
You all right?
The people, Jabez -- the people.
Hey, you! Watch out there -- you're scuffing my Brussels carpet -- Consarn them.
Who are these people?
Belle --
I see why you're here -- you knew that nobody was coming.
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
Daniel! Don't ever let me catch you doing that again!
What's that, sir?
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
Granny, when do we move to the new house?
Lan's to goodness, what happened to that hen? Did you use that beanshooter again?
Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
What Grange?
Never mind. What's your name?
Mornin', Jabez ...
Afraid ... of what?
Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you.
Good evening, Neighbor Stone.
.... Miser Stevens' soul, Mr. Stone. Yes -- I am sorry for the disturbance.
Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.
You know darn well it is.
I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners.
Here's a man who knows what's good for Dan'l Webster! Medford rum! Ah, a breath of the Promised Land!  To the champion of the Iron Horseshoe, Jabez Stone!
Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?
Well, Jabez -- I'm a little pressed for time. You wanted to discuss something -- some business --
The only one you missed -- is the President.
You keep that -- that's for you. I want you to talk up the party to make sure that the best folks really come.
That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster.
Jabez -- help!
Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
Remember, Mary, how he said it: "Couldn't have done better myself, Jabez Stone," and it was my first speech. I don't know what came into me, Mary. I just stood up and the words came flowing like water out of my mouth.
Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners!
That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
Jabez -- once you said we'd never change --
Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. 
Mary --
"There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God and eschewed evil."
There! Guess that ought to hold good. Put him down here, by the fire, Mary.  But we don't want to get him too close -- we'll have roast pork for supper.
Well ... make him keep quiet.
Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.  Don't seem right, somehow!
Well -- that's comforting!  Supper.
Do you really think that?
I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
Oh, here you are, Jabez. Lan's, I was worried about you.... Hail in August! The crops will be ruined!
What's that you say, Son?
You go down and see what's keeping Dorothy.
My son ... what's the matter?
So you've made up your mind to go to the party.
I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
Mary -- you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a little. You see, sometimes we think we're licked in this life -- but we weren't put here to be licked. Don't you believe it. Sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight. Now I was thinking before you came, of coming over to Cross Corners end of the month, to get acquainted with my Godson -- and other things.
Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
Mr. Webster, I presume?
Me?
The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
How 'bout some Christmas music?
What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without him, they might let us go...at least we have a chance...
You're amazing.  You figured this all out already?
I know what you are feeling.  But this is not productive --
Yes...I know about them.  The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault.
The code key, please...?
Bad for your health anyway.
Better than being caught with your pants down, right?  John McClane.
Go on.
Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
Didn't we have this same conversation in July?  Damn it, John, there was an opportunity out here -- I had to take it --
I'm fine.  You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.
I hear you...  Partner.  And LA's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em.
Yeah, just trying to handle some year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What do they put in these things?
Roy?  You still with us?
Hey, you couldn't know.
Al.  Man, you were my rock.  I couldn't have made it without you.
What's going on?
Is that him?
Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
This is --
What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?
I was lookin' at it.  I saw you, man!  Jesus!  You oughta see yourself!  You wouldn't believe it.
Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!
Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
It looks like a whole roast.
Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
Oh... wow!  Sonny, you're really into one mess now.
Would you do something for me? Please?
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
Yeah.
No!  They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
Look... don't throw that on me.
Leon?  Whatsa matter?  They give you a shot down the hospital or what?
Well, you got to get hold of yourself.  You got to talk to him, tell him to give himself up.
He's got eight people in there with him.  He's got this kid with him ... they're gonna shoot the people.
Somebody's got to stop him, Leon.
He needed money?  For the operation for you?
How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
Yeah.
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
Okay, give us the women.
You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ...
You got these cops outta here. They're comin' in too close.
What the fuck do you want?
Just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body ...
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
Here comes the FBI.  You men lookin' for protection?  We got all the police right here.
Hey... let him out!
Howard, give him the keys...
The gun's right on your back...
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
Why the hell did he do that?  What the hell did I do?
You see what we're dealing with? They want me to kill all of you!
Are we going to get the ball rolling?
I'll never see them again, Mister Mulvaney.
They're like any others but they're special to me.  You got kids?  You told me; you got two.
You know - I had a job once.  I used to work in a bank.  I had been training ... I used to have a boss ... Mr. Don Frio ... he wore a toupee ... I wonder if you'd hire me if I came in here and asked you for a job ...
Yeah.
Yeah.  Well, you're okay?
It's up to you ladies.
Ah, Sonny!  Good luck, you know?
Did you know he was a homosexual?
I used to, but I stopped.
Because I don't want cancer.
Go ahead.  Do what you want to do. I hate to see you break a perfect record.  You oughta take care of your body.
He's gone?
Well, I stalled him for a while. When it comes the time, then we'll work it out.  Okay?
I want him to think that.
To show that we're negotiating.
I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ...
Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
Sonny -
I never been up in a plane before.
What?
Just give me a receipt.  Hey, Sal, you okay?
First off, get the lights back on and the air conditioning.
Nobody give their right name ... it's the FBI!
Wait a minute!  What the fuck you tryin' to tell me?
Sonny!  Could you come out, please? Could you come out, please?
Okay - you got your one.
Listen, we got young girls here... you could watch your language.
What are you trying to pull?
Oh, shit!  I gotta have time to think.
My kids ... Kimmy and Jimmy.
Here's your document, Sonny.
What do you want here, Ma?  You could of watched it on TV.
Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
Why are you doing this?
You're news, Sonny ...
<i>Holy shit... this bitch is fierce.</i>
Morning.
<i>They can do subtitles.</i>
Bail jumper's name is Cookie Kincaid. Nineteen years old. His mommie posted bail when he was arrested for allegedly partaking in a drive-by shooting in Hawthorne.
Fella takes out two kids and has the audacity to not show up for trial.
Will you speak the fucking English language? The poor girl has no clue what you're talking about.  The boy speaks English, you know. Reads, writes, I swear it. He does this when he's around girls. Thinks it's cute.
Promise me... you won't ever tell Domino.
Yes.
You're breaking up... I can't hear you.
She's right... you lost your temper... and you started cursing like some ghetto skank. You lost all credibility right there!
I've already formulated a plan.
Where are you? <b> INT. CHEVY SUBURBAN -- NEXT </b> Claremont is behind the Wheel of a BLACK CHEVY SUBURBAN. He pulls into the Texaco parking lot.
We need hostages. Celebrity hostages. Just in case this gets ugly. <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- LATER ON </b> The Cast Winnebago drives through the desert.
What was your business with Lateesha that day?
<i>Now the bitch was getting personal.</i>
<i>That's my best friend. His name is Choco. He's always fancied me... but too shy to ever do anything about it.</i>
LOCUS! BABY... I'M HERE!
<i>After dad passed on, Mum's agenda was to hit the town and find another husband with a boatload of cash.</i> <b> INT. LONDON APARTMENT -- EVENING </b> Sophie is dolled up for a night on the town... CLEAVAGE spilling out of her cocktail dress. Domino is feeding her pet GOLDFISH. "THUNDERBIRDS" plays on the television.
You can save that Pretty Woman shit. The name is Domino.
Oh my God... you mean... the two of you dated?!
What the fuck is your problem? Bitch!! <b> INT. SOPHIE TROMAS MANSION -- KITCHEN -- DAY </b> Domino is loading her GUN at the kitchen table as Sophie serves breakfast. Domino wolfs it down.
Everyone... please give Domino her space. Step back, please!
We didn't sign on for this shit.  Fuck! This shit is intense. I need to call my agent.
Just like Billy Ocean says. <i>When the going gets tough...</i>
Meeka's white blood cell count is dropping fast.
You don't like Public Enemy?  It's the dope shit.
I almost had to yoke him this afternoon.  Tell me, tell me, Radio Raheem, to turn my music down. Didn't even say please.  Who the fuck he think he is?  Don Corleone and shit.
You almost knocked me down.  The word is "excuse me."
I'm gonna leave now.
Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way.
How much?
Extra cheese is two dollars. Y'know dat.
Sal, that might be fine, you own this, but rarely do I see any Italian Americans eating in here. All I've ever seen is Black folks. So since we spend much money here, we do have some say.
What did I tell ya 'bout dat noise?
Why it gotta be about jungle music and Africa?
Mookie.
No, you the man.
It's so nice to see a family hanging out together.
Squash it.
Good morning.
Ten.
I said my name is Eddie Lovell.
Fifty cents.
Jade.
How come you're not at Sal's?
Sal's gonna be mad.
I think no such a thing.  Sal pays you, you should work.
You should see the way he looks at you.  All Sal wants to do is hide the salami.
...peanuts.
Tender-headed runs in my family. You tender-headed?
I'll do.
Sal, just do me a favor, leave Jade alone.
Yeah, do you know 'em?
Mookie, I always liked you.  Not the smartest kid, but you're honest. Don't make me dislike you.
Don't even ask about your money. Your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed.
We both do.
Do we now?
Mookie?
Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over there sometime today.
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
I've been working hard, getting paid.
You a blue-moon fool.
Later for you.
What?
Where are you going?
Mookie, late again.  How many times I gotta tell you?
Just coolin'.
You talk to 'em.
You deaf or what?
Shut up.  The Boss!  Bruuucce!!!!
It's e-vit-able.
Yeah.
That's the dope.
Get the broom.
Be on guard.  Mookie has Pop conned already, so we have to look out for him.
Can you do better?  I didn't think so.  This is a respectable business.  Nuthin' wrong with it.  Get dat broom.
Pino, relax, will ya.
Then we could try something else.
Pop asked you.
Both of youse--shaddup.  This is a place of business.
No, I'm not it.
Ting tao kuun jahn leeka leeka powww.
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
Do you thill want to do an arwticle on me, Jethica?
HARRY!
Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.
Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?
Wow just like Marco Polo.
Yeah, dangerous cult. Don't make eye contact or they might talk to you.
You know, you're the first person I've brought here.
No, I just usually eat my lunch on the crapper. Saves time. Out with the old, in with the new.
H A R R Y...
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
Where did you learn that word?
Collins is a great man!
HARRY.
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
...cause you said...
Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?
You know... She's gonna be all over you like a barrel of monkeys, with her tight shirt and short skirt... Eeeww, it's so faggy I can't even talk about it.
Sure I do. On one condition.
She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her.
Do you want me to pet your head?
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
Now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
LLOYD, what are you doing? That's JESSICA and... my mom.
Wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon. And now the reward.
You're it.
It's okay. I want the rush.
Cute puppy.
You found my treasure? Why didn't you tell me.
Well, I'm listening now.
But my mom gave me the map.
Hey Lloyd. This looks like another one of your mix tapes.
Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?
Start the tape, Lloyd.
Oh, good. There's Jessica.
The one on the left.
What?
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
I thought I told you to get lost.
I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
What?
I'm so close I can feel it.
HARRY! Lloyd! You guys are a mess.
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
So I'm an "arrrrrs-hole", eh Captain Rob?
What? It's nothing, the cast comes off in six weeks.
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
Ha! Too big to make the turn!
Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...
So what do you keep in there?
Baby, I'm going to spend the morning at the mall. You know, shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are you looking for?
Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
Are you going to kill her?
My Lord!
Yes?
You must share with us. -- EMPEROR The Atreides house is building a secret army!... using a technique unknown to us... a technique involving sound. The Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad... he could threaten me.... I have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice... thus replacing their enemies the Harkonnens.... House Atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain. Then, at an appointed time Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and launch a sneak attack on House Atreides... I have promised the Baron five legions of my Sardaukar terror troops.
The Duke is to be addresses as... -- Kynes comes forward and adjusts the Duke's suit, checking seals and pulling on straps.
Dust cloud ahead, Sire.
Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
Don't you trust your own eyes.
Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.
Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning?
Don't touch my mother...
Remove her gag!
Remember... walk without rhythm and we won't attract a worm... it'll go to the thumper.
Will we see a worm?
You have strength... real strength... You shall be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar.  This is your secret name in our troop.  But you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly.
You mustn't speak of...
Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?
So <u>you</u> sleep in coffins?!
I thought it was great.  You were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
Sure.  Romance, that's great!  To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures.  Once "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another!
Ha-ha!  Dr. Acula!
No!  <u>Doctor Acula</u>!  You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor!  Not a count.
"It is my home."
Goodbye!  Goodbye!
What is this place?
Was I wrong to cast Loretta?
I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
What are you doing?
Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?
Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?
Oh.  So what is the scene about?
I've never seen anything like him!
This is gonna be Bela's laboratory, so it should be real impressive! Like one of those mad scientist movies.  I want beakers, and test tubes, and one of those electrical things that buzzes!
PLACES, EVERYONE!  ROLL CAMERA!
I got the early edition!  It was just dropped off at the newsstand.
I don't understand.
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
From today on, our lives are different!  We'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did.
I'm no good.
Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money.
Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.
That's right...
That's Tony McCoy.  He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
Dolores, wait!
I'm tired of living on the fringe.
Oh, "Dr. Acula."  I get it.  I don't like it.
Mr. Wood?!
Yeah...?
Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.
So, Mr. Johnson --
Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.
My friend, you tink Greta is first woman I ever see?  No!  Many duds, before I find her.
I can't believe it.  These sound like <u>my</u> problems!
Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?
Is there a script?
Lugosi?
Isn't he dead?
I think it's fifty-seven minutes long.
The marriage already ended.
Oh, flowers!  I didn't know you were so traditional.
Oh.  I loved those shows!  "Inner Sanctum"... "The Shadow" --
You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw.  Your friend's.
Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.
You know, when you rewrite a script, it just gets better and better!
Those assholes.
Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!
You want me to show it on my TV program?  Well I got nothing to do with that.  You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven --
Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?
Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews. I've seen ones where they didn't even like the costumes!  Like, that last "Francis the Mule" picture -- it got <u>terrible</u> notices.  But it was a huge hit.
Norma, this is Bela -- Bela, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Tor -- Tor, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Paul Paul, this is Norma.
I thought this was a group effort.
What are you, an angora wholesaler?
Well, I was wondering if maybe sometime you'd like to go out, and maybe grab some dinner.
What if I'm vomiting?
What do you love her or something?
How's your mother?
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
What?!
Oh, Al ... This is just...
You think she really likes him?
Now look. Don't freeze up on me. I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You're not going to lose that, are you?
Yes, Ed.
How you doing, Ed?
Yeah?
Yeah.
Ed, do you want my advice?
Take him off the air.
Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go!

I thought -- I thought he was dead.
Hey, if it's free, it's me.  You ready?
You know about that fireman who rescued that little girl?
Hey, he cheated on her.
He had girlfriends!
I'm at the hospital.
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
Who?
What?
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
Hi, Mom. 
What is she, at work?
I can't?
What are you doing?
Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.
Hey, Lou.
So?
Ha!
Go!
What are you doing?
You know, I never saw you in your uniform before.
It's really a tremendous turnoff.
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
I wish my stepfather was here.
Shari, I really like you...
I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
Okay.
She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. No. Not in my house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - "How do they find me" she says. Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... Oh, man... Are you all right?
It's not their fault.
You know, that would be like a great thing.
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
I'm making a tape.
Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?
Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal
What is this? What's going on, who is that?
I don't even know her. All I know is she likes Snapple.
Why me?
Look, we gotta talk.
Come on, Ma.
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
Hi, Shari.
No. Two times.
Check forging.
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
Um... They gave me a limo, uh...
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
We don't have foibles.
What does that have to do with... ?
By the X.
Yo --
what?
No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.
What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.
You gonna do it? You gonna do it?
Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
How'd it go?
Yeah. No. I mean, you know.
Having a problem with your eye there?
What?  Right.  So let's start counting.
It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
Tracy.
Looks good to me.
Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications.  I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down.  Did I do that too?
I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
Where to?
Why are you doing this?
Well, I... I... that's very nice of you.
Life would go on, and I would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience.
Walt will be speaking with you about this, but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer.
What is it. Tammy?
Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
Which door?
I can't afford this stuff right now.
Shall we give it a name?
Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Hey Yeah?
Right now?
Yeah.  I'm here.
takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.
People can see this.
But other people can see them too.
Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.
Thought what?
Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.
Merry Christmas.
Somebody hit you?
Tell me about Patchett.
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
Did they deserve it today?
But you did it anyway.
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
Look.  I want to see you again.
It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?
So you saved her.
Do you like being a cop, Bud?
Did you talk to Exley?
Lad, may I have a word with you?
Will you work for me?
You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell.  You're not your old, cruel self anymore.  I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp.
Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.
Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good.
Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.
What's through here?
Yeah, that's Stens.
What happened?
Why?
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
Dudley.
What?
It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.
Bud...
You wanted to meet here?
I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
Richard Stensland.
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
What do you mean?
Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't make lieutenant until he was 33.
Jack Vincennes.  He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir.  He lives for it. That's the way to get him.
I got the rap sheets on the black guys, sir.  Coates and Jones got charges a mile long.  But except for some kid stuff, Fontaine's clean.
More or less.
Where are the police academy files?
Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
Okay so we worked together.  It was an information exchange.  I got him first class collars and he got me good stories.  We were friends for Chrissakes!
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships.
And?
No.
No.
I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father.
You should stay away from a man when his blood is up.
You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?
Have you discussed this with anyone else, John?
You're the key witness?
I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?
Damnit...
I need to speak to you.
Damnit... <u>What</u>?
Even I'm not that crazy.
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
What are you going to do?
I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.
Lynn Bracken.
Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
I'm curious about you.
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
On what evidence?
Okay!  You're right!  Dudley's got photos of me and Reynolds.
Let my Susie rest in peace!
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance?
Loew didn't go with him.  You're sure?
Yeah.  Me and Patchett go way back.
Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
What happened?
I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
That's who they are.
You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
What'd I tell you?
I didn't use my name.
It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.
Gimme that.
We lost 'em.
I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
Nah, they'd shut down the pin number.
How?
--Don't think it could've gone any better. Tell me, how's Deb? How're my grandchildren?
Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.
It's a little late for that.
I think she'll like this very much.
I know, but--
A police report.
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before he died. I thought you might know something.
You tell me.
Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
Anything at all?
I don't know what's goin' on with Zavitz, but that was way, <u>way</u> outa line.  You understand?
You should take this seriously.
What?
What do you mean?
Have you been working with Rachel?
Stacy?
Stacy, I found out like this. This is the first I'm <u>hearing</u> of--
It's not true.
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
The date stamp on the picture is last <u>month</u>. Is that where you and Rachel conduct business.
Stacy, don't hang up.
I know.
It wasn't me.
I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
Who?
Maybe it's not connected yet.
What can I do for you?
Is this a fuckin' joke?
Why the hell would I--
You don't know who the fuck--
You're goddam right you jumped the gun.
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand. You wanna fuckin' <u>what</u>?
Actually, that's not true.
It is fish.
Never.
How can I be sure.
I got a call from my firm this morning saying don't come in.
I know.
Rachel--
I can't.
What makes you think it's you?
Diane, maybe you didn't hear Mr. Silverberg. They've got models that'll try on the garments.  Thank you, sir.
Well until we find, you're gonna have to take a leave of absence.
Well that's why I'm here, Mr. Dean. 'Cause you're a labor lawyer.
She doesn't want to talk to you.
Excuse me, have any of you seen an eight year old boy, good looking, about yea-big.
You're learning a cruel lesson.
Who won the fight?
It's okay to use the phone.
They took the espresso machine. The <i>espresso</i> machine, Jerry! Which makes sense, you know, because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo.
No.
No, but they took my blender.
Can I talk to you a second?
Ssh!
My stuff's all over her apartment.
I don't know. I mean--
No, I--
To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.
Are you okay?
I'm not asking you to say for certain. This is what you're trained to do, right?
Then what's your goddam opinion?
What?
Am I to understand--
We'd have to--
He's arrogant and threatening. Voice stress points suggest he's worrying.
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
No sir.
What about--
Jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body.
Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary.
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
Thank you.
I can't sing.  but I can tell a story.  I might need a prompt.  Do you have your Herodotus?  I've noticed you carry it…
They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
You felt obliged to.
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
This is not very good, is it?
Say you're sick.
This is - what is this?
It's beautiful.  What's it about?
Madox knows, I think.  He's tried to warn me.  He keeps talking about Anna Karenina.  I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat.  Its my idea of a man-to-man chat.
I don't care to bargain.  It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing.
Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet. She nods, can't find this funny.
Why did he bring you?
And a good read.  Don't waste it.
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
Oops!  Mustn't say International. Dirty word.  Filthy word.  His Majesty! Die Führer!  Il Duce.
Good morning!
I see.
If I could just see some identification.
What did you think you were doing in his tent?
What did you do?
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
I believe I'm rather late.
May God make safety your companion.
How are you?
Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
Is this you?
I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.
You have to protect yourself from sadness.  This is the thing I've learned.  You're in love with him, aren't you? Your patient.  Do you think he's a saint or something?  Because of the way he looks?  I don't think he is.
Where did you find that?
I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
Is it you?  If I said Moose… I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you?
First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
So, I come across the Hospital Convoy  I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.
But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him.  And hearing his story, she said this -
Marvelous plane.  Did you look?
And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons.
There was a Prince, who was dying, and he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills. Am I that Prince? Hana laughs.
What was all the banging?  Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
How?  How can you see anything?
I can see my wife in that view.
He needn't disturb you.
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
Good morning.  Did you know that?  You're always singing?
Arguing about books.
Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
I'm still here.
There's meant to be lace in the next village - the boys are taking me.
I'm not sewing anything else for you!
It's okay - I'll help.  Please.
No. But he hands them over.
If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?
It's what I've learned.
He's gone, hasn't he?
Hello.
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
I was looking forward to this evening.
Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!
What are you talking about?
You didn't answer the beeper either.
We've got to catch him in the act.
I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
You don't call, you don't write.
Don't overestimate yourself.
I can't?
Like I would have art in my suitcase.
You're shaking. Are you nervous?
Very nice.
It's a fake.
But--
I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake.
That's entrapment.
I don't believe this.
And--
Only a week?
Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.
Why don't we take oxygen?
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
You were afraid of heights?
He wasn't.
And--
We did it.
You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in.
What?
The Mask. Where is it?
Do you know what you've done!? Do you know?
What about the rules?
Well...What are we doing?
Peoples China Bank.
The oscilloscope's already programmed.
That's where the Mask comes in.
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
Done.  And I assume you have the magic CD- ROM?
No way to take another day or two?
You shouldn't have.
So what are you going to do with your share?
Four billion dollars.
I'm going to disappear. I die in a car crash in Taiwan. Very easy to do.
Don't panic, now, there's no rush...
Jesus.
What's wrong.
A true master. Classic, yet extremely sexual, don't you think?
Gin, really.
In the van.
Oh, it is.
I said a masked ball, not a costume party.
So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.
Tonight your league night?
She's calling the shots now.
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
Mr. Masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28- billion dollar corporation.
Tony Marvin.
His dry cleaners.  You want him?
Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor.  Jesus.  Look at me. What do I have this afternoon?
So.  You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon.
This is a real nice place you got here.
I added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ...
I know.  They're more than a bit unusual. See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's disease.  That's a kind of cancer --
So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
Are you kidding?  With how our lives are, if I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk.  I just kept all PG&E correspondence in one place.
You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole family.  And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  They just took care of it.  Just like that.  We never even saw a bill.
Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have been so sick --
It's a good day.  I feel good.
And get someone to help around the house.
Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
I'm sorry, Erin.
Yeah?
Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays.
Come on, I'm trying to help here.
Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?
So what's the story on this thing?  This cancer stuff?
I didn't see any medical records in there.
I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?
Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.
And this shit is bad news, Mr. Masry.  Not only does it attack every organ of the body, it fucks with your DNA, too.  That means these people's genes, and the genes of their kids, and the genes of their grandkids --
You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.
What now?
They covered 'em over.  And not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock.
Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here.  This is some damn good work.
Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.
What do you mean?
Oh, they knew.  They had to know.
Hey.  I like working with you.
Hey.  A new plaintiff called, wants to meet you.  I told him we'd be out there Thursday.
What kind of truck?
Is that what you want?
Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?
Counts?
You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --
The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says --
Why not?
Ed, I swear, I'm not --
Two million dollars?
I've also been thinking about the team. Responsibilities, who should cover what --
I was working in the compressor, and out of nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the office and says, we're gonna give you a shredder machine, and send you on down to the warehouse.  We want you to get rid of all the documents stored out there.
Nope.  And I didn't ask.
And you were told to destroy those?
How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
Pattee?  That your middle name?
You're married.
Hey, Ross.  Tell me something.  Does PG&E pay you to cover their ass, or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
County water board.  All righty, thanks.
You've been reading for hours.
Hey, Ros.  Nice view, huh?
God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you doing out here?
We'll work out the roller hockey thing, okay?  Whatever you want, we'll work it out. I promise.
She's one of the sick people?
Excuse me -- Theresa, was it?  There are no holes in my research.
Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?
You're not nothing, Erin.
What's going on?  What are you doing?
Think you could learn?
I'm embarrassed.
I mean, it's not a problem or anything, but -- I'm just a little unclear on what those things are.  I thought maybe you'd know.
I know.  It's an awful lot.
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
What?
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
... and when I realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too.  So I went and asked.
Uh-huh.  Spent the last few days knocking on doors.  And you know what?  They're not.  I mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff.  And their pets are fine.  So I don't know -- I just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water.
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
Yes, My Lord.
Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.
He will learn patience.
Told you, I did.  Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse.
I can't ...
You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
Barks his concern.
Barks his consternation.
... Like we're being watched.
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't.  So ...
I don't want your help.  I want my lamp back.  I'll need it in this slimy mudhole.
... I told you, I'm not hungry.
Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
What is thy bidding, My Master?
He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
Good, and Commander Skywalker?
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
I think we're in trouble.
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ...
I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
Am I?  I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss.
Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.
You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.
Hey!  Someone's still in here.
Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.
But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
They're moving away.
Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.
What are you afraid of?
Are you crazy!
Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
I see it Chewie, hang on.
Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.
What'd you have in mind for your next move?
I don't like this.
You look silly.
He found him in a junk pile ...
No thanks.
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
I hope you make your peace with Jabba.
Why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you.
This ought to be good.
No.
You'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.
I knew that set-up was too good to last .... I'm going to miss it.
Someone's falling.
Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.
Rather touchy, aren't they.
Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...
The Bacta are growing well.  The scars should be gone in a day or so.  Does it still hurt?
Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?
Where are you going?
My mind fills with so many images.
They're my friends.
There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!
Yes, My Lord.
Did you call the Zoo?
Me, too.  Can't have a lot of monkeys making messes in the Guardhouse.  Have we fed them?  Like raw steak or something?
Go easy, Stevie.
You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.
Who's that?
I tried...
Give it.
I thought he was, but he came back.
Oh Cuervo...
Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?
All right, so I made another deal.
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
Defense against what?
So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
Not you?
Stop the damn car.
I said pull over.
Where are they going?
Cease fire with the bullshit.
Aw, come on, Snake.
I got an idea, Snake.  This looks like the prototype, right?
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
Could be a big one comin' any minute now...
You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help.  You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up.
Who?
I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going.
Where's the anti-toxin...?
The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
Good day to you, sir.
These men repented before God for their evil deeds. Those who would not, met their fate at the end of my sword.  Accept the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift.
They miss the battlefield. I think we do too.
Merlin, will I live...?  ...I was dreaming...
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
Whose son am I?
What book is that?
What?!
A king must marry, after all.
At your service, sir.
Yes.
I cannot offer you the land, only my love...
Sir... Kay needed a sword. His was stolen. I saw Excalibur, and... I took it.
But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores...
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.
And you cannot love me...
Who does it serve?
Who?!
To me? But why?
I showed you all my conjuring tricks...
--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
Behold the sword of power, Excalibur. Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to Thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow.  Speak the words.
You're convinced that it's genuine.
Let's see whose around. In the meantime I'll call you as soon as I know.
Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes.  Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.
It's serious?
May I ask...?
You were expecting a deliver y that day?
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
Excuse me Miss?
A man to see you.
Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?
A disorder of the nerves. At least we think it is. We don't know yet exactly how it works, but it's often seen in earl adolescence. She shows all the symptoms: the hyperactivity; the temper; her performance in math.
A stimulant.
Well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter-
Well, It's a symptom of a type of desturbance in the chemico- electrical activity of the brain. In the case of your daughter in the temperal lobe, up here in the lateral part of the brain. It's rare, but it does cause bizarre hallucinations and usually just before a convulsion.
Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
Didn't tell you of what she did?
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
To begin with it could make things worse.
No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-
Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
Is she gonna die?
Hey, where'd this come from?
Where?
You really don't want me to play huh?
Captain Howdy, Do you think my mom's pretty? Captain Howdy? Captain Howdy that isn't very nice.
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
I don't want it.
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
Hi Chris. Great party.
She doesn't remeber a thing.
Goodbye Father. I call you.
Oh Christ! I should of been there and I wasn't there, I should've been there.
I get passes. In fact I got a pass for The Crest tomorrow night. Would you like to go?
Hello Regan. I'm a friend of your mother, I'd like to help you.
You and Regan?
You speak Latin?
Quod nomen mihi est?
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
I'm all right.
Now momma you have to stay off it, you can't keep go up and down those stairs you have to give it rest.
Dimmy, you worry for something?
No.
Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation.
Save your servant
And let my cry come unto thee.
...and to redeem through your son. Who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the holy spirit, God forever and ever.
Father Karras? Father Karras? Damien? The reponse please Damien!
What is it?
You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?
I know. I read it. These desecration's in the church…you think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards.
It's possible. Possible however…
Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient.
Stick your cock up her ass! You mother fucking, worthless cocksucker!
It's my goddamn car!
Give me the keys.
Frankie.
I've got the grands for two nights, Charlie.  You can't just --
Beasley.
They gotta go.
Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!
Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore. Jack. He goes by Jack.
Oh, look at you two.  So skinny. And those tiny suits ...
What's the gig?
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
Don't make trouble, all right?
You're their uncle.
What d'ya got?
Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?
No, I mean it.
So what'd we get her?
Frank?
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
So you'll come out, right?
The hell you don't.
That's what we agreed.
Where the hell is she?
I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.
You hit me.
No.
Make it collect.
Better take care of your fingers, little brother. Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'Chopsticks.'
Yeah.
November.  '71.
She was staying at the Grand downtown ...
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
We're gonna be here a week?
Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like a kid.
What's the matter with you?
How dare you say you love me.
Really.
How's it coming?
How long you been at it?
Funny, huh?
You saw wrong.
April.
A useless talent.
I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?
I could've.  But he didn't want me to.
That takes care of this week.  The tenth we got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the Capri.
What're you doing?
Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?
Basketballs, Frank.  You had us playing for basketballs.
Jack!
Hey, what do you know.  Looks like we can have that drink after all.  What's your pleasure?  We got the downtown Ramada. We got the Travelodge on Route 41. And ... the Mallory.
Charlie called.
Christ, that's right.  How could I forget.  What a nightmare.
Actually, that's my stage name.
No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
How should I take it?
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
Terrific.  Thirty-eight.
I sing now?
Come on.  We don't have much time.
Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.
Nine.
Shoes?
Oh, thanks.
Right.
Jack, you with us?
Maybe it's legit.
Virgins?
Hey, we're connected.
Great?
You're kidding me.
Wow. You ever see her again?
I can't sing it anymore.
Is that important?
Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.
Funny hours.
No.
No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning. He needed some work on his mouth.
All right.  Hold on.
Is that the way it is?
Yes, well, it's probably best. No sense bringing someone else in.
Hey, he's not sore, is he?
Fucking.
He takes after our mother.
Aren't the kids asleep?
Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.
What'd I say?
He had a mind that escalated things.
I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.
Frank said ---
Shit.  I think I started a fire.
So ... ?
Vegetables.
From Hurley's?
None?
Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
Don't they ever let us take these boots off?
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
Where am I?
You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
I hear you're a manicurist now -- got your own business and everything.  I'm glad you've stayed clean.
Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge.
And this thing can grow it?
So?
I was in a coma, Pollux. I still feel like shit.
Do you know what it is to be in a coma?  It fucks up everything -- including your memory! I can't even tell you why Dobbs jumped me yesterday!
Oh, God -- Mom OD'd at County General.
Thanks, Pollux.
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
What are you saying?  Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ...
I know you -- you're the one who called.  You're Castor Troy.  You killed my son --
You can't go.  You can't be anywhere near that place.
I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
How's Loomis?
Which ear was it?
Jon, this is goddam insane. You can't go through with it.  What about Eve?
Now what?
This is it, Jon.  For the next 72 hours -- you're on your own.
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
You'll what?
You better be nice, Castor. You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone.
Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.
We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out.
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
There's my little darling.  The night wouldn't be complete without you.
Oh -- Commander.  I didn't see you ...
Kim?
-- I'll be one of the most powerful men in the country. Didn't matter how much cash I made pulling wet jobs -- I was still too low on the food chain -- always with somebody like Jon Archer after me.  The best part is -- I'm the GOOD guy.
Don't get mad, but I just went for a little stroll through the company switches.
We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
You'd have to start immediately.
As much as ever.  Nothing.
So -- how long will you be gone this time?
... That's great.
What are you doing?
Where's Jamie?
You too?  This holiday's about giving, Adelle.  And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone...  Lifesaver?
Kate Reynolds...
No...
Good for you. Why shouldn’t you protect what’s yours.
Excuse me?
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
Try not to be late because kids don’t like to be the last one picked up.
Not bad...I shoulda warned you.  Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
Maybe there’s a jewelry store back at the mall. I could get her a pair of earrings or something.
I know, I moved the Barca-lounger into the corner.  It’s throwin’ everybody off.  What do you think?
What am I saying?  You don’t need to hear that...  All I meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, that’s all.  Is that you?
She is relentless.
Look, maybe I’m not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one.  A little flirtation’s harmless but you’re playing with fire here.  The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor.  You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.
C’mon, Evelyn Thompson’s got no class.  She doesn’t marry Dr. Steve, the woman’s living in a trailer.
Hey, you can’t park that thing here.
I don’t care if you’re Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still can’t park here.
So you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe I shouldn't do this, I shoulda done that.
What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
You just said everyone needs something.
Look, I'm not saying you'd be able to do it without some hard work...
It’s a glimpse, Jacko.
What’s this, a signal? Will you come whenever I ring it?
I’ve got kids, I’m going home...
...06...14...18...48...right there.  Four numbers...that's two hundred and thirty eight dollar...  Merry Christmas and shit...
Merry Christmas to you, sir...
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
Merry Christmas, Mr. Campbell.
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
I can't seem to let go of you...
Where were you?
What are you doing?
Why not?
She’s your dog, Jack.
Fine, she’s the kid’s dog.  Let’s go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
Hello!
How can you do that?
I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if I’m lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere?  I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...I’m sick of it.
Well...Annie for one.
Thank you...
Jack.
Maybe I should wait...
You are so not off the hook yet, slick.
My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and you’ve seen my pay check.
Good things...
You’re talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.
Don’t do that...
You’re not married, are you?
Mrs. Peterson.
Peter.  I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
Peter Lassiter...
For one thing, you like expensive things.
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.
You don't know what it's like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring, whispering --
I mean...
I don't think She's real big on hate.
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
Those yours too?
Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
Isn't that <u>your</u> speech?
This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there.
The shields on the station should protect us.
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
We had a tough year.
It's about to be a broken face.
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Hey!  That's a <u>prototype</u>!
I'll be watching over you.
Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben?
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
You look like an eighties rock band.
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
What?
Victor's right.  Johnny, get to the command center.  Close the shields.
He's not responsive --
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
What?  No.  I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
He's right.  These costumes are... missing something.  I can't put my finger on it --
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
I though we went over this.
You're on fire!
What is that <i>thing</i>?
Leonard, how's the feed?
How's the IPO?
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Come on, Ben, come on...
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
What are you doing here?
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
That's good.  That's uh...good.
You're <u>happy</u> for me and Victor.
For science.
Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field.  That's what you projected on the Bridge.
What are you doing?
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
What's going on?
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us <u>worse</u>, maybe even kill us.
Grant's uniquely qualified for this mission. He's a Communications Expert and was a Frogman during the War. Besides, he brought Benes into this country, and the fewer people who know about him, the better. At any rate, you'll find Grant invaluable, should anything go wrong once you're under way.  Okay, Don.
Okay to proceed.
But we have no choice! We've got, to take them out!
Doctor...without killing him -- how long could we stop his heart?
They're in the Pulmonary Artery.
Time's up... We'll have to take them out immediately.
Hello, Grant. Good to see you again.
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
This is Dr. Duval, our Head Surgeon.
Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us.
Yes, we'd like to get moving.
I can't imagine how it possibly could have come loose. I distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts --
Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.
Yes, a fistula too small to show up on the X-rays.
Cora, is something wrong with the laser?
He's making a fine recovery.
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
Shouldn't you answer that?
A surgeon might...
Open it! Open it before they get here!
Thank you for saving my life.
Doctor, what's wrong?
Mind letting me in on what's going on out there?
Don't tell me they're refueling...
Isn't there another surgical procedure you can try?
About forty miles an hour.
If we can't go back, is there an alternate route?
At this size, I would certainly think so.
Looks like the sea, at dawn.
I -- I don't know what to say. I know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession.
Skipper, you're picking up seaweed -- or whatever it is.
I'm in charge of this mission! You were instructed to take orders from me, not give them!
Out of your element, aren't you, Captain?
Atomic fuel?
Come on -- it's no use!
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
I'll never find my way through that.
It's a dangerous procedure. If I miss the timing, we could explode the tanks... But I'm willing to try it.
You, uh... I'm sorry, sir, but -
You're required to display temporary tags, either in the plate area or taped inside the back window.
Can I see your license and registration please?
...So I guess that's it, then.  Here's the keys -
Well, okay, it's -
Oh, Jean's okay. But there's three people up in Brainerd who aren't so okay, I'll tell ya that.
I thought you'd never ask. The older one is Janet, she's nine, and the younger one is Morgan.
He's three now. Course, not in that picture.
Yah, he -
And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. So I don't say nothin' and he says, 'What do ya think about that?'  So I says, 'Well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.'
So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.
Oh sure. They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.
Yah.
Uh-huh.
A subconscious-type thing.
And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
...What's the big deal? It's an hour -
Okay. We'll get the money together. Don't worry about it, Jerry. Now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call?
Yah.
Yeah, but -
Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering -
but do you know that for sure without -
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the -
Yah, so we're all set.
Yah, well, they exist all right.
Well, what do ya mean?
Yah.
Shep said 8:30.
...Is everything okay?
Norstars.
Wade, have ya had a chance to think about, uh, that deal I was talkin' about, those forty acres there on Wayzata?
How ya doin', Wade?
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
Heck, you don't know! You're just whistlin' Dixie here! I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this! I'm sayin' call a professional!
Yah, thanks a bunch. So what's the deal, now? Gary says triple homicide?
Where is everybody?
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
You look in his citation book?
Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?
Yah, that's me.
Okay, ya know. Okay.
...What can I get ya?
...I was married to Linda Cooksey -
Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away. She, uh...
...Hello?
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
Yah, okay. How's the hotel?
...So?
Your mallard?
I love you, Margie.
And his wife?
Oh, my.
Get your hands off him!  Get off...! What the hell do you think you're doing... ? Evidence?!  This is a man... !  You killed him!
Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You know that chest expansion program you see on TV?  That was his idea.
No.  I found something new.
I'm going to need you out-of-town a little more this week.  We've got some "red-flags" to cover.
He was full of pep.  Must've had his grande latte enema.
I must've left the original in the copy machine.
Hmm?
We need to talk.
Look, I can't cry with a faker present.
So far, you have four and I only have two!
So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day?  I want ascending bowel cancer.
Looks like this is goodbye.
Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?
In case we want to switch nights.
How did you find me?
It's time for you to leave.
You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up.
This is a sweet side of you.  Picking these up for ...  "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines." Where are they?
You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
Is that what you're calling it?
Say my name!  What's my name!?
I'm sorry, I...
Because... I'm Tyler Durden.
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
Marla...
You were in here last Thursday night.
I had everything in that bag.  My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
Thank you.
Could be worse.  A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car.
Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
Don't I?
Huh?
What?
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
I don't know about this.
Why not you?  I'm letting you go first.  Do it.
How do you feel?
My boss, probably.  Who would you fight?
The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in.
What?
"I am Joe's Lungs."  It's written in first person.  "Without me, Joe could not take in oxygen to feed his red blood cells."  There's a whole series -- "I am Joe's Prostate."
Alive or dead?
You?
Unbelievable, huh?
I mean, this girl... uh, you're not into her or anything... ?
You're sure?
You're okay with this?
What?
As the fat renders, the tallow floats to the surface.  Remember the crap they taught you in Boy Scouts.
Stop it.  This is your pain -- your burning hand.  It's right here.  Look at it.
Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
We don't need him...
What... ?
Tyler...
I asked you what you studied.
Hey.
Why wasn't I involved from the beginning?  You and I started fight club together.
Four in Milwaukee.
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
Oh, yeah.  I didn't really know my Dad...
There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  Now look what you've done!
What about Marla?
She's... you... you're fucking her.
...to let this happen!
Yes...
Fuck you.
This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
Why... why... why... ?
No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
Do something for me.
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
But, this is Project Mayhem.
What are you doing?!
Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
Animals.
Would you rather be dead?
Kimberly Burroughs, eh?  What do you want?
Yeah, how?
Please, what else could it mean?
Six duds in a row.
Jury duty?  That's randomly selected by social security numbers.
Um, Clear?  I'm sorry...about before. I...
I'm not sure I understand.
I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
You've made your point.
May we come in?
Nora's not coming.  She refuses to leave her son.
Shit, I don't have her number.  She was never interviewed.  She took off right after the accident.
Um, Kimberly?  This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down.
What is it?  What are you?
Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.
I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others.  I've got this terrible feeling.
There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day.  I can't even tell you some of the things I thought about.
Damn, it really hurts, Mom.
What on Earth are they doing?
That... him?
No.
I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like on the plane?
Carter, get out!
Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
Shoulda' felt up Tammy in the pool, that time...
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
He didn't say nothin'. Just drive.
I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did.  They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week.  Got a smoke?
Your buddy made it out last night. The place went apeshit.
Hell.  This is just like fucking Star Wars, man!
This clown almost blew mission security on the street.  I'm not jumping with him.
Again.
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ.
That's what I'm here for.
You read me, Brewer?
What's this?
Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
Roundeye.
Are they going to torture us?
Brewer!  You know what that thing's packing?
I'm Rambo.  This is Brewer.  Her name is Co.
Why's that?
Are you okay?
Christ.  How'd you get here?
Invulnerable.
Go United States.  See Nguyen. Maybe teach economics.  Buy Cadillac.  Watch "Dynasty."
Yes you can.
What was that?
What's the job?
Where?
Memo E-7 on top will cover the details.  An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp.  As you can see the intelligence is soft.  These LANDSAT photos show huts... barracks.  It could be anything.
All this is for us?
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
How long have you been setting up?
So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?
You're out of your depth, Trautman. Way out.  I'm acting correctly here. Not you.  Not your gung-ho jungle ace.  It's over.  Walk away.
What's your name?
Hello, John.
Listen up.  You two are married as of now.  Get used to it.
This will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if... you like at a membership discount.
I like your nails.  Where did you get them done?
I've never been in an apartment above a store.  You always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them.
Will it hurt?
Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.
No really..I can't.
Most men are.
Yep! Right on it!
It happens to be a beautiful love story.  Ya know, you used to like that about me.  You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much.  That we could be together and not think...
I can't tell you how distraught I was.  All night long.  What the hell happened?
<u>What</u>!
... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This!
He's not a moron.
I... You're not going to understand this.
What are you two up to?
What do you think?
You know, I can't believe I did it. You think it'll work out?
I've got to put these tapes in some kind of order... and... Oh, I should get my sports jacket cleaned...  ... There's coffee if you want...
It's so great to see you like this, honey... I can't tell you.
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
No.
What have you been doing here!  <u>Huh</u>! <u>I wanna know</u>!  <u>What have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?
But..How could that happen?
What if I was a relative?
Where you comin' from?!
Yeah, well... I let him stay there. What else could I do after such a tragedy?
I wanna go...Just let me go...
Can you tell me something? Did you lose your mind all of a sudden or was it a slow gradual process?
About dinner as a concept or about dinner with...  <u>Raoul</u>?
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
So how do we do this?
Now what?
Free?
Where am I?
Where -- ?
... I've got a right to say something.  I mean, you're tying my hands here!  They say you're not ready to know.
Parry.
I'm not married.
Do you follow her every day?
Here...I just would like to help you. I thought...maybe...you could use some money.
I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.
Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
It's such a great song.
Don't you think it's time to go now? Running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people.
..Ha...Little fella? I mean the man talks to invisible people - he sees invisible horses - and he's naked in the middle of Central Park. I should be surprised? I'm not surprised. I'm fucking outta my mind to even be here!
Are there any questions?
Will you stand still so I can do this!
Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.
Don't say that.
Well, no wonder.  We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
See, I told you it was him...  Your name's Donnie something, right?
My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
Now quit, Bobby. You said you're goin' a help me pick a song.
How 'bout if I just cut off your damn water?
You know what, you are never satisfied.
That was damn good, wad'n it? I finally did it...
Elton and Stoney know how I feel about you. An' they're just goin' to think I'm not too nice a guy, which I'm not, an' that you're a hell of a person puttin' up with me, that's all.
I'll be gone two or three weeks.
It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.
We'll get off in Washington and hook another ride.
You don't have to tell everybody about it. Pretty soon they'll all go there and it won't be so clean.
Can I get you anything else?
We been wantin' to ask you something. Are you the guy on YV?
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.
Yeah... I guess so...
Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you...
Look, can't you see that, what I'm talking about?
You were going without saying goodbye?
Bye, now.
What have you been doing since then?
Why?
Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.
One thing that's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just walk away from it, without a second thought...
Is that funny?
Yes, it was. You've made it clear that if I can cut a little piano, I might get a little response.
It's convenient to fake looking for something right now, isn't it?
No, don't do that...
Four or five years.
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
She's tremendously gifted, this girl.
You sure you should be playing, Carl?
Oh, for chrissakes...
Robert, I think you better just...
You've been staying in a motel all this time?
What kind of doggy is that?
I don't think that's true.
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
There'd never be a hole big enough. Now took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, I was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all...
Well...
Mass production is what does it.
In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
And you know, I read where they invented this car that runs on... that runs on... when you boil water...
John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world...
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
God, you drive me crazy. I just want you to know how I feel and you don't understand.
How you treat them?
Why?
Fa what?
Wha'?
What are you going that way for?
I gotta go take a piss.
Yo! What you goin' for
Yeah, he got boxes in his stomach. He's taller than me.
I think he's 18 or 17.
Like this?
Now salsa, you know how to dance salsa?
Who?
You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair.
Where you know Amanda from?
You live around here?
Look. You know that and I know that, but somebody's bucking for a promotion. I think it's that bozo, Hanrahan, I can't be sure. Anyway, unless I go back there with something, you and your son-in-law are next week's scapegoats.
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.
That's what he said.
Hey, what are you doing?
Fletch!
You're lucky.
Fletch F. Fletch
For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...
Ask anybody.
Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?
Greetings, everyone.
This one's going to be even more fun.
What the hell are you doing here?
Fat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy. It began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.
Two bs?
No children?
Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
Is she ever. I've got some stories....
Thought so. What for?
You gonna nail the chief?
Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort.
Oh, God, I think I'm about to hyperventilate. Have you got a paper bag, or something.
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
Are you serious?
Read this, please.
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attaché cases.
I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk. Actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by Alan Stanwyk, who I believe is your son.
I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?
Sure you did.
Where does the Chief get the drugs?
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot himself in the game room. That just blew it for me.
I have the same problem with my help.
Will you kill me?
'Magic' today, huh?
W-Y-K no 'c.' I'll be down in a minute.
'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh?
We used to fly together. I'm... John.
Hi.
Lunch...
All this goes on Underhill's bill?
Why'd you let me in?
Good point.
What about his parents?
I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
He's a bad guy, Mrs. Stanwyk. Gail. I think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me.
What are you talking about?
I was afraid you'd say that.
What's wrong, Gail?
What is this....
You can't do that.
I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.'
Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?
One.
Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
Your call is come through.
What did you want under the bed?
I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.
No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it.
More cops.  I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank.
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight.
I was upset.
Yes?
Sorry about the glass.  And the house.  And the breath.
No thanks.  I carry my own.
Ah, the Dorothy Chandler.  I was just there with my good friend Art Mooney the other night...
They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.
Jonathan was such a beautiful man. No one knew him like I did... Excuse me.  I can't do this now. I'll call you tomorrow.
Art Mo-o-o-ney!
You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs.  Why didn't you jump on her?  What's happening to you?
Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
You wish.
That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...
Tonight after I see Don. Some Beverly Hillbilly just hired me to find you-know-fucking-who. Name's Colleen Sutton.
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
I'm sorry, that dress.  What do you say we...
I don't know, what was the case?
Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?
Three hundred.
Let's get serious...
Because I know rock-n-roll.
Zuzu Petals, you're not bad.  In fact, I was discussing this whole rock-n-roll thing with my pal Art Mooney the other day.  You know him?
My axe!
Suck a dick, I left my purse...
I can't kill this kid's father...
Gut feeling.
I got something serious to dis-cuss.
This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.
Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
Yeah, go on...
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
What are you running from?
'Booty Time.'
It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame.
Feel my thumb?  I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  I leave.  Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
Jazz, we're talking here.
Uh, nice piano.  Probably get a lot of complaints from the neighbors -- heh...  It's another time, Julian, another place.  If I told you Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and Colleen Sutton were the ones you were complaining about, the ones who tried to rip you off, what would your reaction be?
It doesn't have to be like this?
<u>Okay</u>!  Okay.  You got me.  Boy, you guys are tough.  I have the third disc.  Indeed.  I.  Do. Yes, sir.  Yeah you assholes, it's in a very safe place with instructions to have it sent directly to the police if I don't make a phone call by seven o'clock.  So if you'll excuse us...
I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?
Shit.
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Who knows?
Where are you?
What's your name, asshole?
What?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Did they follow you?
Twelve o'clock... yes...
Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
Il est en retard.
Une erreur!  C'est génial.  C'est une vedette à la télévision.  Il peut aller partout sans être soupçonné... En plus il a besoin de fric.
I'm afraid they've become a bit... over-cautious.  Our American friends.
If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.
You're in show business.
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.
There may be two... no, three who could fit it.
What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin' from the cops?
That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in the subway and you blew our cover. If they haven't moved already they're not gonna move now.
Who stuck up the laundromat?
I'm goin' check on this address in the Bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass.
Popeye.
What happened to you?
Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? How good are the warrants?
What about Sal?
Same car.
Can you use a new suit for Christmans?
Where'd you get this fag shit?
There are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs, handling about a thousand vehicles a month.  Those that aren't claimed are auctioned here once a month.
I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.
It was a crematorium.
You're shitting me!
Oh, man.  Hope it ain't like this in Baltimore tomorrow.
How about a little of the King?
Damn.
Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.
Lucky throw, fire boy.
What is going on here, Satch?  What are those guys doing out there?
415 Greenwich St.  #302.  Under the body of a murdered woman.
In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?
Where are you transmitting from?
...WB2YXB calling unidentified station, Queens.  CQ 15.
What'd you say your name was?
Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?
You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live?
What's going on?
1998...?  This is wrong.  Who are you? Why are you doing this?
What's that?
When?
Dad...?
Dad, you there?  You okay?
Dad, I gotta tell you this...cause you should know.  Cause I still remember.
Are you alright"?
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
Whatta we do now?
What else, John.  It must be different, huh?  Are people living on the moon?
Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?
Hang on a sec, John.
I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this.
He took your wallet?
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
Dad, what the hell is going on?
I'm here, Dad.  I'm here.
C'mon, man.  Get inside.  I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo.
Go in where?
How you feeling?
Huh?
Maybe you outta lay off a little...
This is getting real old, John.  And I'm tired up to here with it...
She makes ten.
Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.
What?
I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
So how'd you like LION KING?
You used to be on the job?
The 2-3.  Homicide.
What're you gonna do?
Think you can figure it out?
What're you doin'?
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
Maybe we should do some exercise.
What's the matter?!
You haven't changed a bit.  Always so sure of yourself.  Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.
Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.
Look what I found.  Remember these?
What do you mean?
And, what about us?
Faster!  Eat faster!
Please... be cool.
This is no time to celebrate!
Bullseye!
You've just learned a valuable lesson.  A beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone.
If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.
Will you hurry up!  I gotta get this fuckmobile back before Horace finds out I took it.
Jason who?
Rick.  Keep and eye on our wacko kid.  I'll be back as soon as I can.
Okay, give it back.
Sorry, Megan.  Not this time.
Lake Forest Green?
You mean you had a bad dream.
...Good.  So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?
Where'd you get this?
You know what?  Sissy and Cort are playing jokes.  You know, trying to scare each other.
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
Which is?
I gotta show you Jason's grave.
In the media, you've frequently been described as "salty" --
Mr. Duke tonight I'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide American Casefile with incontrovertible proof of --
You have to...save...Jessica... Save Jessica and save the...
Steven buggin' you?
Jesus!
Maybe you should be moving on.
Jessica, I'm so sorry.  I...I wanted to have this cleaned up before you got here.
She's beautiful.
Are you crazy?!
How many times do you want to hear this?
That's disgusting.
Steven!
Have you seen Tamara?
I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.
A major prick.
It's not that, it's just that...  It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything.
A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll narc on us...
What are you going to do?
Tell me.
But I thought...
Where did you get that alcohol?
I thought I told you to stay away from her.
What are you doing??
Did you find Rennie?
You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how.
He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake.
You pushed me...
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
I've got the numbers.
I heard you weren't coming.
It's okay...you're going to be okay.
I didn't mean for you to go!
You have to call the police...
I used to drive a taxi.
Big mess every time.
A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
But didn't we know it would happen?
That's awful.
He carries a gun.
We're making too much of this.
He'll hate it.
What do you mean?
Great game.
I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend.
Of course I saw it.
This could be it.
Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
What?
I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
Is it?
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?
Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
What will we talk about?
I'm willing to tell you my name.
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
See, Daddy.
What else?
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
I'll have whatever she's having.
The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
Alma Wetzel.
I am really, deeply sorry.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
Who is it?
Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms.
We must have been heroic.
Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody.
I don't know.
They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm Steven. My parents are divorced.'
I was six years old the day Pesky hesitated throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first. That's when I knew the Red Sox were my team. Pity and terror.
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
Yessiree, Bob.
Finally, I get a waiter who doesn't know "Macbeth".
You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.
Is it true?
Do you think he can do it?
He's a very sweet man.
Home.
Yes.
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair.
Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
Here, you see? Even the South African papers apologize -- "a monstrous attack."
"Take a sixth step, that we may follow our vows in life."
Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
I'm sure your legs are quite as handsome as mine.
...and I knew something had to give. And I was determined to be here when it did.
What was he like?
Excuse me, baas, but how long have you been in South Africa?
I would rather march.
They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger.
We need your help!
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
Good. Good.  I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to "investigate" the new legislation.  I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed.
Assuming we are in agreement?
He's addressed this letter directly to you, has he?
Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?
You almost sound like you believe that.
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
--There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
He was afraid of being exposed.  That's why he did it.
We don't have the manpower.
It's about the Director.
What's wrong with it?
It needs work.
You really need that much?
You wish.
What an act of benevolence--a service to the community.  So that's it.  Now there's nothing between you and ignition.
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
We can't stay here.
You really had other offers?
If you say so.  The stripe.
Where are you taking her?
How are you, Jerome?
Why have you done this?
Thank you.
What will happen to the others?
What do you think?
You can wear lifts.
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
Not that.
Can that be, er, verified?  Were you alone?
Were <i>you</i> alone?
Does it have a name?
I envy you, Jerome.
What about the car?
Who are they?
What happened?
You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
I've got enough here.
Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser--
I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.
A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.
Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
What's Beynon got set up?
Just like old times?
What do you want for dinner?
How does it taste?
That's not all of it.
Really?
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
So what. I've got to give him his money. That was our end of the deal.
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
I don't want to go there.
Yeah.
Who's she?
A man helped me open it...
How much?
Okay?
We're going to make it.
Look, what you said yesterday... I guess that was right. It isn't worth anything if we don't make it together.
We got this far.
Can we make it?
Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.
Come on, come on.
That certainly makes you kind of special...
Gonna knock down a wall?
Chicago.
Two.
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
Then you do it.
Where we go in1?
Which way?
Don't you want to go to the airport?
Sure am.
What kind of car do you have, Harold?
Two years.
The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.
You can't get away from me, Albert.
Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
What did you do?  Albert?
What about the brakes?
You know what the bloody time is!  It's two o'clock in the bloody morning!
Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.  Kinnear did it.
That's not good enough.
You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
I want to talk to you later.
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
Once a week you like a gentleman?
What was bugging Frank?
He came to see Mr Kinnear.
Yes, while he was here.
And what was that?
Who's setting you up in this place?
Is he coming here?
What kind of entertaining?
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Who set it up?  Eric?
And you didn't know her last name?
Thanks for coming.
Where you going to live, then?
What you having, Jack?
Nowt.
Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.
Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine?
Did they give you a rough time?
Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know.
You're a bastard.
Are you awake?
Is he?
Thanks. So what're you doing? On your holidays?
Oh, that's nice.
Meaning what?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
They're still the same. Piss holes in the snow.
Eh? Have a drink.
Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.
Not going, Jack?
Gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself.
Put it away, Jack. You know you won't use it.
Ask me?
Four hundred?
I'll see you, then.
How about that, Jack?  Old Harry thought I was having him on.
Polacks and deadbeats.
All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens to us all.
You did?
...this shit...
I, I...I...
And it's not right to the customers.
That's right?
No.  That's absolutely right.
That's thinking.  Now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself.  He's...that's what I... that's thinking! "Who?  Who's got a steady job, a couple bucks nobody's touched, who?"
Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?
They have...
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
You haven't talked to him.
Yes.  I mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just...
Yes.
You...
That's ridiculous.
I didn't ask to be.
Why?  Why, because you only told me about it?
You need money?  Is that the...
And why is that?
Fine.
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
Everything I...you know...
They aren't?
They're inured to it.
Will you excuse...
Will you excuse us please?
Read it.  Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.  What happened here?
Who used to say that?
I meet gestapo tactics...I meet gestapo tactics...That's not right... No man has the right to..."Call an attorney," that means you're guilt... you're under sus..."Co...," he says, "cooperate" or we'll go downtown.  That's not...as long as I've...
Hey, hey, hey, easy friend.  That's the "Machine." That is Shelly "The Machine" Lev...
No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's back up here, I did...will you please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  One kicked out, one I closed...
What is this "you say"?  A deal kicks out...I got to eat.  Shit, Williamson, shit.  You...Moss... Roma...look at the sheets...look at the sheets.  Nineteen eighty, eighty-one...eighty-two...six months of eighty-two...who's there? Who's up there?
...you talk to Murray...
Yes.
The premium leads.  Yes.  I know what they cost.  John.  Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand dollars.  John?  For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets...
Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?
Alright.
I wish I could.
Wait.  Alright.  Fine.  The one.  Give me the lead.  Give me the one lead.  The best one you have.
Why?
That's alright.
How do you know I made it up?
Well, I'm saying this, Shel: usually I take the contracts to the bank.  Last night I didn't.  How did you know that?  One night in a year I left a contract on my desk. Nobody knew that but you.  Now how did you know that?  You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.  This is my job on the line, and you are going to talk to me.  Now how did you know that contract was on my desk?
I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.
He told me my share was twenty-five.
I...
I've got the check...
Rick.  Let me tell you.  Wait, we're in the...
When?
They took the leads?
Just now.
Oh, Christ.
You're a client.  I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.  I rub my head, throw me the cue "Kenilworth."
Glad to meet you.
Mr. Morton's with American Express... he's...  I can tell Jim what you do...?
What?
Rick...
I've got to talk to you.
I've got to talk to you...
My wife said I have to cancel the deal.
I don't know.  They said we have three days.  They said we have three days.
What is?
She wants her money back.
No, no.  That's just something she "said." We don't have to do that.
What...?  Say the words.
To negotiate what?  To negotiate what?
Guess what the Machine did?
What is this, your farewell speech?
Have a good trip.
Aren't you going out today?
What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's...
You've grown so tall... so tall in the last year.  You're much taller than me.
They say Fanucci has a license from Maranzalla himself to work this neighborhood.
Who is the greatest man you can think of?
What took so long?
You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man!
Deanna, will you get back into the house!
Would you like some?
You would risk your life for strangers?
I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.
Ready, Frankie.
Hey Mike, what can I say?
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
That's what I'm here for.
Jeeze, it's great you came along, Mike... You know, we've never spent a night out on the town together. I always thought you looked down on me for liking a good time.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
How is your wife, Fredo...your marriage?
&quot;Yo soy un hombre sincero...&quot; I am a sincere man, From the land of the palms...
The song.  Are you sincere with me, Fredo?
It was never Pentangeli... I've always known that.  It was Roth all along.  He talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever.
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
I didn't know it was a hit.  I swear to you I didn't know.  Johnny Ola contacted me in Beverly Hills -- said he wanted to talk.  He said you and Roth were in on some big deal, and there was a place for me in it if I could help them out. They said you were being tough on the negotiation, and if they had a little bit of help, they could close it fast and it would be good for you.
Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my.  Did you ever think of that. Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport.  Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!
I bet you can't guess what happened?
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
I wish they had.  He takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer.  But you can't kill a man like Fanucci.
The 'patrone' is here.
Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with.
Just now when Johnny Ola showed up, he asked me to leave them alone. Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian contact.  I was on the inside of ten, twenty meetings with him.  But today Mike asked me to leave, like an outsider.
Rocco!
If you need anything, just...
Mikey, I hoped...
What was it, so I'll know.
Go on, tell me.
They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.
Good.  Then you're staying.
Fifteen percent skim?
Yeah, but don't worry.
You're right.
No strings.
No one can trace anything to me; I pride myself on that.
Is he related to the witness?
Where?
I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you.  I will make changes; I can.  I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.
Where can we talk?
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
You have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy.  It's always been that way, most men frighten easy.
Are you the son of Vito Corleone?
Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas?
Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
I want you to help me take my revenge.
Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty?
Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?
We'll try.
He supports me.
What's this?
I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.
Here is the six month's increase in advance.  You needn't speak to her about it, she's a proud woman.  See me again in another six months. But of course, you'll let her keep her dog.
What makes you say that?
This looks corny.
These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny.
It's different.  He's a man.  And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.
You picked up that girl right in front of me.
Sure.  I loved it.
You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again --
Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something make you think I'm not?
Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
You and he are not doing things?
He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't.  He did it himself.
Getting to be a warm day.  A scorcher, as you Yanks call it.
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
Does that surprise you?
I never thought you were.
I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  I'd done "Show Boat." Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  "The Road Back."  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece.
Of course, they weren't nearly as bashful.  No, this room was once filled with bare buttocks.  And pricks.  Hard, arrogant pricks --
Everybody has stories to tell.
Barnett.  Was that his name? Leonard Barnett.  He came to the front straight from Harrow.  And he looked up to me.  Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters.  How strange, to be admired so blindly.  I suppose he loved me.  But chastely, like a schoolboy.
You're very clever, Mr. Boone.  You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking.  What a crazy old poof.  Why are you here?  What do you want from me?
Just go.  Please.  Why don't you go?
Very good, Clayton.  May I call you Clayton?  Or do you prefer Boone?
Oh, of course.  Clayton.  You finished your shower already?
I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.
Storm's getting worse.
So it is going to happen after all.
No.  It won't do.
You are much too human.
Just take off the fucking mask!
When you die...be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle --
I'm up.  Thanks.
Hey, Boone.
You're like a dog with a bone over this movie, Clay.
Where's Betty?
She tells me you haven't been sleeping well.
Then take the pills.
Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
I didn't ask George to invite you.
Oh no, my dear.  You look absolutely amazing.  There's no way I can compete with you.  The scene is yours.
We'll be in touch, Jimmy.
Mr. Kay, sir.
You must think I'm terrible, Hanna.
He looks plenty big.  You won't need my help if anything goes flooey.
You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?
Mr. Whale, this is such an honor. You're one of my favorite all-time directors.  I can't believe I'm meeting you.
That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.
Can that count as one question?
Just like going swimming, isn't it?
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
My monsters?
Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?
He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad...
It's about my brother ... Kip...
I'm not interested --
This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?
Get out --
They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ...
Not my girl anymore
What for?
How'd it go?
okay ...
Diane 1.
You ever feel bad about any of this?
You mean the poor --
What about him?
Most of 'em are late-model...
I miss Orville Redenbacher already --
A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. This ain't like the old days, Memphis. The profession has lost its..
Okay, okay. What about MAGNUM P.I.?
You look good...
What are you doing back?
oh.
Why didn't you tell me?
And just in case you lose your keys, good sir, I can toss in a complimentary slim-jim, free of charge ...
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
okay, sir. Let me just get the-order. Yes. We'll be doing some work out your way. We've got a power leak. And it's unsafe. We're moving residences to the... Marriott Long Beach ... Just for the night ...
Breakfast brunch -- ?
Whatcha got left ... ?
It looks just like a regular Mustang --
Cool. So you're living up North?
There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
"About what?"
What are you doing here?
You spread it out ... you move around... So's they can't touch you... so's they don't know... Shadow games and shit ...
Shadow games ...
Dad'd be proud --
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
Too early to tell. Nervous?
Come here -
I've missed you, man ...
Toby...
You boost her -- ?
Where you off to -- ?
But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here...
Now what -- ?
Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... Let's get into the vans --
Buy you a drink?
And here I am...
She's trouble --
You mentioned that in your letters
No whistles, but a Club You bring a hack -- ?
What the hell's that -- ?
Slip it in ...
Unlock your button ...
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
Hear you roar ...
Donny got shot ... A jacker ...
What are you doing... ?
Some crew you got ...
I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.
What about me?
You know what you got here?
Which way's out, man -- ?
You think I don't know? You think I like to keep this inside? But I gotta, or he'll kill the miserable bastard and he'll be there for life. It's disgusting what you have to put up with.
What? What happened?
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.
Don't go busting my balls. Okay?
No. No. The guy from downtown.
I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
Talk? To you? After what you did!
What're you doing? What about the car?
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?
I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter.
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
What happened? You okay?
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
What about the schools?
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
You got money for your bullshit television, don't you?  I gotta watch you swimming back and forth on TV all night long, don't I? You got money for that, but you don't have my money?
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.
What'll I tell Fran?
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
What fucking good are these things? They don't fit. What do I need this for? I'm not paying for this shit.
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
I You wasted eight fucking aprons on that guy. :
You know what to do?
I gotta go home.
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
Come on, relax. He's drunk.  He's been locked up for six years.
He's got your father upset. Good thing he doesn't have to go to work in the morning. Is this what he deserves?
Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.
Two weeks? That's nothin'. My Uncle Marty? Will knows him. That guy fuckin' drinks like you've never seen! One night he was drivin' back to his house on I-93-- Statie pulls him over.
Keep fuckin' with me. Watch what happens.
Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. We should go there sometime.
I don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids.  You'd prob'ly fit right in.
When's the arraignment?
Thanks, Chuck.
Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal pussy.  So, when are you done with those meetin's?
Are they hookin' you up with a job?
It's a way outta here.
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it. But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what you got! And so would any of these guys. It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years.
Okay.
Morgan, I'm not goin' to "Kelly's Roast Beef" just cause you like the take-out girl. It's fifteen minutes out of our way. MORGAN What else we gonna do we can't spare fifteen minutes?
Morgan, Let's go.
It's a good thing no one's Irish here.
Chuck, let's go.
Oh my God, I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin' to tell you.
Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.
Will you take a check?
What class did you say that was?
So why do you think I should work for the National Security Agency?
Codebreaking.
Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now how old are you?
What is it?
No, there's a limit.
I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
What's your name?  Don't you walk away from me. This is people's work, you can't graffiti here.
This rectangle is subdivided into rectangles. One edge of an inner rectangle is an integer. Can you prove that one edge of the larger rectangle is an integer?
I told you to cooperate with these people.
This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here--
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
Yes.
So who won the bet?
Hello.
You were missed.  How long has it been since we've seen each other?
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
Why me?
Not Rick? You didn't send him to Rick?
Can we do it at my office?
Would you excuse us?
Jobs doing what?
He married his cousin.
Just...take it easy, Gerry.
Oh, that's nice--
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.
Do you know when you'll be back?
I called Mel Weintraub this morning, to check for availability.
I could go for a Whopper.
That's why I love stock-car racin'. That Dale Ernhart's real good.
Well, I can see this is pointless...
Yeah, I read those.
Crayons?
No.
Why thank you.
Well, are you going out again?
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
You don't regret meetin' your wife?
They could see that I meant it.
So you might be working for Uncle Sam.
But you can't give back to them, Will.
What?
Oh, I know.
I know.
I know.
You suck.
Five minutes.
Yeah?
Sounds good, where are you now?
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...
I really don't 'date' that much.
Oh, you will?
I have twelve big brothers.
I swear to God.
Where have you been?
Promise?
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth?
I thought you said you'd show me your place.
Do you play the piano?
Not a lick. I look at a piano and I see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. They saw a piano and they could play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway Park and I can't play the piano--
I want you to come with me.
Then what are you afraid of?
Yes, I do, Will.
You doin' the hirin'?
*Some*body got to take the blame. They just *got* to hang it on somebody, you know.  An' I ain't doin' nothin' but set around.
Ready, Ma?
Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*
Maybe the road's out.
Looks like about a mile. Reckon she'll make it?
You mean that hitch-hiker? Little short fella with a pale face?
Kinda pie y'got?
Them wasn't two-for-a-cent candy.
So long.
How many men?
Two and a half cents.
Government.
That cut you got?
Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!
Lookie, Tom. We come to work here. They tell us it's gonna be fi' cents. But they was a whole lot of us, so the man says two an' a half cents. Well, a fella can't even eat on that, an' if he got kids...  So we says we won't take it. So they druv us off. Now they're payin' you five--but when they bust this strike ya think they'll pay five?
I'll tell 'em. But I don't know how. Never seen so many guys with guns. Wouldn't even let us talk today.
But we can still do it, honey.
What's the matter? What's happened?
Been doin' a job?
I didn't mean nothing.
What you mean you ain't goin'? We *got* to go. We got no place to stay.
But you can't *do* that, Grampa. This here land is goin' under the tractor. We *all* got to git out.
Easy, *easy!* You wanta bust his head wide open? Pull his arms, John.
How 'bout Granma?
Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
I like the tent better.
Maybe, but we shore takin' a beatin'.
I was so scared we was goin' away without you--and we'd never see each other again.
No, Ma I was at first--but not no more.
Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.
Didn' you get no sleep?
Ma, they comes a time when a man gets mad.
Fust thing I'll get is coffee, cause ever'body been wantin' that, an' then some flour an' bakin' powder an' meat. Better not get no side- meat right off. Save that for later. Maybe Sat'dy. Got to get some soap too. An' milk. Rosasharn's got to have some milk.
You be careful, Tommy. Don't you be stickin' your nose in anything.
They know he got hit in the face.
It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
I been thinkin' about us, too--about our people livin' like pigs, an' good rich lan' layin' fallow, or maybe one fella with a million acres, while a hundred thousan' farmers is starvin'. An' I been wonderin' if all our folks got together an' yelled--
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.
This here's a fifteen-cent loaf.
Tommy?
They gone.
Gone--  --over to your Uncle John's. The whole crowd of 'em, two weeks ago. But they can't stay there either, because John's got *his* notice to get off.
Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.
Fact of the matter, Muley, after what them dusters done to the land, the tenant system don't work no more. It don't even break even, much less show a profit. One man on a tractor can handle twelve or fourteen of these places. You just pay him a wage and take *all* the crop.
Ya know, you're the second fella talked like that. I'd like to hear some more about that.
Cut it out, Pa. He'p Al with the truck.  Don't fret, honey. You goin' to be awright.
Lemme go! I didn't go to do it!
What's these?
Now you done it! You busted it!
Yes, sir.
You do not.
--No.
I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.
Bob...
It's me. Martin Blank.
What am I gonna do?
I'd come to the realization that everything I'd based my life on was false. And that my life had no meaning.
Jesus...
So you eat-- read it everyday?
How long has it been?
What's your business?
That's part of it.
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
Yes.
Are you there?
...Let me get my coat.
Shoulda brought my gun.
Which would you rather...?
Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood.
I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
What if I come back?
Yes.
And how have you been feeling about your... work lately?
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
Is that right?
It's okay. It's Martin The door begins to open revealing Debi and Newberry.
There you go. I left it blank.
I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.
That's strictly Bàader-Meinhof stuff.
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.
Wait a minute--
Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.
Throw that away.
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia.
I bought a new rug.
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
They told me you're taking lithium, mom.
You have a headache?
Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
Marty! It's me. Paul.
No. You drove us here.
I'm a professional killer.
I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them.
So how was your first and last day of branding?
Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.
I have a way with animals.
Enjoy the day.
Shit.
Poor thing.
Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket.
Yeah.
Just make yourself comfortable.
Now, listen. I want you to stand on him.
I don't know any other way, Annie.
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
You want to take your bath?  We have to get up early tomorrow. You may not have enough time to --
No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough --
You should call your dad before it gets too late.
How long is this going to go on?
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
Grace? Is everything all right?  Can we talk?
I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.
When? Tonight?
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.
Yes. We're suing.
I saw Judith's parents while you were at the apartment...  I wanted to say something...  But I... I was so relieved that Grace was still... that it wasn't our daughter.
Aw... that's so sweet.
You've already made arrangements!?
You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
I miss you, Annie.
I thought you guys were going to call me.
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?
It's so cruel.
How's Peterson's holding up for you?
Where does this go, Diane?
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?
You don't seem to upset?
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing.
Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so --
Maybe we should give him another sedative.
... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way...  You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen!  Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?
Mixed salad.
Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.
I have some brownies left over. Want one?
It'd be a whole lot easier to pay the feed end of the month...
We thought we lost him in the snow storm... Told the kids. Had a funeral for the damn thing. Finally, snow stops. Staring to warm up. I go out and start cleaning the truck... Goddamn if that dog doesn't jump out from the back seat covered in snow... I nearly stained myself.
She gonna be long?
Where did you get Pilgrim from?
I won't tell you it'll stop feeling this bad... But I can tell you, you didn't do anything wrong... The same thing would have happened to me... or Frank... or Joe... And there's no sense in looking for a reason why things happen...  I used to try and... always came up short. I don't think the why so's important as... what we do with what we get. I remember this boy I'd see up on the Blackfeet Reservation. He was sixteen. Great kid. Strong. He'd gone swimming and dived headfirst into a rock. Snapped his neck, paralyzed him... After the accident, I'd look in on him from time to time... and he wasn't there anymore. His mind, his spirit, whatever you want to call it, it just disappeared. And what was left was nothing but anger... It's like the boy I knew just went away somewhere...
I thought your mom's coming up?
My parents are having friends from college over. They're really nice... They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.
...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!
Do you want to go around by the old road?
You want to watch some television?
What, sweetheart?
Did you notice -- no cane?
IT WAS MY TURN!
Don't be such a baby!
Is the poverty worse, now, you think?
Hey, darlin'.
Does a horse miss a saddle?
You know, Rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together.
As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder.   Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.
What's that?
Shit!
Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!
I want it to have my children!
Yeah?
And what's he do?
Yo. Check this out guys, this is insanely great, it's got a 28.8 BPS modem!
Dead.
Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?
Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.
What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.
I found it! I found it!
Crash Override.
Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!
This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
Two days.
Jesus, I gotta save all your asses. I help, we can do it in five minutes, man.
Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there.
What the hell is going on?
Yeah.
Your slave?
Make it our first date.
You what?
It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
Oh, wow, she's great.
I can't believe they decided you won.
Uhhhmm...
Excuse me.
Mr. Belford?
We have a Zero Bug attacking all the login and overlay files.
Die, dickweeds!
You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right?
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
Any questions?
Phreak?
Yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
What the hell was that all about?
The FBI computer holds files on twenty million Americans.  I just hacked into it.
From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.
What is it? What's wrong?
Send a Flu-shot.
I'll take you down there.
Rachel! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to pick you up?
What?
When did you find this out?
Can I come over after Jamie's asleep?
Are you two okay?
No, no, we have to get out of here right now.
You think she stands a chance?
Its metal, god dammit its metal.
Go!
An accident?
I've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site.
Hang on Mrs. Pierce.  Not that tie, on the other side.  That's not the only thing your eating Rachel.
Mom, please
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
Honey, I don't think their home.
Because the lights are all out.
Why wasn't I notified?
You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
Yes.
Sure it does.
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
Sure it is. I think tonight Brady was ready to make a commitment.  But now my future relationship, my engagement, my marriage, my children, your grandchildren, have all been wiped out because I have to baby sit tonight.
Jamie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I can go out with Brady tomorrow night. Its no big deal.
How about this afternoon I pick you up from school and we go get ice cream?
I'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay Jamie?
Rachel!
Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
You look sharp. You understand?
I'll be out on gateway and I doubt I'll be back before the troopers get here.
These kids aren't likely to forget.
Loomis. Haddonfield.
Sort of.
What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?
Why didn't you wait for me?
Well, are we still on for tonight?
What time?
I've already lost it.
Sure, see you later.
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
Fancy.
I don't want to.
You idiot!
Go get me a beer.
Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.
I suppose I do seem a bit sinister for a doctor.
Jesus!
Where were you? I went back to the Myers house...
Isn't that David Graham? He's cute.
Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble.
Yes, I am.
Laurie...
What about the rest of my comic books?
No...
I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.
Right.
Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now?
I'm scared!
Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. How could he get there? He can't drive.
Thorazin.
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
Pull up to the entrance!
...any sister talk?
We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi.
What are your favorite buildings, David?
Oh, yeah.
That's just --
Yeah.
No, really, I really like him a lot.
And you, you-you're going?
Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown...
And it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it.
Yeah.
So what's the, uh, problem this time?
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
Now I ca-can't remember.
Well, I'm sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear.
What I'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. I'd like to have them run some tests.
Now, don't get alarmed.  These are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than I can run here.  I mean, it's, it's nothing.
What a weirdo that guy is!  Paranoid.  What's the matter with you?
Hi, Dusty.
Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.
...with the affiliates.
We--
Oh, well, you know Frederick.  One of his moods.  Although it wasn't a bad week.  He  uh, sold a picture.
Yeah.
Hi.
Yeah, you would.
Oh, book?  Oh, no, I...  I'm killing time.  I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh...
Uh, yes!
Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
He's got like six gold records.
Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera.  An architect.
Oh!
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out.
I know she must be a really passionate person.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
And you're in love overnight?
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?
I want one with you.
No!
Are you?
You matter to me.  Completely.
It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost.
Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it?
I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is.
So?
Of what?  I'll be unconscious.
How do you know?
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
Me?
You know, you've been very nervous lately.
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
So you met somebody else?
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
But you don't have any symptoms!
It was on your shirt!
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
Yeah.  What?
Yes, please.
No.
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?
Come on.
Hi.  Where's Holly?
I hope you tell her it was your idea...
I'm okay.
Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know.  He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
Oh!
I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.
I know, I know.
That's really nice!
You've always had good taste in husbands, so...
Mh-hm.
Go right over there.
Gee.
This is the second opinion.
Hannah and I...can't have any children.  Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it--  It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!
He's such a loser!
Not this Thanksgiving, you know.
Ouch!
You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all.
...and then she just breaks down.  And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently.  I mean...
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
I know, no--  I know.
Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
Well, that...th-that's fine.
Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging.
Not so!  No.  I think I've been very supportive.  I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice.
My script?
Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems.
At least I'm open to new concepts!
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
Oh, that's putting it mildly.  We did everything but exchange gunshots.
Good.  How are you?
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
People change...you know.
Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing question?  Should I have not asked it?
Are you, are you out of work or something?
No, the reason I ask is--
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
Oh, well, God, I can imagine what you wrote.
Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...
Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and  that's this.
That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
When'd you get here?
Mickey?
Yeah.
Hi.
Why are you so upset?
Aren't you glad to see me?
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
Well.  Word gets around.
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
...how are things at the Hospital?
What have they got you doing?
...you...
That would adversely impact my income.
...aren't you afraid of me...?
Then you tell me, then.
How crazy is that.
How you doin?
Brigham.  Go.  Affirmative.  Okay, Happiness is a Green Light.  We've got Evelda in the kitchen, cooking.  The dope's D.E.A.  <u>We</u> want her on Interstate Transportation of some firecrackers.  Starling:  you've got Drumgo, you know her from before.
What, What, I can't hear you...
..who would benefit from his disappearance?  <u>No</u> one.  No one has but lost by it...
...are they hard to get?
...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.
If you would see him monument, look around you.
..It won't be long now, sir...
Agent Starling, would you come with me...?
What reaction?
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
No, I think he proffers to spend his happy hours with his playmates.
Oh, yes, what?  You'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men 
This just came in, over the transom. Fella, works for a Plastic Surgeon, Argentina.  Look here:
Not for our Doctor Lechter.  This...  Purports to be an x-ray of the hand of a ...white male...mmmm....mmmm...., after the removal of a vestigial sixth digit. Left Hand.  It purports to be the x-ray of Dr. L...
I know you did what you could.
What is that supposed to mean...?
What, you're saying she was overwrought.
Your girl's a menace.  Here, givver <u>this</u>... Getter off the street and teach her some <u>humility</u>. 
Waal...
Give it up.
Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend. What do you think?
...you told me you were studying for your examination by the <u>Studiolo</u>...
No, this is <u>pleasure</u>...
Of course, Commendatore...
My scar is a war-wound.
How could you know?
Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.
Who does not?
And you let her get away.
No, I don't get you...
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
Indeed we were.
Freud, do you know...?  Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.
ARE YOU <u>DONE</u>?
...might I make a suggestion...?
I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
What was it.  What was it, honey?
No.
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
Give me your gun...
I don't understand.
Ask me when we get home.
I know something no one knows.  He has had his finger removed.  On his left hand.  It left a scar. 
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
...a Dr. Fell.  A Brazilian, I think. Applying for Fanelli's post.
...I feel that...
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
Tell me why...?
Then tell me.
..and <u>humiliation</u>?  What is this new job they've...?
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?
Then what brings you back?
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
Yes.
I told that woman I'm an orphan.
And you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the Lechter case.
That if <u>decision</u> were a useful tool, you wouldn't <u>be</u> here.  Why are you here...?
You want some <u>advice</u>.
Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.
He was <u>shot</u>...he was shot.  On his rounds.  And... and...
But.  He was a night <u>watchman</u>.  That's what he was.  N'They brought back, his hat, his <u>badge</u>, an his <u>timeclock</u>.  N'then they took me off.  I <u>saw</u>... I saw.  Clear as day, do you, do they call it a <u>delusion</u>?  His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, bulletholes and all.
For the <u>worst</u> hurt, of course, that which will not heal, is the conviction no one cares.
Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction.  Several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  I have to ask if you've placed those bids.
Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  And because you have large resources.
My encounter.
...sir...?
Yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.
It's funny, when I first met you I thought you were such a weirdo...I still think you're a nut, but you're my nut.
I'm gay. Like you didn't know.
Pamela Anderson, Kate Moss, Halle Berry, and Fiona Apple, all naked in one room. You can do anything you want to them, except one of them has full-blown Aids, and you don't know who. And you're not allowed to use a condom.
Do you realize if the women of America would have just heard what you said...
Make it seem you have this comfortable, mysterious life and you don't give a shit whether she's a part of it. Oh, and bring up India, Talia has this obsession...  Whoa, Donald, play hard to get, not hard to want...Let Talia know that your goofy act is just something you do for the kids....
I'm in the picture on Wendy's wall. Niagara Falls. Family trip. Little Wendy foreground. Me background. What are the odds on that one?
Whew, that wasn't a period. That was an exclamation mark. You know, Hayley, behind every great woman is a great first menstruation anecdote.
Thanks, Talia...Why are you so nice to me?
Mine!
You are to be executed at Dawn anyway.  Might as well commit the crime. Go to her, Wichita...
No, they're not from Wendy.
Are we allowed to start hating "Wendy" yet..."Gee Wichita, I guess mosquitoes have always liked me."
Am-ber!  Uh...don't do that.
Man asswipe, you made my enormous cock fall off...
Stop, stop, what was I thinking...out in the wilderness.  Under the stars. I've ruined every--
Yes!  God yes!  I would tell her that I love her!  To not let anyone take away her dreams..!
Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  You can't be helped, Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished, either. But let's find out...
What in the hell did you do that for?
When were you in Niagara Falls?
I was thinking...if we could mesh my way of thinking with your way                            ] of thinking, we could really do some                        ] great counseling. It's all about                            ] the evolution of the species, we                            ] can improve...                                              ]
Are you allowed to do it more than once a night?
Excuse me, Wichita, I can't seem to reach the top shelf in the storage room. Could you...
Ronnie, I'm still a virgin.
Take a break Veronica, sit down.
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things?
Hey Veronica, how'd that Teenage Prevention T.V. Suicide thing go?
Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low-key note in Kurt's handwriting and we'll slip it into Martha Dumptruck's lunch tray.
You don't have anything <u>for</u> her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.
If you're going to openly be a bitch....
Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?
Just imagine somebody like your quasi-fat, goody-good friend Betty Finn doing a Crest commercial. No one would buy Crest.
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
You stupid cunt!
What do you want from me?
I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye Holden says his ideal job'd be making sure some kids don't fall off a cliff. He doesn't realize if you pay too much attention to the kids, you'll back off the cliff yourself.
Yeah, you know Holden Caulfield in the Catcher in the Rye wouldn't put up with their bogus nonsense.
Don't worry. We'll work something out.
Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!
So some people need different kinds of "convincing" than others....  Hey, just sign the petition!
What's your damage, Heather? You ruined my...
God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?
Probably just row on out to the middle of a lake. Bring along my sax, some tequila, and some Bach.
It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.
It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. Some genius.
And your worst enemy.
We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime. But if this was like a suicide thing.....
You're probably right..."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."
Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.
It doesn't work on small animals!
We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick.
This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
Did you miss him completely?
Did to.
Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.
Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.
Who does that new kid think he is with that coat? Bo Diddley?
We on tonight man?
Cool off, we're seniors.
Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest.
Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?
You two....
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
Heather Chandler, Kurt Kelly, and Rupert "Ram" Sweeney all had good looks and popularity, but there's one thing they didn't have: Values, Ambition, and Hope.
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
is chopping firewood in the back garden. HONORA approaches him.
accompanies Hilda into the hallway.
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
My name is Gina!
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
I wish James would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as Jesus!
But, we're all going to Heaven!
James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.
I shall call him Diello.
You'll never guess what's happened!!
John has fallen in love with me!
I'm sure they'll notice things missing.
I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
Mummy!
It's a three-act story with a tragic end.
Allison? Why can't remember what happened to my wife? Is it something I'm on that's... that's making me forget?
These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.
If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
No.
Must be nice.
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
So you're just packing it up just like that?
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
Who's Allison?
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
You could say that.
What's wrong, Trev?
Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty?
How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.
But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
And besides, I thought, to hell with it... it's okay if you only married me for my money.
Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy?
It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!
Poor Trevor.
I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm not even Catholic. I just had to tell somebody. It's like, ever since my wife died I don't know what I've actually done or what I've imagined. But I do know if one tenth of what's happening to me is reality... I've done some really awful things in my life. Things that I've... I guess I've blocked out...
Wait... what the hell is this...
Hey. Can I borrow something?
Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
And you pulled people out? You're...  a hero.
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
Sell it to him.  You get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride.  I got a job, nice apartment.  I do okay.
Hey, Bubber, c'mere!  I gotta talk to you, buddy.
That's close enough.  It's a confession.  The truth.  Jesus, I'm sorry, LaPlante.  I had the shoe, you said you didn't want, publicity because of your legal problems.
You should go in.  You're risking your life again...
What have I done?  I was dirt poor and useless... but I was honest.
You stole her purse!  While you were saving her?
Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions.  Looka those maniacs, willya?  They love you, for Chrissake!
Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .
What's going on?  "Guilty"!  What is this?
He gives a good report and I walk?
Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
Uh, his birthday, uh, May.  I think.
I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty.  Children's Hospital, on the double.
We're all assholes, Bernie?
Hey, I don't blame you for bein' sore.  I know I screwed up gettin' busted in here.  You got a right to throw me out.
What wouldja say if I toldja I ran into a burning plane an' saved a buncha people, Chick, an' risked my goddamnlife?
He waited for you three hours!
He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u> emergency.
Listen, it's important, Ev, I gotta see him, I got my reasons, very goddamn important...
I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?
"Harassed."  Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo?  The guy's a thief, he took my...
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
-- saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  What? Blackmailing...?
I snuck in.
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
You never saw that picture, huh?
Here we are.  Yeah, that's a possibility.  A movie.  Now you gwan in, tell your mother I got you back on time.  Point that out to her. She was always on my case for stuff like that.  She's still like that, right?
You remember where I said how I was gonna explain about life, buddy?  Well, the thing about life is...  it gets weird.  See people are always gonna be talking to you about "truth." Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or something and they got a supply in the closet. But what you learn as you get older is, there ain't no truth. All there is is bullshit .  Layers of it. One layer of bullshit on top of another.  So what you do in life, like when you get older, is you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer and that's <u>your</u> bullshit, so to speak.  You got that?
Instant celebrity is overwhelming to anybody.  <u>You've</u> known John Bubber all your life, you're used to him, you know you're the same human being you were before all the excitement.  So you feel like a fraud...
It's not right, Gale...
Gale!  This is for you.  I want you to know I never meant to hurt you. This will explain everything.
We're gonna wait here?  The guy could be hours.
What is it?
This guy LaPlante won an award?
She broke up with her boyfriend.  Listen, babe, we needja back. You gotta follow up on the jumper, find the human interest in the grim, unending tale of woe that pours from the wounded heart of the heartless metropolis.
There's a lot of confusion around what went on last night, it's not clear...
How'd it go?
He's right.  It's unprofessional.
Whaddaya mean what do I wanna know? I wanna know everything.  Who's this screwball LaPlante for Pete's sake, what the hell's he doing out there, auditioning for the priesthood? You're supposed to be on top of this, Gale, don't...  "Quit!"  You can't quit!  It's unprofessional!
He lost a shoe!
If I gave you the impression I hated him I didn't mean to.  I... I hate the way he <u>behaves</u>... he's selfish and self-centered and cynical...
I didn't say I thought we should have saved him..
Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you.  They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants...
Safety?
Look at that.  You can't buy better protection than that.  That there is your Man's Best Friend.
They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.
Any particular brand?
All right then.  That's important, isn't it?  -- For you to be in an "up" environment.  I'm saying you should literally take that as your <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon.
And what about work?  Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now?
I'm happy that you're working again.  As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?
As long as you keep remembering why.
On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --
I should.
Well, these are good signs -- she's broken up with him and the two of you seem to be developing quite a rapport.
I can't help you if you don't help yourself.  It's really up to you. Brooding endlessly isn't going to help matters any.
Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?
What happened?
I was thinking about our conversation the other day -- what you said about choices.
Baby, what is it?
You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?
I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
Has anyone seen Rudolf?  I don't think he came in last night.
Thank God.
Whew.
Honey --
Neil, calm down.
I know it's at the high end of our range --
You could have a pool to cool off in.
How were we -- were we cool?
Did you hear that?
How was lunch?
Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.
His secretary just confirmed.
That's not the case.
And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down --
Because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings.
You'll see that there's really much more space than the average three bedroom.
How large is your brood?
Are we gonna buy this house?
Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. I've had it.
I thought I was supposed to stay in my room.
Promise?
I'd like that.
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
Did you find a sword?  An old sword?
He had to come from somewhere.
I asked the State Department to check with our Embassies and Interpol to see if there were any similar occurrences like the bank.  Two weeks ago in London Charles Redder from the Bronx was mugged in Hyde Park.
I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
I'm gonna nail you, Nash.  That's a promise.
You'll have no need for that, Highlander.
Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
Thank you, Thomas.
As friends -- always as friends.
To ask her to dance.
I stood up first.
I think my Sarah fancies you, Conner.
This cannot be.
We had a bargain.  You promised.
Then take me with you.
Huge.
Yes.  How did you know?
You're hurt.
You're not an easy person to get to know.
That makes you uncomfortable?
That would mean they'd been trapped in there--
How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years.
He's in there!
We're holding the workers down below.
It has to be.
Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?
Oh -- I almost forgot.  Your head.
Fine -- I've waited over three centuries.  I can wait a little longer.
Do not underestimate the power of your heart.  Your dreams live there.
Good afternoon, Mr. Parker.
Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
Put our people on the scene.  Smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids.
Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.
Jen?  Are you all right?
<u>Get on the floor</u>!
There's fuckin' blood all over you!
We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot!
Jesus.  What is this?
There is no way out.
If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash.  That's how we'll stay alive.
You with the cops?
We're cool.
Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.
All three subjects are confirmed inside. Call off the house-to-house.  Okay, Dennis, I want to explain your situation --
We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
It's over now, Dennis!  Don't hurt anyone.
I'll give you these people.
You got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?
You picked a bad house to hole up in, son.
What about my father?
It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide.
The cops are comin'!
Cops want to be rich like everyone else. All we have to do is share.  And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman, we'll give'm Mars.
You have his address?
I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the <u>real</u> FBI.  This one's a fake.
Mine, too.
We can't carry him.
You leave that gun alone!
You'd better get out of here!  Kevin's coming back!
What do you want?
I can't go without Thomas.
How can we get out?
Smith!  Wake up!
I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can.
That's not enough.
One at a time!  Clear the air!  Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?
Did you find Jane and Mandy?
I'm Talley.  Who's in charge?
If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.
It's right in front of us.
Chief, Mikkelson.
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
It's mine.  Talley.
Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones.
Don't worry about what we used to be.
Slow down, Thomas.  Take it easy and talk to me.  Was your father shot?
How about you and your sister?
But I might be able to sneak into the office if they're not around.  Then I could open the disks here in my room.
I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.
I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up <u>bad</u>!
Paul, Paul, a moment please.
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
What happened?
Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office.
Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here.
You want to pay me?
Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here.
Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?
Have you requested re-enforcements?
Anything. Strong.
Excuse me, Colonel.
I don't understand.
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
What is it?
The United Nations are still here.
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
We must go to the Diplomat.
You lie.
Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
What do you mean George?
) You cannot kill them all.
Satellite feed.
Let’s go, Jock.
You are the manager?
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
The commander is not here.
This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.
Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
Do something.
Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
You could have asked for a favor.
Has Roger spoken yet?
My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children.
They are being evacuated.
Listen to me woman. I said all the whites are leaving. The French, the Italians, even the Belgian UN soldiers.
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
I have a confession. When we met...
Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime.
Rutaganda's place?
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
Twelve are dead.
What are you doing?
Where has all our beer gone?
What is this about no water?
No, I don't want you going on the street.
It's not, baby. Just a matter of minutes now, before somebody pulls the trigger --
Part of the original structure. When it was still an asylum. Guy who ran the place -- Dr. Vannacutt -- found it "inspirational." From some German cathedral a million years ago: "Driving the Demons From the Mind."
Mr. Price? Mrs. Price? Somebody? Hello??
Oh, for chrissake --
More the merrier.
Melissa!
Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.
Shouldn't somebody like, stand guard or something -- just in case?
I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.
What's down there?
Pritchett, is that you?
Pritchett!
Is she...alright?
I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --
-- you lose either way, Price --
Price!!
What --
What?
Then what the hell are we doing here?
Game, set and match, Steven. You've outdone yourself. And I know it's not good manners to ask the magician how he did it, but inquiring minds are desperate to know: just what did really happen to Ms. Marr?
They weren't loaded when I put them in there!
Steven --
You think this is fucking funny??
Please! Something! Oh-God!
-- then I guess then it had to be you. Sorry.
He was right! Pritchett was right!
This is all maybe getting a little too strange --
-- listen to me, goddamnit --
Please! I need your help.
Then who did??
It works.
Of course he did, for God's sake.  Didn't he, Mr. Pritchett?
Don't know that it does.
You should really open this place to the public, Pritchett -- a spa for people without enough stress in their lives.
Ghosts killed your father?
Excuse me?
Please.....anyone....help me?
For the love of God....please...?
Damn it.
Did you find something?
How did you meet Dr. Shea?
Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.
Did you find her?!
Are you all right?
Good-bye.
She's down...
Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
She's down.  Help her...
Can I have this room daddy?
Did you grow up in Ireland mister?
I can't move!
Oh my God!  She's in there!
Good night Angel...
Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.
Well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it wasn't.  I'll have to call her.
Oh come on...
What will Aubrey think?
No.
A friend?
You know, I was thinking... All that stuff father Seamus said...about discord, distrust... we're doing all right, aren't we?  You don't have any doubts about me, do you?
You don't think I know?
Are you all right?
Not at all.  I'm just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be.
I think we should do it.
...at her request.  She was a very religious woman.
What...amulet?
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
Keep talking!
What's going to happen?
Do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at?
There's something in there.
Not on station time.
You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry about it.  Go.
It's ... I don't know.  First World War, right?
The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.
Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you.
No.  I'd seen him in there a few times before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've taken it from the statue.
Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
... but it is good.  You know, over to the left, you can ...
Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street?
Joey ... ?
Everything sold as is.  No guarantees. No returns.
... Let it define you.  Whatever it is. Most of the roses die behind the bar. This is the first I've given out for nearly a month.
Yes really.
But you gave me a rose ...
You see, we're not so dissimilar.
How do we start?
I miss you too.
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
That's terrible.  What a bitch.  She was obviously just using you, Terri.  Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore.
Oh thank God, you're dead...
Well, forget about it.  Hawk and I are going to Rio.  We're hurt, we're tired, and a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich.  Right, buddy?...
Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.
That's your definition of "Hard?"
Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
I'm sorr--Goddamn Mario Brothers. Goddamn Gates.  Goddamn Rutherford Auction House.  By the way, how many seconds?
Boing.  Uh, this I don t understand...
We're going in from the ground floor.
Now that's a lock.
Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.
I'm going to find out.
Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--
My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that...
The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.
This is bueno.  They had the worst ketchup in prison.....uh...
What have you been doing?
Where did you get this?
You better believe I can.  I'm sick of people telling me what I have to do.
I wanna know...
What's your favorite sport, Hawk?
So, Captain Hawk, in one of your paws you got a gold bar worth about 8 thou.  In the autre, you got lead that won't get you gelato.
Alchemy!  Is the business term of the 90's, my man!  Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  Money isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real deal!  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!
For those kind of wages, I could have built the factory in America! They're Vietnamese, can't we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts? I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide!  Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk! The Hawkster!  What do you think of the vehicle?
Get away from there, convict!
Don't I know you...
Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying Italy?  I always had a soft spot for Rome.  Did my first barehanded strangulation here.  Communist politician.
Can't you see the Mayflowers double-crossed you...
The Hoop-dee-doo!
I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
...But I guess you don't really know him any better than that board does, do ya, Miss Archuh?
A sawbuck!
Ol' satchel-butt...
-- and she's dynamite!
Hungry, anyway.
A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future --
Cigarette?
Well, I --
Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
...Certain people are --
...Huh?
...The people look like ants.
What a beautiful thought.
I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
For Pete's sake, Norville!
...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?
You mean you know about this?
Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...
...You son of a --
I filed it yesterday.
Muncie.
You can't print that!
Ya know, entry level!
I got big ideas, though!
What the heck's she doin', Lou?
...Geez.
Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down?
I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!
Anyway. Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal.
-- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins!
Not even behind your back?
You nitwit! I worked for three years on this deal!
Why you nitwit. You almost destroyed the most sensitive deal of my career!
That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid. I never did give you that--
Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine at Riverdale is really murder.
Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --
I got gas, Bennie.
He don't look wise.
But I'm Miss Jessica's nurse, Alma. You don't have to do that for me.
Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort...now, no longer.  The Holland's are a most old family, miss.  They brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and Ti-Misery.
A man, miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face.
No, miss.  He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.
If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.
Believe me, Mrs. Rand, he doesn't do this often. This is the first time I've seen him --
I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
Mrs. Rand...
I've worked with it.  I've seen cures. It is at least a hope.
Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.
That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case.
The West Indies?
It seems we are having dinner by ourselves, Miss Connell.  But I may as well introduce everyone to you, anyway.  There -- in the master's chair, sits the master -- my half-brother Paul Holland.  But you've already met him.
Yes, the redoubtable Paul.  He has the plantation, and I, as you must have noticed, have all the charm.
Bring me another, Ti-Joseph.  I have to keep the lady entertained.
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
I wish I hadn't heard --
Betsy, can I talk to you a minute?
She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.
I heard someone crying -- a woman --
Why was the maid crying?
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.
Well?
I've been waiting here for hours, trying to imagine Jessica well again -- wondering what I'd feel. I could see Jessica as she used to be, I could hear her say in that sweet mocking voice, "Paul, darling..."  The whole thing beginning all over again...
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
Wesley!
I think I do.  I've often talked a little voodoo to get medicine down a patient's throat.
But I assure you, Father Walters, Miss Connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.
I believe there's a kinder name for it, Wesley. At St. Thomas, it's called the Institute for Mental Therapy.
I tell you he hasn't and he wouldn't dare use it if he had.
Ben you know that's your territory - and I wouldn't dream to trespass - you're the expert. Hey, how do you think Paramount's gonna do with that Blatty novel, what's it called? The Exorcist?
Benjie!
Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit --
You're staring at me.
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday.
What?
The turkey in?
In the basement over at Janey and Jim's. With that weirdo Mikey. Not even a TV on. And they're on the floor and he's got his trousers down though thank goodness she's still dressed. Well, I really let him have it!  ... and Wendy came home peacefully... Hey, should I dress for the Halford's now, or - give me your -
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
That this was going to be a key party?
You're not going to --
You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and I'll catch you, that's what I think. She'll be swearing and banging against the wall and I'll catch --
I'll drive you --
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --
So how's school treating you?
Grades?
Anyone special? You know...
Um, Paul. On second thought, can you do me a favor and pretend I never said any of that.
Here.
What you been up to?
... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and --
Talking to me, dad?
Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
He's probably been waiting all night at the station.
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
-- 73
Good shit.
Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward, OK? If you don't --
Things are really rotten at home. You wouldn't believe how rotten. Janey's sick. She's unstable, I guess... it's not the right time to tell you... but that's it -- it's like I can't make her happy, the boys can't make her happy, she just doesn't --
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
You okay?
Who?
Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows.
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.
I don't like coffee.
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
Elena. Elena Hood, am I right?
Forget what?
In many ways, the church-bound tradition of the father, son, and holy ghost is simply a version of the parent-child-adult triad within us all. It's a primitive set of symbols for our inner psychology.
You ask what the point is?
Waste not Master Hood -- that was $20 for the bag.
What do you mean?
Shit. You're not planning --
Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
Would it matter?  And what's that?
Yeah.
Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?
Mikey?
Where you going?
See, no one's here. Maybe you want to go to the basement?
Why did you -- with Sandy?
I have not touched your sh--  Stuff. You watching this?
How are the parental units functioning these days?
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
Calling an individual, Charles, in New York. Confirming a social outing for Friday night.
All my model planes.
He's dead.
Want a drink?
Good.
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.
She your only sibling?
Sorry about...
No.
What are you doing here?
I'll call him now.
You know my plan of action.
That's right.
One word to I.A. and he walks.
I got it.  Don't know why I bother.  It's been broken for two years.
Did you love her?
Thought I smelled something.
I never met anyone from Seattle before.
I don't know.
My arm!
Oh?
I suppose.
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
I thought maybe we could talk some more.
What the hell do you know?
You're not following procedure.
You don't want to answer... Two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away.
My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.
The one who made you should have told you this. The one who left the old world for the new...
Claudia is dear to me. My... daughter.
We want no quarrel with him.
I couldn't prevent it.
Your melancholy eyes...
You made us what we are, didn't you?
You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
I want more.
How did you learn to write, Claudia?
He's dead, Claudia, dead.
He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He deserved to die.
The ship is sailing wihout us!
How do I look?
You don't remember? Or you never knew.
You know her?
Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink.
I lothe them! I can't stand the sight of them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I've searched for them the world over and I despise them!
What do you want from me?
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
Did I hear a yes?
Dear God, what have I done?
You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes.
Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons. Here all one needs is a pair of fangs.
You fool, what have you done?
Where are we?
We belong in hell.
Why do you do this Lestat?
Unless I make her one of us...
Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You're ill, my precious and I'm going to give you what you need to get well.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
You'll come home with me Louis? Fro a little while... until I am myself again.
And they frighten you?
You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...
What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
You said the slave had a crucifix...
The story about stakes through the heart?
But why did you tell her?
And did you lose her? Did she go?
Lestat escaped the fire!
No... it can't end like that...
But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?
What can I do for you?
It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
I thought you were out of town!
That was heart attack time, Karla.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
Say yes.
No way.
Nice move.
I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here...  We've got to get to the radio and call for help.
Julie...
We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know...
Never do that again.
I love it here.
You're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, Jules.
You've got all these theories but where is he? Where? Where's your fisherman killer?
I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
And it's been blue skies all day. It might be perfect all weekend.
What do you mean, Julie?
There was a body! I swear it!
Come on. We're gonna be okay.
Something is gonna hit your butt if you don't quit complaining.
Oooh, the mainland --
Oh, look. Another day in paradise with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss Psychotic Episode.
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.
Come on, it'll be fun.
Why? He can't help us.
Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
Well, I'm in school and --
Rio de Janeiro!
Don't really have the market for something like this...  I can go two...two-fifty.
Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period.
You guys lost?
He leave you?
Cool.
I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this --
The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.
I need your advice —— something has happened —— Mr.  Jacks ——
It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..
I'll go up and take a look at the General —- perhaps sit with him.
Goodbye.
I have not been on the island in twenty years. It is changed - changed completely. Where are the graves -- the coffins?
There was some trouble here ——the villagers on the mainland —-this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here ——broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves.
Perhaps I had better stay. I am tired.
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs --  You have only to cry out if you are ill —— or frightened.
Thea -- you're hiding something. Why do you suddenly speak of your father? You told me once you had never seen him -- didn't know him --
Thea, your choice is a very simple one. Either you want to claim him as your father, or you do not.
What is her illness?
You know that sound, Oliver?
Do you mind if I go with you?
I've seen men die drunk —- and I've seen men die of the plague.
I had a notion you had become self—appointed chaperone lately — why?
That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle —-
But they're somebody's children.
Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character? You have no family –– no children. You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.
Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? Bert, listen!  It's that fellow there –– he says he's an angel –– he's tried to hypnotize me.
What the Sam Hill you yelling for, George?
Good morning, sir.
Oh, tut, tut, tut.
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey.
What?
Hey, who's that?
Who is it?
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
I know. I know. He didn't go.
. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission –– I mean –– might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir –– and people are beginning to talk.
Yeah –– yeah –– hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
Wait now. Where do you think you're going?
Old college graduate now, huh?
Hee-haw!
Oh . . .
You're not paid to be a canary.
Mr. Gower, do you want something . . . Anything?
Is it a charge, sir?
Oh, it's wonderful.
Well, Nick, that's your name, isn't it?
Oh, well, you know what I've always talked about –– build things . . . design new buildings –– plan modern cities –– all that stuff I was talking about.
Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.
Where are you going?
Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes and walk through the grass.
I know, but . . .
Uh-huh. Breakfast is served; lunch is served; dinner . . .
Old Building and Loan pal, huh . . .
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?
Why didn't you call me?
Those Rockefellers!
And did you put the envelope in your pocket?
Just a minute –– just a minute. Now, hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right when you say my father was no business man. I know that. Why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante Building and Loan, I'll never know. But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was . . . Why, in the twenty-five years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself. Isn't that right, Uncle Billy? He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me. But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter. And what's wrong with that? Why . . . Here, you're all businessmen here. Doesn't it make them better citizens? Doesn't it make them better customers? You . . . you said . . . What'd you say just a minute ago? . . . They had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home. Wait! Wait for what? Until their children grow up and leave them? Until they're so old and broken-down that they . . . Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars? Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about . . . they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my father didn't think so. People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. Well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be!
No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
Made up your mind yet?
Well, hello.
Hot dog! Just like an organ.
I'll take it. And then what?
Ouch!
How's that?
About what?
My mother just called you? Well, how did she know?
George . . . George . . . George . . .
Hi.
You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you . . .  . . . Your what?
George Bailey lassos stork.
Mary! Mary!
Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
Pop, can I have the car? I'm going to take over a lot of plates and things.
Yeah, it's her job.
Who's that?  Quick -- I'm in love.
Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me or I will kick your ass, do you hear me?
I thought you said she was going with us?
What is it?  What's there?
Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone.
About 10 degrees off your star- board bow, take a heading leeward of Sand Island, and lay her north by northeast....
Do I have to?
Michael.
Jesus, don't freeze on me.  What about the others?
Dad, I'm sorry....
Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in Montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he....
There is nothing to discuss.
The what?
The shark that did this.  It was a shark, wasn't it?
Do you?
Okay, so that's it.
Let's get the kid home.
Hey!  That's my boss!
Thank you.  I'll tell him.
In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies.  Call the cops.  What are we, immune?
Hi.  I closed a sale today, without Len.  That's $1200 commission, if the papers go through.
Hello, hello.  It went well, I thought.
And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one.
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
Where the hell is Air One?
Did he raise the Kids?
Yeah?  Then what?
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
I told you, remember?
What's wrong?
My cousin will be here tomorrow.
She just likes to tease.  I think she really likes you.
Get a dance yet?
The wind drift is lateral.
Come on back up here!
What're we going to do in the mean time?
Right after, the Kids went out?
All of them.  Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang.
Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go, then you can't go.  Neither of you can go.
How much longer?
What's the lighthouse?
I thought you were grounded.
Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone!
I don't think she's such hot stuff.
Not tonight.
They're turning around.
Do I have to play with the little kids?
You're going sailing.
So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace, plain and simple.
Sure am.
Yeah.
That macho pompous English --
It's his work.
They're coming with us?
Let's head to the gate and work our way back.
... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?
Swim where?  Out there?  Oh, no, forget it, not me!  You go, I'm staying.
What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.
Don't think about it.  It's over.
After what happened to us?
Change your mind?
You amaze me.  I'm more scared than you.
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
So?
What's the big deal?  A shark got Overman, and we got the shark.
What do you mean, we don't?
That's what I've come to ask you. Is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing?
Come on!
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
Are you okay?
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
I told you, something's upset them.
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
You were quite daring in capturing him.  Very skillful indeed.
Philip.
Sharks have to keep moving.  They can never stop or they'll suffocate. If water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die.
He's big as a bloody bus!
When did this happen?
I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.
I was seeing this guy off.  He flew in from Dallas.  Wants to marry me.  He's okay, but Texans are so possessive.
'Course they're also so rich.
I'm a water-skier.
Well, I needed a cold shower.
Herpes?
No...  It can't be.
Let's go, let's go!
What're you doing later?
I don't talk that way.
Gotta sneeze.
Did you see that?
Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?
No, South Georgia.
The world's southern most reaches.
Let us know as soon as you have anything.
In a restaurant.  You sit there and they swim around you.
How is he?  Still fighting crime?
He taught us good, though, didn't he, Sean?  We were lucky to grow up the way we did.
Come on, let's go.
Mike, this is fantastic.  I mean, you're responsible for building all this.  What a job you've done! Maybe I'll quit school and come down here and work with you. Brody Brothers Construction. We've always wanted to do that together.  Boat building.
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
She still talking to you?
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
Come on, sweetheart....
You said it wasn't polite to interrupt people....
I've always wanted to ride one of those....
Like mother, like son....
Make a list.
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
What the hell are we arguing about?
Close the door.
The doctor said she should be all right...She's in shock....
Sweetheart....
Henny Youngman....
Give it some time, Ellen...See what happens.
We have three months of work and approximately no money left to support it....
What the hell's it doing in warm water anyway...?
They won't kill it....
Don't be late.
In a minute....
Yes!
You're damn right I'm serious....
There's never been a great white where we live.  It's warm water... They don't like it....
Oh, it looks like my uncle's.  He taught me how to sail when I was a kid....
I didn't mean to start that....
How are you doing?
You're having a good time....
It's not easy.  None of it is.  I have to find some way to get on with my life and I'm going to try.  I finally figured that out.  I'm going to do my best....
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
Depends on where you want to go....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
I'll get it back next time.
What happened?
Yeah....
You tagging them...?
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
Maybe I missed you too....
How many?
Trouble with you, Jake, is you have no sense of humor....
Okay.. .we're done, man....
Okay...we got it together....
I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
You sure you've done this before?
Bring her to starboard.
Who?
You getting a reading on them?
'A Moray eel....'
Holy Christ....
Your equipment has crapped out again....
I'll do it, Jake.
Jake.
Don't go weak in the knees on me tonight....
Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....
That bad, huh?
I'll take care of it.
I'm glad of it. I'd rather please you than anybody I know of. Oh, darlin', will you give me something?
Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.
What? Whatta you mean, no? Who is -- who is telling you? Whatta you mean, no? Yes, you'll wear pink or else. Or else you'll wear pink.  And, darlin', oh, I'm gonna take you to Coney Island.
As I said, Sergeant, you nearly ran into <u>me</u>? What's the problem?
The van?
Did you bring it with you?
What about that kid, Ross?
What do you think?
It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..
You want my advice?
Because I dislike her too much ..
I haven't got it.
I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that.
Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head.
That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.
No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.
Stop it.
You gotta stop calling Los Angeles .. You're dragging L.A. around with you like an addiction.  Look at the shit you're putting yourself through? For what? For <u>nothing</u>, I know it, I been there. Remember me? Up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes?  If there's a body under the snow, <u>fuck</u> <u>it</u>. Let somebody else worry about it. You gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this ..
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
That's a very stupid question, Ross.
Ease off, John ..
Can't thank you enough, Ross ..
Yeah .. I guess she's in the kit- chen .. We got a so-called prof- essional cook out there having a nervous breakdown over a turkey ..
Jesus. What are you doin?
What exactly you doing, John?
Now?
Why did he ask if it was frozen?
You're pushing this too hard. It's like you <u>want</u> me to say <u>stop</u>? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?
I never asked if he could "see." I just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything?
John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John?
Can I see your hands?
D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?
I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
I suppose I'm the worst witness you've ever had?
I'm sorry, someone slammed the door on me. I couldn't get out.
Just your age.
Don't say that. Don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>I believe you</u>  ..
You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart ..
Who sought the warrant?
Interview over, Blattis ...
Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about ..
Yeah, I guess I do.
What was she like?
You think John would like it?
Bobby's out .. What's the hurry?
You can drive down there, Sir ..
Good.  They're all heatseekers!  All of them, everybody. You keep one superstar and they'll all follow. There's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, Jerry Maguire, was you.
I have to finish my job --
Jerry.  You and I are salespeople. We sell --
Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now.
Didn't hear it.
I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work.
Oh Jerry.
Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?
Now what did you lose?
Oh tsht. Yes.
Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
No, that's fine.  What calls came in today?
It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.
Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222.
Beer okay?
No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
Well, good evening.
I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.
It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
Another time, okay Dorothy?
What --
Why do you love me?
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
I don't need you to "stick."
Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
I don't like to give up.
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
That's the girl I love.
Forgot your keys --
No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry.
I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.
Denver is where he should be.
What happened to Denver?
Hey, I'm learning as I go.
Now.  Wait.  You didn't actually sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me you didn't sign.  Because I'm still sort of moved by your "my word is stronger'n oak" thing --
At last I find you.
You love me now, don't you?
What are you doing with me, Rod?
See this jacket I'm wearing?  You like it?  I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on "do not do this" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!
You are not allowed to act this way.
Did you tell him about the "ten million for four years?"
--  the kwan.
"Love me love me love me... put me on t.v."  That's the iconography of rascism, man!
The kid is amazing.
I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.
I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers.
For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For love, you get married.
Beautiful.
That's when you need to cement, and define define define.
How can I make your life better?
He took a shot.  He's unconscious.
-- I give you my favorite animal in the zoo.  Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of...
Oh, my God.
First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, Amanda and I have admired your work for years.
Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors. Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2, the Nile...
...once-in-a-lifetime.
How much weight have you lost?
You look good.
What?
I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
What?...WHAT!?
My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.
I thought we weren't suppose to yell.
He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, that’s where he's headed.
PAUL!
Where's Dad?
I don’t know.
Eric!
That does sound lucky.
Listen Alan, I really appreciate you bringing me along.
They never got that big.
Anything good?
The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.
We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.
See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of highly qualified...
That's hard to believe.
Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy.
We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.
No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island.
Amanda!
Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?
You hear something?
"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be light, it has to be strong --
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
What?
Are you out of your mind?  I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?
InGen is a genetics corporation, isn't it?
But he's the head of InGen!
I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
Well, is he?
How could you possibly?
Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge, and when I'm not around, Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job, and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions, you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here, or in a swamp, or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay?
What is that?
Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?
She's gutty.
Do you see any family resemblance here?
?!
We can't stay in here!
This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!
Head for the roof!
How many rounds did you find for that weapon?
No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact.
You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
Can you set up?
All right.  I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will too.  Do you have enough to publish?
Ian.  It's guano.
Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already!
That little black line?
Give it more morphine!
Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
We're talking, my dear, about a calculated risk, which is the only option left to us.  We will never find the command NEDRY used.  He covered his tracks far too well, and I think it's obvious he's not coming back.  So shutting down the system - -
Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -
That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
Yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.
Alan, these aren't bones anymore.
But you know, I should  really be the one going .
And what are those?
Why would they care what we think?
Ellie, we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply, they're totally wrong!  This is a warm-blooded creature.  They're totally wrong.
You've got a T-rex!?  He's got a T-rex!  A T-rex!  He said he's- -
Oh, shit.
Oh Ellie.  It's so beautiful.  It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
Elm that's it, it explains the periodicity, the - -
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. Especially the big one.  We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  That one - -when she looks at you, you can see she's thinking  working things out.  She's the reason we have to feed 'em like this. She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.
It's all right.
Uh - - thumb!  The same way.
Alan, listen to this.
Unpredictability....
Can we chance moving him?
Hola, Juanito
What's this I hear at the airportŠ Hammond's not even here?
I can't see.
And we can charge anything we want!  Two thousand a day, ten thousand a day - - people will pay it!  And then there's the merchandising - -
I read your book.
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
'Course you could just wait in there while we go back and get help.
It's okay to call them brontosaurs, Tim.  It's a great name.  It's a romantic name.  It means "thunder lizard".
Are you crazy?  What if you miss?  I hate it up here.
to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.
Keep absolutely still - - it's vision's based on movement!
Hey, we were saving that!
Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
Blood temperature feels like high eighties.
Tim, Tim, Tim....
All night?
I think perhaps I'll just sit down.  I don't suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?
I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.
You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
What's going to happen to the goat?  He's going to eat the goat?!
You tell them if they come up to seventy-five, I'll cut them in on the Crystal Lake package.
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.
I think we're lost.
Structure might be salvageable... let's see what the interior looks like.
I don't know...
Other guy?
What?
Three.  Where's my client?
Ruby... this guy almost took out an entire Tactical Response Team. You can't expect me to just leave you --
Now... I think the video store's open for another couple of hours. Let's go.
You watch this garbage?
"Zombie Sluts From Beyond the Grave."
If we could prove that Jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition...
How do we prove it?
Cute waitresses?
Fascinating.
You saw him?
If I'm right, this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood.  That means that Jason might've been Krueger's first victim.
You know how to use one of those?
Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.
How long will the effect last?
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide.
These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?
-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.
It's my last and final one.
In an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all.
Oh, don't they?  I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.
You've been with the firm for nearly nine years.  You've done your work diligently, there are no complaints on that score.  But there's more to the job than the work -- there are other people to consider -- and frankly, Kafka, we eel your social situation could bear improving.
I did not realize it was obligatory.
Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
The <u>Orlac</u> claim.
I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
I'm sorry, but I just wondered --
The day he died, Eduard was called up to the Castle.  Did you know that?
And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered.
You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
He wasn't a lonely man, though.
Maybe it's true then what she said.
I didn't realize you'd been here that long.
What's the matter with you?
My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything.
Why are you so aggressively unimaginative?  Eduard is no longer the only casualty.
-- Gabriela, on the other hand, had made an enemy of this man Burgel.
Through a very unfortunate -- and I might add extremely rare -- mishap, a document intended for the one department was sent to the other.  And for the first time -- though your friend wasn't aware of it -- two and two could have been put together to make one.
-- You seem amused.
-- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency.
May I ask where your two warders are?
The fact that it's live bodies you practice your trade on doesn't seem to matter to you.
Wait a minute.  "Raban?"  Where have I heard that name?
I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.
This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
It's not our fault.  We're naturally nervous.
We could go back to the office. Explain ourselves to the Chief Clerk.
Hi - Carl Denham. I'm A big admirer of your work, sir. I've loved all your discoveries. I really want to work closely with you on this incredible find. It'll be good for you and good for me.
Can I see the map? My father spoke of references to a Beast God ...
Father It's somewhere south-west of here - we need to inform the museum ... · organize an expedition -
He's grubbing for money, father.
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
Can you fly?
Yeah! Life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.
I want to thank you.
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
There's no island there. We're wasting our time!
Hey! I thought these things were supposed to be extinct!
I'm calling a wrap. We're heading back to the ship.
Bree -- honey - please, we're waiting for someone.
Guess!
-- I have to close up now. Leave your name and number with his message service, Mrs. Daniel, and why don't you just go home and wait until he --
Well I have to close up now.
Yes indeed.
You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
Oh no.
Who?
Gee.
Why?
Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it.
If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
Is that how you get most of your dates? Someone gives your name to someone else?
Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
Can't you get him?
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
I thought you were going back to the apartment.
Is there anything more I could --
What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
You asked if there was anything more you could help me with.
I've checked the records of Jane McKenna's death -- I can't get anything special. But Frank Ligourin had another girl you said, besides McKenna and you.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
You and I -- a relationship.
Oh look what he did in them.
I called Trina.
You wanted to, or you are?
Then, close the case.
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
Some mistake perhaps that --
That who?
You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.
I can't follow you.
No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.
All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
About his letters -- that's all she remembered. Quite violent material, I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. But that's not unusual either.
I know Tom Grunemann.
What do you have here, Billy?
That's Kim...and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin.
Oh, sure.  Here, this can be mommy.
Welcome to the greatest show on earth.
On earth.
You forgot the milk.
What about my orange juice?
Uh, huh...
You're late.
Okay...Same as usual...
Well, I see the Yankees finally won a game.
Look, I'm sorry I yelled, okay?
Salisbury steak.
Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
Not on your life.  That's it. I've had it with crap around this house.  From now on, no more pizza!  Get it?  Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being!
Ohhh...Ohhhh...Ohhhhh...
Objection.
Are you going to get remarried?
Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father.  Now there is a man who is very wise.  He's called a judge.  And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with.
Bigger than a principal.  The judge sits in robes in a big chair.. The judge has thought a lot about us, about you and me and your mom, and he has decided...  ...he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment.  And I'm very lucky.  Because even though you'll live with your mom Joanna I'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month.
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
Sustained.
Are you introducing the question of negligence here, counselor?
This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell the court how long you were married?
Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?
And what is your present salary?
Mr. Kramer, why did you set up residence in New York?
Objection, your honor.  The answer is, to be generous, very vague.
So do I.
Objection, your honor!  Counsel is harassing the witness.
Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you were married seven years. Is that correct?
In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way.
Did he ever fail to provide for you?
Is that...permanent?
Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.
My American Express...My Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My check book--
You just don't get it, do you?  I - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.
I'm not taking him with me.
Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
Joanna, go be a mother.  Get married, have kids.  Don't get married, have kids.  Do whatever you want.  I don't give a damn. Just leave me out of it--and leave my baby out of it.
Ted, when we got married it was because I was twenty-seven years old and I thought I should get married and...when I had Billy it was because I thought I should have a baby...and I guess all I did was mess up my life and your life and--
After I left...when I was in California, I began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child. It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy--I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me.  Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him...And I did ...And I won.  Only...it was just another "should."  ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did, everything you went through... Something happened.  I guess it doesn't matter how much I love him, or how much you love him. I guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for Billy.  I don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway... Ted, I think Billy should stay with you...
Only can I still see him?
Hey, what's the rush?  C'mon, walk me a couple of blocks.
Jesus Christ.  That's a real blockbuster.  I always figured you guys had it made.
Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--
'Night, Jim.
Disappointing.  It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum, and...ah...they're not very happy and...Well, the guys have decided they want to...ah, re-think the entire concept and...Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But...I mean, what I mean is...ah, I'm going to have to...ah, let you go--
And?
You want to know why?  I'll tell you why...  Another scotch and soda for the gentleman.  I'll tell you exactly why. Because you're not his buddy anymore.  Because he can't count on you to sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit with him.
You dope.  O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy.  All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.
So, naturally, you assume that since Joanna left, that would be a compelling point against her, right?
And?
Mr. O'Connor called.  There's a meeting with the Revlon people in the board room and you're fifteen minutes late.
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
Jesus Christ.  Did you have to be so rough on her?
Oh, Christ!
What if I fight it?
I'll take my chances.
All right, Thelma, you want to know what's going on?  I'll tell you what's going on.  I'll tell you exactly what's going on.
Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn good life.  She's got a husband that loves her.  She's got a terrific kid.  She's got a wonderful home--
You ever think about getting married again?
How many onions does it say to use?
Thel, you ever hear from Joanna?
I didn't say I'm going to die, but if I should--
Hey, that's terrific.
All quiet?
Where are you from?
Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.
And that day, your father got better. He named you Lhamo. "The Protector."
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
Goodbye, Kundun.
You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.
How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.
Dalai Lama.
I want at all costs to avoid this. Do we have news from the delegation in China?
Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.
Your father had been very sick.
You did. We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. That day the father got better. And that day, a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. I just remembered.
Who am I?
Can I save the sheep from going to the market? So they don't die.
I am sorry for you to have to witness this, Kundun.
The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
Your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in Lhasa.
The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
Did you ever doubt it?
We are now accused of aiding the rebels. The Chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt.
Good day.
Ah, Dalai Lama, thank you for coming so late.
Do you think I must?
This little brother was terribly sweet. When he died, my mother was so sad. A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born.
What does the butter spot feel like?
She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads.
Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
You have grown up very good.
I do.
The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world. Our only hope is to fight.
Much too young.
He just <u>appeared</u>.  You have no idea how he arrived in this lake?
You can't take a cow by eminent domain.
It seems like we're getting lower.
C'mon Hector.  I know you're crazy but you can't--
I might get a shot.
Wait just a second.  You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.
And what would he do come winter?
We'd only just met.
You listen to me.  The only reason I'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar--
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
I can arrest you!!
You probably <u>do</u> want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.
Where is he?!
No way.
Where?  Where?
Where is he?
You take care.
If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?
He was an Indo-pacific.
Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?
I'm okay.
You're gonna be okay.
Same thing from Fish And Game.
He thinks they're what?
I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
Sorry.
Who taught you be be a nurse?
I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
Thing we can lift it?
Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
We might as well pack.
Are we crazy?
If I'm ever in New York...
You think?
What's that?
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake.  Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual.
What?
You have a thing against museums?
We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?
Hey!!
What was that?
Hank!
I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?
Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
Hey.
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me.
I'm not upset, Myra, okay.  I just never thought of you as a y'know...
Myra.
What'd I do?
Phone call, Clarice. It's God.
Boy, is that smart...
"Desperately random." What does he mean?
Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, Ohio. The first girl taken, but the third body found... Why?
Agent Starling! Telephone!
FBI, Catherine, you're safe.
I'm sure it's a great town, Dr. Chilton, but my instructions are to talk to Lecter and report back this afternoon.
Lecter carved up nine people - that we're sure of - and cooked his favorite bits. We've tried to study him, of course - but he's much too sophisticated for the standard tests. And my, does he hate us! Thinks I'm his nemesis... Crawford's very clever, isn't he? Using you.
He gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his, either. He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. The next plane, Officer.
Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -
But then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them. That's what Lecter was hinting!
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?
Well? Why aren't you there right now?
When I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it?  That was just smoke, Starling, I had to get rid of him. You did well in there.
The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -
He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun.
Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before.
That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -
This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve, and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric. Where, Starling, he took vocational rehab, and learned a useful trade...
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.
No, I came because we need -
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
You see a lot, Dr. Lecter. But are you strong enough to point that high- powered perception at yourself? How about it...? Look at yourself and write down the truth.  Or maybe you're afraid to.
And the questionnaire...?
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?
Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he? Apparently he likes you. And you like him, too.
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
Yes.
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
That's enough, I think. Happy hunting. Oh, and Clarice - next time you will tell me why you ran away. Shall I summarize?
Then tell me how.
What is the first and principal thing he does, what need does he serve by killing?
No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer.
I heard a strange sound...
What did you do?
So you ran away...
Examination and interview materials are confidential. We've never violated an applicant's trust, and we never will.
Look... search your own records, if you prefer. You can do it a lot faster than us, anyway. If we find Buffalo Bill through your information, I'll suppress it. Nobody has to know this hospital cooperated.
Senator Martin...! You can't trust Jack Crawford or Clarice Starling. It's such a game with these people. They're determined to get the arrest for themselves. The "collar," I think they say.
I do not remember them. I was one or two.
You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London...
And my compliments to you...
Where will we go?
What?
You do not know what you are saying!
They do not live their lives "by your leave."  ...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way.
... compliments, Mr. Poe.  Take her and get out.
Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.  They'll never make a passage north.
How far is it, scout?
Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
That is the truth!
Where do we go from here?
I don't understand!
And if we're unlucky?
It should be enough to remind you France is the enemy.
That we did. John. But the horicane  is near trapped out.
So what is it, Jack? What brings you up here?
Help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores.
You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
Does Webb not even know we are besieged?
What happened to you?
This is the signature of Webb.  And I know the temper of our men. Rather than spend the war in a French prison hulk in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end.
I have lived to see two things I never expected.  An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.
Sergeant Major!
Right - about face! March! First rank present!
We must... stop... soon. Women are... tired.  You... understand?
No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers... will receive many gifts.
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves.  Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive?
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
Are you planning on working tomorrow?
And?
Why Sixpack?
They found this?
That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
We don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and--
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!
That's an order!
Where the hell've you been?
Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system...  Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters...
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
I need more light on that, Four.
That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
Sixpack?
That was a loud one wasn't it?
Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
Shit!  He sent them all.
What are you doing?
Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.
What about our quota?
What's wrong with it?
Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit...
Give me a readout, DeJesus.
Okay, number 23's full.
Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium.
Forty-eight hours!
You got money in this tub?
I'm telling you, it's the suits!
Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?
Still bothering you?
Oooooh.  Damn!  Not so loud. Turn down the music.
At least we get time and a half.  That's in the contract.
Hey, Cobb...Man, why don't you take off your shirt and pants, man?  You should do that wearing what you're going to wear at the beach.
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
Bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can't do it.
C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...
Hey!...I feel something. It's moving!  He's alive!
We've got to get him to the infirmary.
Fuck semantics, Doc! You saying its like part DeJesus, part Sixpack, part Bowman?!
Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc...
What is it?
What is it?
Are you sure you saw something?
It saw us!
The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.
What's wrong, did you miss me?
Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.
How much did you part with?
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares about us is different. Pass your phone.
Well?
Like what?
There are no others.
I don't know what you mean.
Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted them?
Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.
Hello, John. Nice holiday?
What are you doing?
How long has he been in there, son?
It's not him, Dad.
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.

It must be this one.
My neck, Dog.  That's the last bag?
J, what's going on out there?  Get the rifle out, Charles. We're being fucked.
Well, what do you want us to do about it?
What was that, armed? What do you mean, armed? Armed with what?
That's it all done, we are off.
Well, what's going on?
There's nothing in it!
Who's this fat man, then?
Tom, this is our case.
You got it all?
You must be Eddy. JD's son.
That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred.
I will.
That's if I want to see you.
Go on.
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
I can't help you, Plank.
I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.
How much did you say it was, Tom?
Jews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom.
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.
You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will move it for you.
If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money?
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.
What's left over?'
There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them?
How many wings have they got between them?
The money, the gear!
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
You jerk--
How do you think you're going to make a living?
It's my life. If I want to fuck it up, that's my business.
And what did she do?
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
So you knew this young man before?
Did you know he was going to be there last night?
Private Johnson!
I'm very happy to hear that, Private. Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling okay, too.
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
You know the popular version of how he left town.
There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.
The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio--
Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?
You were in a fight--
Same weight I always was.
Best part of the job.
You'll get official notification when I make my decision. He is out the door--Otis pulls himself a beer as Carolyn steps back out--
Come on in--
Where'd he get all this?
I'm a colonel.
It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.
You weren't in here tonight, were you?
Same as they done in Mexico.
So how come you got into all this?
Homework?
Maybe we'll clean that thing out back up, have a barbecue next weekend. We could invite him and his wife over.
Fifteen years in El Paso.
This place is a gold mine.
You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
Mikey--
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
And if I get a shot at a promotion somewhere--
Treasure hunter?
Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth.
Now I'm just as liberal as the next guy--
--but I gotta say I think there's something to this cold climate business. I mean, you go to the beach- what do you do? Drink a few beers, wait for a fish to flop up on the sand. Can't build no civilization that way. You got a hard winter coming, though, you got to plan ahead, and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout.
You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
That where he was shot?
You get much of that in here?
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
Right.
Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
Eladio Cruz.
There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection.
Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could you bring them here?
This girl is a friend of yours?
This girl has a child?
Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!
"Mas cerveza por favor."
That's a matter of interpretation--
When we backed you--
I heard there was a bit of a fuss.
People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
I got an idea what happened.
There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--
Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
How 'bout the Sheriff?
The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!
Thank you.
Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails."
I'm Sheriff Deeds--
He had the club out on the old trail road--
He squeezed money out of you?
You gonna stay out here?
What's she singing about?
Can I get this?
How come?
Three months.
Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
Murdered him?
Something wrong?
I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since.
He's all yours.
Your mother still doesn't like me.
She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--
I should get back.
I mean what did we know about anything?
When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.
Yeah?
So what are we gonna do about this?
There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--
I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about--
Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape--
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
Uh-huh.
Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge and H.L. and all--they asked me--
I didn't want to be going around your back.
We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?
For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember dates no more. I do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. He almost took some poor fella's head off at the Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured it was time to move on.
I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich sees me talking to you.  He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole.
I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
Why?
How'd you spell that again?
D'Amour.
You don't have a clue what you're into, do you?
Who did this?
D'Amour... D'Amour... Why do I know that name?
I saw him on T.V.  Some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
Anything?
Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do to your face?
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
You don't believe me.
Sorry.  You asked.
Harry.
Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.
...yes?
What the fuck?
Crank call.  I'll get the number changed.
What about me?
Bad show last night?
Oh God.
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?
What were you doing up there?
What makes you so sure?
Where the fuck is he?
They weren't worth a damn.
Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?
Go away.
What are you, my mother?
Whose is the car?
Are you sure?
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
I like to know why things happen.
Was that Swann's idea?
I want to see Swann face to face.
Him too.
Don't bother.
Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever.
She has no real grip on reality.
That.
He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
I only wear ties for funerals.
Look, Ma, no wires.
You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.
Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
They got here before us.
You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
Maybe... I... don't...
Why's that?
He's not!  He's not!
You don't think I've got it to give?
Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to.
What are you doing here?
How long have you been married?
What do you do?
Oh, hi.
You really are having a mid-life crisis.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
Hello?
Of course.
Really?
But, I'm mean.
Oh.
You are.
You think so?
Where's your husband?
I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around?
Well, I guess she's more around your age...  You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.
Why can't it last?
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
Not all that pasta.
Oh, come on.
Hello?
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
Yeah.
I guess she's busy.
I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.
I don't know what to do.
You smell weird.
Like popcorn?
Yeah, I know you have to work the whole time, I'll probably have more fun here. I'll call Charlie and those guys.
Oh, it's nothing... I better go, I'll talk to you later.
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
I spaced out.
Nonsense, it's all of our home.  So how's work treating you?
Yes.
Quiet.  Real quiet...
Your court order, Dr. Allen.
But your patient is legally entitled to it.
You'll do it?
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
Why are you doing this to me?
Thirteen.  The last time, can you believe it?  This is how he says "Goodbye?"
Peter...Peter Kelson.
You said that malignant narcissism was not evil.
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."
You're sure?  There was nothing?
So what'd I miss?
We need to talk.
Why didn't Birdson just say so?
Peter, I believe your baptism was perverted.  Look at your certificate. Your mother was the only witness to it. Your blood-type doesn't match who you thought your father was.  Peter...I'm sorry.
You okay?
There's nothing else here.
What do you mean?
No oxygen to the brain.
Why didn't you just go along with Townsend.  Get rid of me.  I would've...
Plenty of time.
I'll be all right.  Peter, at the very end, I think Father was back.  I saw it in his eyes.
That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what."
Good seeing you again.
I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.
Yeah.
You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by "demonic voices?"
What do you mean by that?
Hey!  Mr. big shot.
Seems George isn't making too many friends in lockup.
What's the matter with you?
Parents died?
What happened?
She told me she killed them.
You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say.
What?
Don't be defensive.  I'm just surprised to see you.
That's not it.
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth?
Sorry.
Hello.
Nah.
I don't know sometimes.
A horse?
So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?
You do.
The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
Hey, munchkin.
I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.
What's up with that?
What's up?
Well, what do you know.
I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
A ride home.
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
Four.
When'd you get this?
What was that about?
I can't be nice to a fan?
Yo, where's the "D"?
I won.
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
Didn't realize you were watching the clock.
You want to go talk?
You forgot to be there.
Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.
What are the doctors saying?
Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.
Actually, I don't...
I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet.  She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking.
Cause I don't get it.
You asked me what was missing.
From basketball.
We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
And what happens when you lose?
There's so many I just can't keep track.
I look like some hoochie to you?  I found it on your floor.
You hearing me?
You don't wanna hurt your back.
Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with.
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
Lucky kid.
I ain't a damn liar.
Since we're being honest, guess I should tell you.  I'm dropping out of school and going pro.
After five years.
What surery?
Your teeth are straight.
Don, you got hit by lightning that time in Tahoe, you went on vacation, I don't think braces is a good idea --
You ok?
Call 911, Mary, do it right now.
Hello?
Uh-huh.
What do you want? Why are you here?
I don't wanna talk to you.
Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
What?
No.
About two years ago.
I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --
The gentleman who came to the door --
It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --
Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
I'm sorry, Claudia.
I don't know.  I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it.  I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.
Eight o'clock?
Billingsley's?
To not do that.  To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
It's fine.
I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
I haven't been on a date since I was married and that was three years ago....and Claudia...whatever you wanna tell me, whatever you think might scare me, won't...and I will listen...I will be a good listener to you if that's what you want...and you know, you know...I won't judge you.... I can do that sometimes, I know, but I won't...I can...listen to you and you shouldn't be scared of scaring me off or anything that you might think I'll think or on and on and just say it and I'll listen to you....
I'll take everything at face value. I'll be a good listener to you.
Say what you want and you'll see --
....now that I've met you.... Would you object to never seeing me again?
-- you the resident here?
-- can I get you?
Can you hold it?
GIVE US YOUR MONEY MAN.
DADDY, FUCK, DADDY, DON'T GET MAD AT ME. DON'T GET MAD AT ME --  JUST GIMME YOUR MONEY.
I - just - thought - that - I - didn't want - I - didn't - I - didn't -
How much you pay me for my help?
I'm trained, I'm ready to go, you wanna buy some candy to help underprivelaged youth in the --
Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?
Doc it's Janet.
I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?
You look like you've got money in your pocket.
....do you know who I am?
What?  What does that mean?
But you're alright now, so what's the what?
That's right.
This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.
I confuse melancholy and depression sometimes....
You see?
I don't have any money, Solomon. If you fire me --
I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly --
I've been a good worker --
He has Phil right now.
And do good things with her...share the thing...all that bullshit is true, y'know...find someone and hold on all that...Where's Linda?
She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.
...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...
I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?
This is so boring...so goddamn... and dying wish and all that, old man on a bed...fuck...wants one thing:
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
All it takes is one second?
-- just to clarify --
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
She lived in Tarzana.
Time's up.  Thank you for the interview.
Where are you from originally?
Why does that sound silly?
Does you mother still work?
What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
Where does that name come from?
Kind of.
He's in here.
How long...you think?
When did he go off chemo?
.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --
Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --
I AM CALM.
No I Said.
I don't know a loud crash.
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
You just woke up.  And what'd you have a party last night, the way this place looks?
Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean. Ok?  Mischief.  Now have you been doin' some drugs today?
--- What was that?
WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE --
Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
You want her right now?
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
I'm gonna need a full name, Stanley.
-- did she talk to you?
Did you tell her?
How do we do this, then?
Two years...three years...
It's over becuase...for all the the right reasons I hope, what I said.
I don't know....
But you can't say....
Yes you do.
No.
No, I'm just a friend.  What are you doing here, I mean...you know Claudia?
You should get one, I'm serious, you could get a lot of stuff out of this --
Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.
You have to go, Stanley.  You're the smartest.
This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around.  I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done..
I can't.
Let me call you a car, Linda.
listen...listen to me now, Phil: I'm sorry, sorry I slapped your face. ...because I don't know what I'm doing... ...I don't know how to do this, y'know? You understand?  y'know?  I...I'm...I do things and I fuck up and I fucked up....forgive me, ok? Can you just...
You been on Prozac long?  Dexadrine?
Pink Dot.
Partridge?
What would you like?
Bottled Water?
yeah.
Do you still want the peanut butter, bread and cigarettes ?
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
Did you piss your fuckin' pants, Stanley?
I don't wanna go, I can't do it this time.
Why didn't you answer those questions?
...oh Jesus, what the fuck...?
I think that you have to be nicer to me.
Hi.
..sorry...
..sorry...
You know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me with a belt, Stanley....  I'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if I don't, I come home without the money....
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
What is that?
I have never seen a sight more beautiful than you, tonight.
There were two.  Not one.  But two.
I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
Your birthday celebration, your Majesty?
Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
Your Majesty...
He who is not with us is against us.
Physical resemblance is but one small thing!  Louis has an arrogance, a manner --
It is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours!  It is Phillippe's as well!
You can do it.
Now.  You were saying?
But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time, but --
Bloody hell...
A simple theological discussion.
Look at us.  We are old men now.  But once we were young.  And when we saw injustice, we fought it.
No!  Stop --
I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.
And why are you so glum?
The greatest secret of life is who we truly are.  Now I must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life.  It began on the night when Louis was born.
I don't understand.  What does this have to do with...?  You carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --
He's going to kill you, Aramis.
What do we do now?
Do I look all right?
I care only about Michelle.  Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving?  I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused...
D'Artagnan!
I heard your playing.
This cannot be.  Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king!
Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
Athos!  I know life means nothing to you at this moment, but I will not let you kill yourself.
It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor!
Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?
These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle.
The room of the King's favorite mistress?
The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.
What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
I will consider it.  Now leave me.
I just left the garden, it was empty.  What did you see?
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
Aramis, Porthos and Athos too.  I know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your Majesty.  If their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. Forgive them.
... The ball... Continue.
Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
Exactly why it should be given away.
... Nothing.
Did you know... about Raoul?
What can I do for you?
He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
What do you think?
Bullshit...
You can cut the shit, asshole--
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
What the hell is this Marvosa!!
I'm going to look for him on my own. Fuck this.
Don't take any chances.  Call for back-up this time!
What's this?
It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?
Anyhow...	you wake up and she's gone. But--  --this is my favorite part--  she leaves you the keys to a brand new Beemer.
So...  to get the car back, you break into her house.
Now you listen to me hay-seed! If you don't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers, you got that!!
Did you read today's paper?
Where is he?!!
Captain?
No...
You know, you don't seem afraid of much either.  How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you?
Why did you set me up?
And what did you do?
You are drunk.  You know, it's been a long time and I'd love to catch up, but I really got to -
Jesus, man...
I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
I've got a better idea...
That was her - the girl... We have to go.
Tubbs, these people mean business.
I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.
Where are you going?
You must be going somewhere.
Are you a regular there?
What would your - boyfriend - think?
You don't seem afraid of much.
No.  It wasn't like that!
Don't you guys ever knock?
It was you who did the asking.
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
How long do I have?
Aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip pens -- which is what Lecktor has -- are transparent to infrared. The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't...
No.  The numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. It's a book code.  And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him.
Where?
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
How much do you know?
That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD.  Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes.  Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up.
And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.
What'd it say?
There has to be.
That's why the boltcutter.
He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
It's getting late and...
Get the roadblocks set on Route Three! There's an access road to the back of the house. That ought to be a second team's approach.  Will Graham and I are in an orchard due west of the house.
I'll cover the back.
Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock.
Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?
Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?
That was nice of you to think of that.
Is that you. D?
Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee...
My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
No. Reba...?
THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.  THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S.
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!
Do you know who I am, Mr. Lounds?
Do you feel privileged?
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
You did very well.  I apologize for the crude images.  Next time I'll have film stock that doesn't need lights.
Dr. Lecktor will stay in his room. That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. One wall of his room is a double barrier. I will have a chair put just outside.
Yeah...
Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in?
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
I understand he cut you pretty good...
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
Blue is cold.
Can you quit?
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
Maybe we should give it some time...
That's right.
Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
It's a precaution...  Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.
How did it happen?
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
Yes.
Why should I tell you?
I don't believe in God.
...if he's smart he'll approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. How well do you hear?
Kevlar Second Chance.
People love... comedians.
Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
I'm sorry, George...
Hi, George!  Good to hear from you!
I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony.
George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them.  But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do.  'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them.
No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.
You must take a little pleasure in it.
Andy, you're surrounded by what you create.  You are the KING of negative energy.
B-but... we saw... your neck...
Andy... we don't want the viewer to get out of their chair.  They might change the channel.
Andy... uhh... this network has a long-standing policy: The viewer must be able to see the program.
Ten.
Cue the commercial!
What do you mean?
Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously.  It was just part of the show!  It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.
Popcorn?
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??
Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
"Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?"
Look at this!  An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty!  Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy!
I, I was asked to do this material - -
This is great.  The crowd's gonna love this!  Hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive?
This is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat.
Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
I don't see any injury to your neck, Mr. Kaufman.
Positive.
Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
I'm worried about Andy.  His stress level is affecting his work.
Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback.  God, listen to this!  "It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..."
Hey, that's good!  We can make that play.  And we'll really drag it out.  You get better, you get worse... you die...
We'll need a search running.
You got the money?
Do you?
You don't, do you?
I'm tired, Trinity.  I'm tired of this war, I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship, of being cold, of eating the same fucking goop every day.  But most of all, I'm tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit.
I don't believe it!  I don't believe it!
I'm going to let you in on a little secret here.  Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One.
Thanks... for the drink.
Operator.
There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
Yes.
You can't use that until Neo is out!
Right now?
This line is tapped so I must be brief.
Do you still want to meet?
Ironically, this is not far from the truth.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?
... am I dead?
When?
Right now, we're inside a computer program?
We have only bits and pieces of information.  What we know for certain is that, at some point in the early Twenty-first Century, all of mankind was united in celebration.  Through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I.
Get some rest.  You're going to need it.
If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here?
Every attempt to fight them has ended in failure.  Only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. Unkillable.  But now I believe that is going to change.
So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
I'm going to make the call.
How...?!
Hello?
You're the Oracle?
Do you want to go somewhere and talk?
It's the question that brought you here.  You know the question just as I did.  It is a hacker's question.
What the hell is this?!
And I know that's not where you want to be.
Did you go to her?
What is it?
Is Morpheus alive?
That I would have to make a choice...
No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.
Are you all right?
Can you fly that thing.
Zion?
What are they doing to him?
How much time?
Why?
Which way?  Which way?
We need an exit!
See what I mean?  A question please...'Is this what you call living?'
And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE or CHARLIE'S PLACE...  I'd call it something like SEASON OF THE WITCH... get it?
Who's the girl?
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
Next time, bet with your own kind.
Drinks for everybody Tony...
I know but let's hear it anyway.
Nah.
Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them.
If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.
You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?
Take it.  I'm doing it for you, stupid!
Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  I don't need this aggravation.  I'm getting old.
No...I'll be ok for a week.
Out!!!!
You getting out too?
Oh Michael, look...
Charlie, this is business.
Be seeing you and Johnny tonight... here...right?
I was thinking maybe you'd do very nicely for the place.
Take a drink!
Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them?  Lock her up?
Please take it.
Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.  God willing.
Maybe, who knows.
It doesn't make any sense.  He wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
It's still sick.
Yeah...but don't worry about that now.  The Hemmingway one is first.
...He must have heard the name from those T.V.'s in the hall that were blaring all the time.  I remember GUEVARA was in town at the time. Must've heard it from there I guess...but that's funny, isn't it?
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.
Just keep him quiet.
Must have been all the liquor in him.
That's your name?
-- But he does seem very nice.
That was 'Joe'.
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
-- Black.
From the Korean War.
Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
Who's Annie?
I don't like cake.
Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.
...This shit's not bad.
Yes, sir?
...See you tomorrow night.
Well... goodnight.
We're not getting anywhere here. Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --
So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.
I'm not stepping anywhere --
'Yes'.
Have we met?
Shall we adjourn?
Why?
You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around.
Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?
I don't know where you get that idea -- the Board agreed --
And what do I get?
Well, I guess he's found one.
We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got good news.  As I was telling Drew, I've been making a little hay while the Bontecou sun was shining -- two, possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger.
I'm going to put a stop to this!
I don't want to get rich this way -- I'm going to expose you.
Obeah.
No, I come to see Doctor.
I am.
Lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_
-- And call my family, I'd like them to come over for dinner tonight.
Jennifer.
Don't bother asking, we already tried.
That's very gracious of you, Quince.
C'mon, have a drink.  You look like you need one bad as me.
You think so?  How do you know?
What are you doing here?
You act like you never had peanut butter before --
-- What kind of childhood did you have?
No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
Goodnight, Joe.
Oh goodness, no.
And I'll be a visitor.
I have to go, I'm sorry to say --
Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
Yes...
I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today.
How long have you been standing there?
No.
Almost.
-- Could you?
I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --
Will it?
You think so?
How long have I got?
...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
Good morning.
How about giving a guy a break?
I'm not everybody.
What's it like?
...I'd like to be alone for a while.
Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something.  I know I'll be seeing you.
Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.
And more.
Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
I'm sorry, Bill --
I'm not hungry.
I couldn't sleep.
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
Thanks.
-- And I'm in love with your daughter.
I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.
Then what is it?
Joe, don't do this --
The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity.  I agreed to cooperate.
Yes.
You want me to be your guide --?
'Yes' what?
Where are you?  Are you there?
What do you mean?!
The 'question' --
I am, this is it.  B Day.
...It's not over, 'til it's over.
We're all here, Bill --
Drew told me.
I don't like to interfere.
I thought you were in a meeting--?
Do you love Drew?
Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
What is it, Daddy --?
You know each other?
Uh - will that hold you, Joe?
Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
Then what is it?
Where's Joe?
Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe.
This is crazy --
Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.
I don't know, I can't say --
But what?
Nothing to be sorry about.  That's the way with men and women, isn't it?
I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --
No, it was so right it scares me.
30.
47.
66.
69.
That's it?
What can I do for you, Leonard?
Burt.
You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?
So you're holding my calls?
Shit. Wrong room.
Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
Where'd you get it?
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
Why?
You think you can bargain with me?!
Yeah.
I wasn't helping you for money.
Such as?
I did exactly what you told me. I went to		   * Dodd and I said that I didn't have				* Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything.
Give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.
Why would you do that?
Who?
What?
Don't talk about my wife.
Yes.
* Depends on if he's here in town. Or if he's moved on. See, I've got all this -			*
On the house.
I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
I can't make new memories. Everything			  * fades, nothing sticks. By the time we finish this conversation I won't remember how it started, and the next time I see you I won't know that I've ever met you before.
I'm not appealing the decision.
How can you read that again?
Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -
Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out!
I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Francisco and I'm -
Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over.
Unfinished business. What made you think I wasn't coming back?
You're living.
You don't know him?
We've got to get him out of here.
We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.
So was he scared?
Who the fuck are you?
She couldn't.
What sort of questions?
How'd you know I was in here?
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
Your name's Teddy.
What cop?
Lemon doesn't go in Gin and Tonics, darlin'.  Where ya' from?
We know these people...!
Okay.  What'd you spot...?
Just came in.  She's still alive.
I don't know.
All I want to know is the where and the when.  Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.
Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here.
The Keys?
Were you born in Havana?
Did Christmas come early this year...?
Good samba dancing...?
Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.
Where would I go?
Client got delivery.  But there were..."extras" in the back of the truck.
Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...
Hey, fuck him.
What is going on...?!
There is "undercover."  And there is "Which way is up?"
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
From whom...?
Out of...?
It's fucked up.  I'm sorry...
I gave up nothing on you guys. Don't worry.  I kept you and Rico out of it.  Only the Feds.  They're on their own...it's all their deal, anyway, so fuck 'em.
C'mon, man!
As in, your ass is dead in the water.
You mean with the flowers...?
...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
That sonofabitch!
Then what were we talking to you for?
Beg pardon, ma'am. I'm brand spanking new to this town, come from Houston, Texas, and hoping to get a look at the Statue of Liberty...
Don't know what line Morey's in, but myself now, fact is -- I'm a hustler.
Beg pardon, ma'am?
You're such a doll. I hate money, don't you? God, it's been fun.
Yeah?
Must be some mess back there.
Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty?
I can tell, can't you?
He's got taxi fare.
Maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens?
That's pretty Freudian, Joe.
I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you know that?
You don't seem like no fag...
I want you to stay, okay? I goddam invited you, didn't I?
You ain't got a chance in hell. You need threads and glitter, baby. A front, hey?
Hey, you're good! I bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried.
Where'd that come from?
Okay. Here it is. You gonna go see the doctor. I got nine bucks and twenty more Thursday and I gonna be riding high before you know it. So you gonna get you the best goddam doctor in this town and get yourself straightened out, that's what.
These guys're good drivers.
You get your first palm tree in South Carolina.
You're what?
Hell, don't cry about it!
Sometimes it seems to me time stopped twenty years ago. There was this war, there was this handsome young man with quite black hair and he was supposed to die. But he didn't. Isn't that amusing?
I'm going to Florida.
Here. Don't even thank me.
Am I tickled to find you, boy! Come on in and let's get a look at you. Turn around. Good strong back. You'll need it. So you want help -- take a seat, relax, tell me about yourself. Cowboy, huh?
Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want.
You really want to do business?
Get lost.
'Figgers.
The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
Years?
Want me to take over?
Anybody bitten?
No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
Right!  That's what we're shooting for.  Mister Davis and have been in contact with the State Department, but right now relations with the Turks aren't too good, Nixon's upset the hell out of them. Our best bet's... right here.
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
DAD!
No!  I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car.
She didn't know anything about...I wouldn't have wanted her to.
What they give you?
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
The Prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in Ankara reviewed it.
What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT! FOR WHAT!
Best way is get your ass out... any... way... you can...
But how would you get into the shaft, Jimmy?
You gotta be fucking crazy!  You got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in Section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs.
Yeah,  for the criminally insane.  I was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. It's awful. Namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time...
Hishradyo.
I think I've been poisoned.
Susan - forget it. Go get us a seat on the plane. Now.
What is it with you man, what the hell is it?
What'd the Prosecutor say?
What lawyer?
Jeremy...
Lady...
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
Go left.  Go left again till you hit the fork... Then right again. You got that?
And a right.
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
What?
You feel anything?
A mistake.
You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?
The kid...
What are you doing down here?
The lights come up, you pull the switch.
He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...
A shame.  You looked great tonight.
You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.
Honey, just leave it.
No, Jesus, no.
So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or...
Rub it on the windows!
I was just thinking how I could use a pair of pliers... and I remembered where they are...
C'mon...
You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster.
This wing configuration. I've never...
My God.
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
Shouldn't I be in a hospital?
The profanity bothers you?
Thank you so much.
I thought it was time you two should meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite beast in all the world, my sow, Misery.
I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens.
You...you dirty bird. She can't be dead. Misery Chastain cannot be dead! How could you?
Then who did?
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
I guess you don't get bothered by neighbors much.
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
Thank you for thinking of me.  Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?
Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?
Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.
It'll only take a second.
"HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE CAR!"
What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word.
Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?
Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
I hope you like it.
The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave.
Here's the list of all Sheldon's credit charges. Nothing after the Silver Creek.  Any calls?
People sure like those Misery books.
Answer me a couple things?
- pull the NO2 tank and dump it, it's potential evidence..
How I usually find you, Nyah.
Your room.
Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's upside down and backwards here.
You won.
See anything you like?
To win?
A change of plans?
Outrageous.  I won't let you take control of my company.
Nyah!
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
There it is, guys, the last of it.
Checkpoint Charlie plus 30, altitude minus two-zero-thousand.  Airspeed one-seven- niner knots..
What you got there, mate?
Well do you disagree with that?
Wrong.  All we've got to worry about is Ambrose.  Nyah will take care of Nyah.
Package away in five..four..three.. two..one...
Range is two kay.
There she is.  I got visual.
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
What are you doing here?
Where's the bloody -
I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace.  Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing.
If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
Well, then, what I am I doing here?  I assume I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..
Ask a question, you get an answer!..
Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.
And that's the only reason?
Before you are.
I want you out of Australia!  ..I don't know how much more plainly I can put it.
Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?
- you who don't have a conscience.
If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight?
In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.
If that's what you're thinking Ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane.  Locating him in time to stop something like that -
And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
Nekhorvich's boss?
Left jacket pocket confirmed.
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure..
Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!
Only four more cars.
You knew about Jim?
Did we get it?
You were in the car!
Shut up!  I saw you.  You were in the car.
Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.
Did they send you...Did they send you?
Why haven't they brought us in yet?
I'm so sorry.  Krieger was my call.  I've never worked with him.  I'm sorry, Ethan.
Kittridge...
What happened?
Ethanís right behind me.  Listen to me Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money.  Ethan takes the blame.  No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him.
Claire...Hey...
Whoís dead?
<u>Are you intact</u>?
Yes.
We've lost enough agents for one night.
Correct the actual list is safe at Langley.  "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, one of ours.
Since your father's death, your family's farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, suddenly, they're flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank. Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account -- dying slowly in America after all, can be a very expensive proposition Ethan.  So, why don't we go quietly out of here onto the plane...
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
Who are you and what are you doing here?
I gotta go in there and shut it down!
You're not going to any meeting without me.
IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!
Sorry, am I interrupting?
The package is in the open.
I'm willing to take the chance.
I thought I'd take some now.
How was Chicago?
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
Iíve got a shadow.
Abort.  Thatís an order.
..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
Jim...?
Jim, itís over.
That's what we do isn't it?
Try it again.
Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Have I been a good wife?
A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
Here.  Ti amo. 
You look tired.
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
Here.
It's temporary.
The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that I was right.
At dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me. Things are very bad in my house.
We're supposed to do fifty apples. We only got twelve done.
Yes!
What's wrong can never be made right. 
Why?
Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!
You don't have to help me.
This is good. Uhh...
Stupid yourself.
Why you talking to me?
Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
To the bed.
I'm marrying your brother!
Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
What?
Hi.
Kinda gaudy.
What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.
Loretta?
I got things to do.
What's the matter? You look crazy.
Is there anything you want to tell us, honey?
What's the matter?
Will you marry me?
Then let's set the date.
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
Alright. A month. In a month.
There's one thing about this wedding I want you to do. Call this number. It's a business number. Ask for Ronny. Invite him to the wedding.
Grandma was still alive. Chiro was still home going to school. Now he's married and gone to Florida. If you and Johnny moved in, had a baby...
How's the mother?
No. But I have a hangover.
Hi.
Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fiancé, and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident.
I know.
Don't fight.
No idea.
I'm sure she did.
Because my mother was dying! But now she's not.
When I was twenty-seven years old, in Jersey City, I asked a woman to marry me. She had red hair. She smelled a jasmine. She wore black shoes with pointy white tips.
Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?
Then why are you eating alone?
You knew that man?
People home.
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
Cosmo. Many years ago, when they told me you were marrying my sister, I was happy. When I told Rose I was marrying Rita, she was happy.
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
I don't know.
She's got it.
Burn them.
Halt!  Who goes there?
Where did you get the coconuts?
Well, this is a temperate zone.
There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.
Who are the Britons?
Well, I didn't vote for you.
The same!
Oh!
A what?
Of course.
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
What word?
How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
I move for no man.
A scratch?  Your arm's off.
Stop that.
I'm invincible!
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?
Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
Well ... can we come up and have a look?
What is your name?
Who ... Who breaks out?
Who are you? TALL KNIGHT We are the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
What?
... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.
Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
... but a two-thirds majority ...
Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
Make a bridge out of her.
Exactly.  So... logically ...
Who approaches the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see.
What is your name?
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
At last!   A call!  A cry of distress ...  Concorde!  Brave, Concorde ... you shall not have died in vain!
Really, I feel fine, sir.
'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....
Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing.  All I had when I started was swamp ...  other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp.  So I built a another one ... that sank into the swamp.  I built another one ...  That fell over and THEN sank into the swamp ....  So I built another ... and that stayed up. ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island.
No ...  You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.
We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him entering the room.
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.
Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
Well ...
We are just not used to handsome knights ...  But you are wounded!
Camelot ...
Sir Galahad!
Well,  what seems to be the trouble?
Oh!
Stop saying the word!
They're all saying the word ...
He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ...
Brave Sir Robin ran away.
How much?
She loved him.
What?
And she sent no word down?
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
Be careful who sees it.
You should have someone look after you.
What's your name?
Checked and locked, sir.
I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.
Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
Checked and locked, sir.
Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
No.
She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
Then I envy yo.
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
For Her Majesty.
They don't see it.
Yes.  That will be company for you.
Mr Brown.
They're ready now.
We took a nip of whiskey.
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
Should we take it seriously?
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
We're going to lose.
Mrs Brown.
A fine choice, sir.
The Queen wishes to publish an account of him.
We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?
Excellent, ma'am, excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...
Why was I not informed?
Why not?
I have a letter, ma'am.
Ma'am?
Just tell me the fucking riddle.
Thanks, Albert.  Think you could print up those schematics?
Talk to me.
Sick?
What's her problem?
So where is he?
Hmmm.  He said you were going to have dinner?
No, in person.  Now.
What do you mean by "weird"?
It turned itself back on, Nick.
Sorry.  Maybe I need the Valium.
We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone...
Where do we go?
The Police, then...
SLIP-STREAM.
What Alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive.
You're not coming, Alex.
Our time's up.
We can take the dunes down like a ski slope. Pretend you're on a snowboard.
Go for it.
Then we'll go home?
Which way?
I love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you?
"Escape"?
So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies?
One of these cities, is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter, beware.
Adam, where are you?
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
I understand.
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
I guess I've come to quite a place.
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
I think so. I was just taking a shower.
Betty Elms?
Hi.
No, no, I'm fine.
You're still here?
Can you tell me what happened?
Was anyone hurt?
Well ... we'll leave her a note.
No...I need to sleep.
It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about?
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
No.... I don't...
Okay... but just...just to see.
"You're still here?"
Those men in front, in the car.
Betty Elms.
You're so easy.
Yeah, what for?
So, you came to see if he's out there?
Yeah, they showed me
Good morning. What do you have today ?
Why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
What are you doing ?
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
So why this ?
Why did you build this whole place ?
Do you have something better to talk about ?
And you believe that ?
What about you ?
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
Hey buddy, thanks for the help back there !
Is it over ?
The room has sound sensors. If you wake it up, it breathes fire.
An elevator ?
Don't.
Hand me the 3/8ths.
Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
Well ?
What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?
Yes, do you think he would like a raise and a new position ?
Hey, Mr. Executive. Buy you a drink sailor ?
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
How long till the drug wears off ?
Maybe you should get over fears.
Look he figured it out !
I don't know. Maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.
Was that the Old Man ?
Thank you very much.
So what's next ? No one's ever made it this far before.
I don't know. I think that a power grid just needs reset. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'll go down and reset it.
Just look at this tie. You could fry an egg off that orange, yow. Have you ever considered the Jerry Garcia line of ties ?
Come on, I'm serious. Look at Wilma. She's this frail little thing, and Fred, I mean Fred Flintstone is this BIG guy. He has to be hung like a horse, and THAT's why Wilma puts up with his B.S.
This is too easy, I mean I had a speech prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees to grovel.
Not now, Mom.
Hey... did we uhm, you know....
I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.
It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?
Sweet Jesus I never dreamed I'd be glad to see Central Park at night.
He was right behind me !
Good morning.
I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?
Umm, where do you want this?
My mother took this course with you at UCLA...&quot;The Foundations of Poetic Thought&quot;.
Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!
Well maybe you should join a hippie commune. But let me tell you something. Sooner or later it's gonna be your turn to take out the garbage.
Wow, you walked out with my mother?
Okay, no problem.
Ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. No, this talk isn't about sex, it's, well there've been a lot of changes, and I know you're upset about losing your room, but the baby's gotta go somewhere.
Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
Seriously.
So you're saying...What are you saying??
You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
We have a baby?
Well you should at least try a little bit.
I don't know if I want to.
Never heard of him. 
Reason? What reason?
I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up honey.
Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?
Thanks.
I'm glad you're here.
She's beautiful.
Would you like...eh...to have these movies?
I know that.
What's the matter?
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
So she had you in jail, in Russia?
Vada, he was giving you an easy out so you wouldn't have to write about your mother.
All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?
Hello.
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
Vada?
Vada what about you, who have you come up with?
Hey Vada. How's your report coming?
You're grounded 'till you're fifty!
You know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit.
Vada.
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude.
Come and get it.
Woah, watch it!
Uh oh...
Never heard of her.
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
Write me a poem?
Muh??
What's it for?
Okay, that does it, that does it, the strudel does it, first it's brakes then.... I mean I am not gonna let some Podiatrist with a Jaguar full of strudel come waltzing in here and....
She lives here too?
But...are you engaged or something?
Well then that's not exactly dating is it.
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
Do you think I should tell my dad about Jeffrey Pommeroy?
A secret, I like that.
I should do this myself.
Who knew that when I started working in the finest foreign car shop in LA, I would also find the light of my life.
Hi!
Wait, are you saying that I don't appreciate?
Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.
I think this place is just fine.
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when we open, we'll get you started.
Good morning.
Well I'm sort of involved.
Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.
Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
They're enormous, I know.
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.
What's this? December 8th, 1958?
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
Shelly?
Let me hold him.
Do you know him?
Arthur!!
Danny?
The boss is watching us...
God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
Harry, I really think she.....
After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.
You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
I just had a terrible thought Harry.
Dance with me?
Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
Yep, there they are... They always look the same every year...
Did you ahh, love him?
Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead.
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;
I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
It's for school, for summer writing class.
The money?
HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.
We're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer.
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
In the garage.
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
Who's that?
No.
Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life.
Do you like her?
He's allergic to everything.
Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.
No.
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
The boys at school don't think I am.
Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.
I won, I won!!!
My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?
It's okay sweetheart.
Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you really eat and sleep here?
Well, I guess you found my secret hiding place.
Hey look at this, no feet!
At what?
Maybe they had a big breakfast.
Your lip bleeding?
Hey look at this!
Heaven.
But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
Can we go yet?
THIS!! 
Woah!!
What do you want it for anyway?
Got it!
Jump in the water!!
Hi Vada.
California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.
No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.
Why are you running away?
I do, she's real funny.
You can come to my house for dinner?
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
Close your eyes.
Yeah, it's in the contract.
Nine years, we've seen each other through everything.  Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times.  The best times of my life, maybe.  Just drinking and talking.  Even over a phone.
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.
He was in love with me every day for nine years.  I can make him happier than she can.
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
Jesus.  You're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m...
I'll think about it.  I'm okay.
... luckiest guy in the Northern Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s...
It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...
How about...
And loving him means loving all of this.
It's not just clubs.  This guy always knows the best everything. The best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best Horowitz record, was he always like the...
But he always says...
Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.
In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...
When are you gonna come clean with your folks?
Well.  See.  That was a... reflex to see if it would...
I saw the show.
If he gives you grief, I'll have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds won't show.
I thought Michael was picking me up.
Well, the Sox are at home.  SI's letting me do a profile on the Big Hurt.  That's Frank...
Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.
Where was that, Florence, huh?
Should I whistle down a cab?
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
I guess you're right.  That would be deceitful... manipulative... controlling... emascula...
No problem.  A little bullshit about Daddy's "needs," and presto, I'm a lap dog in high society.
You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.
Will she like it?
This thing means that much to y...
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
This is her family and her fault.
I asked you...
Thank God you were here.
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
The Big Hurt, huh?
Jules, what's wrong...
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
Actually.  Lower.  I am the fungus that feeds on pond scum.  Lower. The layer of mucous that cruds up the fung...
You can't believe you've lost her!  Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love...
Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...
Fine.  I'm an insensitive, chauvinist asshole, and you're well rid of m...
He said you told him.  It'd be safer with you.
Well, don't lose it. Last time I gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.
You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now. December 9th, to be exact.
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
I don't want to listen to her sing -
Barnett?
Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.
You going today?
Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go.
I appreciate your concern, but she has to rest, so you can go on home.
You bet.
What?
Have you talked to Triplette?
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.
You want anything?  A drink?
Well, I'm here putting together a show. It's a benefit really.
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
Okay.
President?
Come on. He's a crook.
He got killed at a turkey shoot.
Haven's not going to talk to me.
HI. Look at those flowers. Did you grow those.
Yes, sir. I need a room
Uh huh.
You know anything about the stations here?
All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
What kind?
Nashville.
Well, I got to Nashville. That's pretty far.
I feel really good.
I don't know his first name.
I want to get the dog off my bed.
Bye.
When did you start singing?
Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
How old are you?
Thirty?
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
You know who that is?
That's for sure. At the airport - that's where it was. At the airport, there in one of those gift shops... Anyway, you better take a break.
Hello. John Triplette.
Wednesday at the park. We've got a lot of names coming in...
What for?
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
No  Hell, some secretary in New York just hands it to you. Only this one kept dropping it out of the box.
You go to school together?
I know a couple.
Peter Finch -- he's English.
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
Don't you think they'd just love another song instead?
Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research on that form of fighting, and I found out that Jeet Kune Do was a style developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know that?
Now, while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject, I have heard of Bruce Lee. And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of the, if not <u>the</u> greatest fighter in the history of martial arts.
Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?
I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's plan? Did you think it would work?
What did you think then?
You got something you want to do?
By all means, knock yourself out.
Say something.
Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate cream filled I asked for in your box.
Do you have a back up.
Not to anybody. She sings.
Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory.  What's up here?  What's in here?
Says the United States of America.
'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.
I can't go. I'm too fucked up.
How can you say that you 'admire' them?
Hypnotizing.
Through the power of the simple word---
That's the Mickey and Mallory way.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front.
Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your book. I'm impressed. Good work on Curtis Fox.
Yeah, we met. They're good men.
How's it working, Scotty?
Rollin'...and speed!
I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here.
Ya know, I was.
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
Since he and his wife have been in custody, they've killed---
Could we go with you and film it?
How 'bout that furniture plant?
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
Who're you tellin' to get, boy?! You watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!
'You Duff Anderson?
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.
I said: Cut it out!
I know.
How 'you doing?
Thanks.
Hard to get up in the morning, huh?
You working?
I'm a teacher.
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
Well, they seem just like everyone else.
But I would like to see you again.
At first it was real strange. Hell, Japan is a long ways from Alabama. Really got under my skin, though. Almost didn't come back.
I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
Goin' to see my kid.
Yeah. Well, I do.
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
That's right.
I'll have some coffee, please.
What d'you mean?
What happened, Duff?
What about that girl?
I can see why.
That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.
Hey, watch out! Guess you want a house full of pickaninnies too, huh?
What's wrong?
It sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. I seen hundreds of them - all my life.
Don't look so scared.
Ain't that something?!  That's just fine, baby.
Yeah. But just how're we goin' to make out? I got to get me a job.
Hi.
Don't do that!
Like hell they can't.  They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.
What you gettin' all pretty for?
What's so hot 'round town?
Just get her drunk.
See you, Duff.
What happened?
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
I asked you somethin', boy!
Want me to hold the light for you?
Most folks around here got no use for nigrahs. Got to understand them, that's all. How you doin', boy?
That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.
Come on, Pop.
Going back, huh?
They'll run you out.
Hello.
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
I'll be a monkey's kid sister! What d'you want to do a thing like that for?
He's your son.
Let me get you another glass of wine.
She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
You're hurt...
What are you doing in here?
Alright. Let's talk business.
Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
What are you talking about?
Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.
Did you trace it?
An odd selection, Mr Case.
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
She's ready to go.
Four men. Babylon soldiers.
I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?
What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
What?
That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
Wait... You hear that?
I had to limit your options.
I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.
Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
I gotta know... did it work>
Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
I'm going in.
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.
The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
You okay?
Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
How are you at riddles, Peter?
Never mind.  That is so awful that they hide your cars.
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.
Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?
Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?
It is?
Remember, that poet that we liked – the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets.
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.
Senorita Josie.
Wow. It's packed.
Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?
How many times have I fired her?
Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
A--flack jacket.
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
It's my dad. He worries.  Hi, Dad. I miss you too.
Yes, urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go.
Gus?
You having fun?
Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
What!?
It was a long time ago -
These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.
I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.
You're twenty-three years old!
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
That is so sad --
Are you having fun?
Good. Gibby gave me champagne.
Shock.
Yes.
Yes.
Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
Coming...
Why not?
But I have to go out. Something's happening out there.
Uh-huh.
<i>                      Just a box with bright colored paper And the whole thing topped with a bow.</i>
<i>                                     ... Birds of a feather.</i>
<i>                                          ... You're no fun.</i>
I told you I want that room unpacked.
Help me with this thing!
Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
You two got a thing going, or what?
You're wasting your time, the guy's a basket case.
The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.
Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?
You okay?
So, you feeling anything?
About not finding any bogey men?
What is it?
You want to talk about it?
You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!
I'm not taking drugs, Dad.  Can I go to bed now?
Yor dad picking the music again?
I'm sure you would.
I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.
What?
I've been good.  When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
When I was still a kid.  My folks got divorced.  After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.  I guess I didn't.
That was different.
Freddy?
Are you okay?
I don't know...
It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
But nightmares are the common thread?
Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
Must have opened while I was away at school.
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
I'm serious.
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
That's right.
Just until we get things under control.
To who?
You sound like Peter Pan.
Take it slowly.  Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.
Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.
I'm Taryn White.  I only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall.  Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through some very stange shit.
That's precisely what they need.  Some uninterrupted REM sleep to release all this negative energy.
In there.  Charlie Penny owns the place. We knew no one would ever find it.  I'm not even sure I can find it again.
We've got work to do.
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
Okay, Group's in session.  Straight talk only in this room.
I'm Will Stanton, and um...I've had a little accident, as you can see.
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
What do you think of the guinea fowl?
God, that's an enormous arse.
I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life.  Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you.
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
Floppy, huh?
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
Nothing.
So who left who?
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
I have thought about you.
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
You like Chagall?
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
Today has ben a good day.  Which under the circumstances is... unexpected.
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
This is certainly... ah...
But... wait... there are things to say.
Well... how have you been?
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
You were saying...
... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically.
What does it say?
Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film.
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
Does the girl have a name?
That's right.
Quickly, quickly -- talk very quickly what are you doing here with Anna Scott?
Yup.
Do you want to stay?
Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes.
But she said she wanted to go out with you?
Yes.  What do you think?
What happened?
Hi guys.  Oh holy fuck.
I agree.
'Horse and Hound.'  The name's William Whacker.  I think she might be expecting me.
Mr. Thacker?
Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the film?
Classic.  Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.
Cappuccino as ordered.
I suppose so.
Martin -- your customer.
'No comment' means 'yes.'
So I get the brownie?
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
Yes, sir.  I have him in my mind.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Does she know you're coming?
Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
Try 'Flintstone.'
I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?
Spike.
Yes.
I wouldn't go outside.
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
And yet you suspect her.
No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...
Yes, Mister Harding?
Yes, Billy?
What was it about her that disturbed you so, Billy?
Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!
My name is Miss Ratched. I'm the head nurse here. You've already met Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington and Warren.
All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time.
Is there anything else?
Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here.
That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if Mister McMurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may...
Oh, I had them removed.
Yes, Mister McMurphy.
You men remain seated!
Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
Mister McMurphy.
Yes, Miss Ratched?
Whatcha boys playin'?
What's your name, buddy?
So long suckers.
I-I-I-I-I'll g-g-g-go, M-M-Mack...
Say it again.
Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
Pssst! Hey Rose! There they are!
I'm leaving. Goodbye!
Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand!
Christ, they even got my first grade report card here...
Ya know what, Fred?
What's the use! Hooee! It'd do you birds some good just to get a little exercise lifting your arms to vote!
Twenty-five dollars.
He can't hear you!
Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!
Let me see your hand!
Why not?
Who told you that?
Hit me!
Yeah, an' I'm tellin' ya, she's just an icy-hearted over-the-hump gal who never got enough of the old wham-bam to straighten 'er out... Okay, who wants a card?
You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes.
Gimme the ball!
My turn.
Jesus God...
Is that so?
Well, I was turnin' this dilemma over in my head, when I happened to hit on that old tub room out there, an' I said to myself, McMurphy, I said, that place would make a great second day room. A sort of game room for the young fellas. Whadaya think, Doc?
How are you feeling?
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
Shhh. Hold it down! I'll take you guys down, but ya gotta come right back up! 'Kay?
Bullshit. You ain't got no way out!
Scanlon! Hey, Scanlon, wake up!
I thought I told you boys to go to bed!
What are they?
You comin' in to hold my hand?
Who is he?
That kind of behavior will get you a P.A. rating, my friend.
Hit me!
Make yourself at home, Mister McMurphy...
Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
Hey, Sam, bet ya two bucks ya lose.
Oh, there you are, Mister Turkle.
At this hour?
What are these men doing up wandering around?
Is he in an asylum?
Now, Miss. What do you want with twenty zombies when you got a twenty gun salute looking you right in the face.
No...  it's just very important that I find him, okay?
So, what's the story with your friend?
She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
There's this poem by Rilke, I don't remember the whole thing, but it's about that.  About waiting for that person, and wondering if you'll ever find them.  And the last line of it goes, "Who knows?  Perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--
But...  just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. You know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves.
What?...
I'm a liberal!
...has a prior commitment.
Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live here?  Like, what if he's a cannibal in New Guinea or something?
We'll KNOW.
It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it?  I knew that was too much.
Smoking or non-smoking?
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
Hello?  Is anybody there?
Are you okay?  You want some help?
Why can't you just tell me?
To the foot doctor.
There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?...  Just tell me what it is, I'll say it.  I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
Fine.  Okay.  Forget me.  Leave me out of it.  But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.
I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel.  So, I called there, they said he left yesterday.  But, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route.  He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano.  I called.  And they told me he's checked in.
I'd really rather not say.
Hi, Peter.
And she's a knock-out, too.
Hey--
You were saying...
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
I'd call that a yes.  Do I get a hint?
Very funny.
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...
Been here long?
I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?
Wait.
Sure.
Is everything okay?
But somebody wrote those songs.
No.
But one day you wake up and realize you've been had.  Of course life isn't like the movies.  That's why there are movies.
It's a miracle.
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
Thank you so much.
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
What are you doing?
You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
I just got a dial tone--
A phone message.  Only--
Your brother?
So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
He's heeeeeerrre...
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Hi-iii...
Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be.  I've got forty-eight hours.  I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.
Whatareyoudoing?!
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
And he is living proof.
Kate, you're still there?  I thought you'd be on your way home by now.
It was an emergency.  I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her.  I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
You got a real friend here, kid. Don't forget it.
Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
You said they was only going to talk to him.
You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.
Mm—hmm.
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
What the hell!!!
It wasn't him!  It was you, Charley. You and Johnny. Like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says, "Kid, this ain't your night— we're going for the price on Wilson." It ain't my night. I'd of taken Wilson apart that night! I was ready— remember the early rounds throwing them combinations. So what happens— This bum Wilson he gets the title shot— outdoors in the ballpark! – and what do I get— a couple of bucks and a one-way ticket to Palookaville.  It was you, Charley. You was my brother. You should of looked out for me. Instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money.
See! You don't understand!
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me— who?  -- who?
Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too— don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
What happened?  What happened?
Boy, they sure fly nice, don't they?
I changed my mind. I feel real mean tonight.
I go for this stuff. You know this city's full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of 'em. They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park.
Likewise. And draw two for chasers.  Now you're beginning to live.
What made you want to be a fighter?
Like Joey? Are you afraid to mention his name?
You're not sore at me?
What are you crying for?
Edie, listen, stay out of this mess. Quit tryin' to ask things about Joey. It ain't safe for you.
Because... because...  Listen Edie, don't get sore now— but I think we're getting in love with each other.
What are you going to do?
Edie!
Pigeons... .
Edie... Edie... ..
I've been sittin' in the church.
Terry— what's happening to you?
You... .
Edie...
Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.
Thanks just the same.
But I feel like— My friends won't talk to me.
Jimmy...
My pigeons... .
Who is he! Edie, you're so softhearted and soft-headed you wouldn't recognize the devil if he had you by the throat. You know who this Terry Malloy is? The kid brother of Charlie the Gent, Johnny Friendly's right hand, a butcher in a camel hair coat.
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
Pop, don't think I'm not feeling grateful for all you've done to get me an education and shelter me from this.  But now my eyes are open. I see things I know are so wrong how can I go back and keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people aren't living? I'm staying, Pop. And I'm going to keep on trying to find out who's guilty for Joey. I'd walk home with a dozen Terry Malloys if I thought they could help me. I tell you I'm staying, Pop. Pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers.
Where you goin'?
About Edie?
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
I want to see you, Terry.
Your gun.
What did you say?
Take your hands off me. What you call me?
You can!
D 'n D?
Where you going? I'll walk along with you.
Condolences. How you fixed for cabbage this mornin'?
Some chance at ten percent a week! And if he don't borrow, he don't work.
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
I wonder how long she's goin' to hang around, huh, Terry?
Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?
—Do you?
You come from Green Point? Go back to Green Point. You don't work here no more.  Here, kid, here's half a bill. Go get your load on.
He don't, huh?  Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
You want to know the trouble with you? You think it makes you a big man if you can give the answers.
Go on— beat it. Don't push your luck.
You want to know something? Take the heater away and you're nothin'— take the good goods away, and the kickback and the shakedown cabbage away and the pistoleros—  —away and you're a great big hunk of nothing—  Your guts is all in your wallet and your trigger finger!
You got some nerve.
Tippi-tippi-tim, tippi-tim, Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan...  Gotta dime for a crippled-up docker?
A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.
You don't think he'd be— helpful?
Leave her alone, you fiend!
We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.  Let's turn back.
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.
I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
I've got the ropes loose now. I've got my hands free.  Be careful--Don't change your expression too much.  They must not catch on.
I love you Bob. I really do. Forgive me?
You love me then?
...And what is this?
She pleases me.  Permit her to live in the World of the Snakes. 
When!?
Your pleasures of course!
We don't know of anything, Master...
He wants us.
That's funny, Adele.  How many more times you gonna gimme that one?
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
I want to speak with you, please.
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
I'm getting ready to go out.  You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?
Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught.  I'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself.
That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.  I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.
You were his what, his box?
I bet that's all the hacks they send out.  Otherwise nobody's left to mind the store.
Where in the hell are we?
Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?
You're just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you.
I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
Just that she got away.
Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better chance there is either Glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.
What?!
You at least bring the gun?
Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.
Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?
You tell your sister about it?
No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.
Yeah?  You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us?
Listen, I gotta get some better shoes, few other things before tomorrow.  Why don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen, we'll hook up later?
Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth.
You know they gonna set us up.
Come <i>on</i>.
No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars.
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
I have to qualify, is that it?
All right, but...
That's all I wanted to know.
You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man.
Yeah, why?
Put it down or I'll shoot.
You can live or die, it's up to you.
Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together.  You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
How much for your company at chow?
This doesn't concern you, Foley.  Why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke?
Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. He's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system.
Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.
Reggie, push off and hit, man.  Push him off.
Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor.
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor.
You don't seem all that scared.
That part in the movie where they get shot?  Warren Beatty and... I can't think of her name.
And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
I mean, romantically.
None of your business.
That's my dad.
How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
Think I could have them back?
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
You like taking risks.
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.
You coming back?
You're not dumb.
Come on, Jack -- don't.
If you don't, one of those guys will.
Take your sunglasses off.
Sounds high, doesn't it?
You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off.
Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?
Really?
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you in here?
You goin' right back to work?
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
But you're sure we've met, huh?
Do we have a gun in the car?
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.
Take the next exit.
Glenn, take the exit.
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
I wanna talk to you about a job.
What'd you fight, middleweight?
What's wrong with you?
Moselle Miller?
Here?  In this house?
Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
Got run over by a car.
I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.
It's beautiful.
Can we change the subject?
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.
Dad...
You were talking in your sleep.
"Hey, yourself."
Hello?  Yeah, she is.  Just a minute.  For you.
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
He waved to you?
How do I look, mama?
A'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right...  Okay, on three:  One... Two...
Yeah, someone spotted two of 'em in this hobo camp out by the airport, called the number--
Did you pay the guy the reward?
We have a problem here?
I found a rubber.
Are you sure they're here?
I wish she could forget him.
Nervous?
You're Walker, right?
That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
They ready, Earl?
How could you do this?
I understand how it could happen.  I know why any guy would love her.  And I can't blame you that it happened.  You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
Don't blame her, Rafe.  It's not like you're thinking.
What about easier to hit in an air raid?
Yeah.
That might not have been such a good idea.  They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield.  The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
Don't get smart with me, son.
Is that the good new, Sir, or --
How'd you get this?
You take care, Dorie.
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable.  What I feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that.  If I don't come back, I don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life.
Leapin' Jesus!
If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody States!
So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.
Quite a bit more rain than usual this year. I hope it doesn't spoil the rhubarb.
I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.
Do you have to wear that hat?
Welcome to the singles scene.
What's the matter?
Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!
And we're here on the couch...
You got a Tab?
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
What're you doing here?
Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better.  Could you give me a ride to school?
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
Forget it, it'll never work.
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
Peggy! Where're you going? Come back!
Come back to me.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
Yes, sir.
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
Don't get your hopes up.
The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
Coffee and a donut.
This is great reefer.
Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more Jell—O for me, Mom.'
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
You think so?
Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor.
If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
Hi, Dad.
I closed my Christmas club.
That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them.
Oh no!
I have a note.
You're looking pretty chipper this morning.
Sort of.
Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
Where have you been?
Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards.
I remember that dress.
Dancing with you.
I have to talk to you. It's very important.
What a great kite.
And then, there's Richard's Burrito.
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
Okay. I promise.
You're giving me the creeps.
You're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. Maybe you've just got powers of precognition. Well, maybe you're just out of whack.
All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful?
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
Hi, Richard.
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
Like what?
What do you know about hypnosis?
No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad.  Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it.
What's the matter?
Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys.
I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.
You ever think about running away?
I know, Mom.
If MacroSystems wins, an energetic, young company will be destroyed, five thousand Americans will be out of work. Moreover, the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit Macrosystems is trying to pull.
This time. What about next time?
Perhaps... you're right. I've certainly been busy. With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time...
Excuse me, Charles. With all due respect... this is... preposterous! It doesn't make any sense, it sounds as if we're talking about someone else. Pardon the lack of humility, but I've had the distinct impression I was kind of... one of the rising stars around here. And I feel that wasn't just my imagination. And I also think I deserve to know what's really going on here, Charles.
That's the third time. I better call the office.  Would you relax, please?
We're not skipping this treatment.
What's wrong with you?
I'm not going to close the--
Maybe I should start making plans, is that what you think? Start planning my memorial service? "Begin to prepare for the inevitable."
I'm not going to die.
I know that, Charles.
I'm trying to help your "partner." You're not a member of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the ER.
New baby?
Correct. I'm seeking representation.
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
Hell, they are staring. What's that shit on your face?
Big trouble.
Okay... They want you out. It's against the law to fire you for having AIDS, so they make you look like a fuck up. Which leads us to the mysterious, lost file.
Oh, Beckett. How's it goin'?
Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive...
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
We proceed, representing your estate.
In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?
What kind of movies do they show there?
Some do. I didn't.
Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler?
Ms. Burton. You're black.
Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt they were too... "ethnic" is the word she used. She said he would like it if I wore something smaller, less garish, and... more "American."
Leave that.
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition. Is that correct?
Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
Explain to me, if you can, Mr. Wheeler, explain this to me like I'm a ten year-old. This trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying? <u>Not</u> about your understandable, if unfounded, fear of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it? You're saying, this trial is about Andrew Beckett's character. Am I getting this right?
You load the film... ? No, on this side... or this side? Don't move the baby!
Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That beautiful, sensuous woman is a... <u>lesbian</u>?
Since when?
Yeah. Do I have a case?
Whoa, whoa...  What do you expect them to say, you're Alan Dershowitz?
Not when I was in the Navy.
Going on... like...?
This would be a good time to break for the day...
Andrew brought AIDS into our offices, into our men's room. He brought AIDS to our annual goddamn family picnic.
Wait a minute. The man was fired for incompetence, not because he has AIDS. You didn't know he was sick, did you, Bob?
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
Gonna lose everybody out here....
You came for us....
What whispers?
You did this? To yourself?
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually --
But I just wanted to say --
Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?
Riddick? What the hell are you --
Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.
Back to the ship, huh?
We're just here to carry your light, aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.
What, you're afraid?
<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
They're already dead. Get on board.
You barely know them.
I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at night.
S'matter?
Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even more.
You said we were going to trust him now. You said there was a deal.
Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.
Dancin' on razor blades here...
Oh, lady. If you're in your right mind, I pray you go insane.
How much you weigh, Johns?
Hey, <u>you're</u> the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An' now you 'spect me to go back like a <u>whipped</u> dog?
This does not help us, Johns.
Why did I fall on you?
You mean that "load" of passengers?
I don't suppose....
So quiet. You get used to the sounds of the ship, then....
You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
One is all?
I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't a natural die-off.
New Mecca....
She's the captain, we should listen to --
...then we saw this.
King Tut's tomb....
Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
You'd cut me loose, Boss?
Well, what's it look like now?
Such as.
<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv.
What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
How did you know we'd come here?
I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
If there's any shooting, Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to die. Depend on it.
Do you have to work tonight?
Look -- she remembers.
The blood transfusion.
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
Flight is a scientific impossibility.
'Then how do you account for me?,
You didn't think so then.
How did it go?
We'd better get started. If the mounted police pick up our trail, they'll come this far at least.
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.
Will he live?
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
Did you see that? It's remarkable!
Well? Where are we? Have any notion, skipper?
Landon! Join the expedition.
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
No cigar.
Not everything. They left a hostage.  How do you feel, Lucius?
Lucius.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
What is that?
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
Sustained.
No.
You lied. Where is your tribe?
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.
Twelve hundred years ago.
We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me?
What is this?
Listen-
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
Taylor! Tell him.
Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?
I SHIT on all o' you.
Where the fuck is red platoon! Tell 'em to get their asses up here! What the fuck you doin' back here Elias? Round up your assholes and move 'em up front, we're getting chopped to shit.
We got boo-coo movement. 3rd Battalion just got hit 15 kliks north of here. 
Hey Big Harold, gimme your peaches for the fruitcake man.
Come on you can do better than that!
Does he have a metal plate in his head?
Baaa, got no time to go to the movies. Love and Hate too busy fighting for possession of my soul.
Hey Taylor, you okay man?
Barnes got it in for you, don't he?
You okay man? Neck botherin' you?
Tell Six we need engineers here, this pos. is crawling with traps.
What are you talking about! 
Not the only man to meet his Jezebel either.
Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
You don't want to hear about it?
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.
Or Reno?  They always throw them off the bridge there, I've heard.
A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
No thanks?
Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you?
Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
I think you're drunk.
Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.
You can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. I'm only killing time.
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
Would it make you anymore amusing?
Dance?
You said it wasn't a tragedy.
They'll know whether he killed himself.
Certainly not to me.
Cold?
Want to dance?
Us?
It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
You'll be safe here.  I won't be long.  Help yourself to anything you want. The galley's through there.  You can make coffee if you like.
It did, but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.
Killaine's wise.  We can't wait any longer.  Here, put this on.  But stay out of sight until we clear the harbor.  I'll tell you when. 
See anything?
I thought you had to be back to the hotel.  To leave my--my note.
Not this one.  And not Mitchell.
Mine?
I think you mean that.
Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
You won't tell me who you are? You won't even give me a chance to help you?
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
This isn't a very good place to talk.
I'm about to be very silly.  A man passes a girl on the street--a very lovely girl--his eyes meet her eyes, and something reaches out and takes hold of his heart-- and then she goes on and is lost in the crowd--and he says to himself, "There goes my lost love"-- and it's true--if he never sees her again, it's still true.  Of course, after a while, he forgets-- or almost forgets--because after a while we forget almost everything.  But this man is a copper.  He gets orders--routine orders--to go to a place and investigate a murder-- and everything points to a certain girl.
He could have killed me a dozen times.  You'd never have known.
I'd like a few words with you, in private.
Nice friendly approach you've got. Goble. I could hardly walk when I got out of bed this morning.
Private eye?
Who told you my name?
Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you?
Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
I have a warrant for her arrest.
It could have been an accident.
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
And old man Clarendon?  He had a motive, too.  Margo and her money.
Mitchell was too drunk.
Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.
You forgetting the gag line, Killaine.  The police don't take anything for granted.
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
And don't get too logical, Driscoll. In police business it doesn't work. I wish it did.  But it doesn't
Got a moment, Inspector?
The Super's just given me the sweetest dressing down I've ever had.  I'm still reeling from it. And believe me, I had it coming. I apologize.  What you think is important--I think is important.
What's the face for, Driscoll?
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
You in charge here?
... I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector.
You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder.  What are you going to do about it?
You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
This is the shell.  What about the gun?
I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
May you what?
I never saw it before.
Remember that time, didn't I? Good morning Mrs. West.  Does your visit here mean you've changed your mind?
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
Ye have, have ye?
There are people in this world who don't think a police badge is a badge of honor.  I'm not one of them.
Get out of here!
I'm afraid you're not very glad to see me, Margo.
I hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. I wasn't lucky.
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
How long have you had it?
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
Right.
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
You're kind to be so encouraging.
I do worry about Susan.  Have you known her long?  She hasn't mentioned you.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
It's terribly good.
I know, I know!  Gentlemen, let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to The Cold War.  James Penfield.  He wrote the opening chapter, on 'The Berlin Airlift'.  One of the best chapters in the book.
I'll have some of that.
And you'll join me in a sambucca?
It's everything we wanted.  A very good read.  A terrific piece of work.  So, here's to you and Suez.
Was that your chapter, then?  It was very good.
Good theory.  But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does.
Mummy and I, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters.  Then a couple of years after Daddy died, and not long after I left Oxford, she started seeing various men and I was furious.  I really was upset. I stopped going home.  I never phoned.  I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  Then I got a job I was interested in, and I started to see lots of men, and I suppose I grew up a little and began to understand.  So I wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry I was, and how I was worried that we were drifting apart.  And do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.
I called you a taxi.
Did she talk about me?
I haven't seen much of you.
Jeremy phoned this morning
He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.
Shall we have a drink or something?
To the Fleet.
Uh-huh.  Tell me what you think of this first.
Get way.  You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying--
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained.
Perhaps I will, then.
Susan and I are very old friends, James.
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
Hello.
Thanks.
Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.  The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work.
Jeremy!  How Fantastic.
Something happened.  You got nuked in the last quarter.
Friends of yours, huh?
The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
We gonna jump or jerk off?
Utah, you copy bruddah?
You gonna pull?
You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.
Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?
You never were...
You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.
Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?
Surf conditions okay?
A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case for two years.
Smart.  You burn time in the vault.
Sorry.
Yeah.  What's your theory?
... Four months.  June to October. Mmmm...same the year before.
They're like some kind of tribe. Got their own language.  You can't just walk up to these guys.  You've got to get out there.  Learn some moves.  Get into their head.  Pick up the speech.
What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
Big zippo so far.  How about you?
Did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up?
Bodhi, yeah.  I'm on him all day, right.  He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House...  ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.
I know where they're going.
What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?
I came out here from Ohio a month ago.  Never saw the ocean before.  I didn't think it would effect me so much.  Like I'm drawn to it, or something.  I want to do what you do.  It's the truth.
Who's the girl?
Look at you.
So what'd the other guy look like?
I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--
Major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas. Looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper.  Then a different set of track, over there.
You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?
That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful.
Billy's on it.  Heat seeker. Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.
I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for this, Dillon?
She's too valuable. She's got to know their whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us.
We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
I can accept that, it comes with the job.
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
Any sign of the hostages?
You lift off in three hours.  There's one other thing.
Mmmnnn...?
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
I like your hat.
The real estate possibilities are endless.  Most of the yard we'll just level.  I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said --
No.  What I have is a lot of money.
I... I don't know.  There... there wasn't time...
You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?
That's ridiculous.
Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
What's your name, lover.
Better believe it.
My raincoat's in the back.  Put it on.
Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
It's a very good year.
What do you like?
Did you sleep well?
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
Do you ever... enjoy it?
So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
Four thousand.
Three.
Just one?  Christ... I hope it's appropriate.
Why not?
Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
Vivian... I'm sorry.  I wasn't prepared for questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did.  I should have known that it would hurt you.
To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
I've never treated you like a whore.
What did you do to him?
Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia.  I'll see you in the office.  By the way, about your car...
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds.  Now, you're giving him the chance to get away?  As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --
No, let's go to work.  Okay?
Kit...
What kind of school?
I'm just going to my room.
What's your name?
I got a dress.
What is it, Miss Vivian?
It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.
Actually, some of the richest people I know have the worst manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.  All right now, pay attention please.  Salad fork.
Then you use your <u>soup spoon</u>.
Then you would use your--
Barnard Thomas here.  Miss Vivian, I wonder if you might come down to the front desk.  There's someone here to see you.
Are you looking for something in particular?
You have beautiful things.  How much is this?
Yes?
Get out!
Brides often are, I'm told.
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
Singed a bit, were you?
Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, "All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." Three years he said that. "Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened.
We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.
Oh, Westley, darling.  Westley, why won't you hold me?
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.
I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
I only dog paddle.
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
Probably he means no harm.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
Inigo.
It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.
Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.
They're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part?
You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
Westley's only faking, right?
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
-- and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.
There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. They were both masters.
Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.
I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.  You returned this Westley to his ship?
Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find.  Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight.
Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? --
And it is guarded by sixty men.
Look, I'm retired. And besides, why would you want someone the King's stinking son fired? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.
Sir. Sir.
We're really in a terrible rush.
Thank you for everything.
We'll wait until you're ready.
Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
I admit it -- you are better than I am.
You're just stalling now.
Then make your choice.
"True love." He said, "true love," Max. My God --
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
Your grandfather's here.
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is Boomerang.
"By the light, by the light,
"He's gonna croon love's tune,
You mean ooops, don't you?  Say ooops and get out.
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
What was I saying?
Oh, you'd go to jail.  If the play were a hit, you'd have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
What scheme?
Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.
I'm not going to jump on you!
What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you?
Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal.
What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
What are you doing?
What is she gonna do here?
Maybe it's not true!
I never should have listened to you.
Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.
Don't help me.
Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...
Vaaaat???
But he has long hair!
Not.
Plus to minus.  Negative to positive. Male to...
Do it!  Do it!
Do you need us?
Finder's keepers.
Feeling better?
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench.
Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.
Like clockwork.
By the sacred memory...
Nietzche...
Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.
Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know that, you been up?
We are falling back on all fronts. Our soldiers are retreating.
Who can we attack?  They're all too big.
He's the only cat left that still grooves me.
What did you tell the people?
I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
You out to buy a motel?
I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?
It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess.
Very early. Dawn.
No.
I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing.
What's your interest?
That's the one I'd've picked for you myself!
No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.
It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
Yes, Mr. Lowery.
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
Yes?
What should I know?
Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
What thing could we be in together?
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
Our Deputy sleeps.
I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.
Where'd you go to college?
I wonder so many things about her now.  Why she never told me about you...  Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
Sorry.
What?
I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...
The only girlish thing you have lost.
I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.
And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
Mary, whenever it's possible, tax- deductible or not, I want to see deductible you. And under any conditions.  Even respectability.
How can you even think a thing like that!
Your home address. Oh, just the town will do.
You're very... kind.
It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.
I imagine so.
You go out... with friends?
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast.  What time will you...
Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.
I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy.
Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!
Was that all?
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
Just before she died she came to--
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
So--friendly or otherwise--?
No, I wouldn't be surprised at anything from you. Winningly. MAXWELL Now, honey--you are here in time to help me and you can--
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh 
I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
What's down there?
Dr. Meirschultz, please.
The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.
You lie!
Did you? Where?
All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
There's no hurry. It's early.
If you're going to be indiscreet, I wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. Rich men, like Winton, love you and leave you.
Why, certainly, sir. My fiancée. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.
But why? She's the best friend I've got.
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
I won't let you say that!
She thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
That's the way I feel about it.
Oh! Mr. Igor! -- I'm so glad you're here -- I don't know why I should be, but I was a little bit afraid.
Please, oh, please, I haven't done anything to hurt you.
Listen, copper, get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant.
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
As I live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince.
Why the goose pimples? If he wasn't social register -- if it was somebody like me, you'd be trying to hang him.
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
Which one is me? The horse?
Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
I am right! I know I'm right!
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
Just this -- I got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they haven't got a wax figure of Joan Gale in that line-up, then I'm crazy.
What do you mean?
No kiddin'?
I don't remember. Not so very far--
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
Don't give this to anybody else, will you?
What do you mean police dog?
Listen, kid. You're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --
That's what I said.
You weren't going with her?
Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.
Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.
How much money have you got?
I will only be gone about half an hour.
I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow.
Yep. Everything settled.
Well, any time I can do anything for you --
Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?
Two: what if I didn't miss?
Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
Why am I doing this?
We flopped the first time out.
Of what?
No.  I didn't.   I'm listening.
I didn't want to leave things the way we did.  Not this time.
Why?
They're filthy, Mother.
I know, Mother.
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
Who would want to do such a thing as that?
Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
No. No, you're not hurting me.  But I think you better quit it.
Did your Momma really give you castor oil?
You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.
I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?
What do you think, Brother?
See that, son? Now this is a heel, see, and there, that's the ball of a foot. Someone has been walking here.
All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room. Where is the girl?
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
Children, children! Be quiet, all of you!  The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?
Heh, what a hypocrite.
It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.
There goes Mother.
I can't see. What are they doing, what's happening?
This is my place and you can't have it.
He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out!
Now I can't see. What are they doing?
Wow! Brrrother!
It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
Well, if she's got any sense at all, she'll listen to that.
About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
How could that be, son?
What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...  Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?
All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
Well, you have knocked me for a hell of a loop, old man. A hell of a loop.
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
That's a hell of a thing to say. Why, Rose?
I am ahead of you.
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do.
Lay off of that stuff, son. It upsets your mother.
They'll put her in jail. The damn little fool might as well be naked.
Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road.
I wish you wouldn't pick on Rose and tease her like that. Of course her clothes are silly, but she's ignorant, naive, she doesn't know any better.
He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
I am not being brutal to her!
I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
She hasn't actually done anything...
Honey!
I thought I knew you. I thought I knew you better, I thought in your heart you were a good and kind man. Well, I can't believe what I've just heard in this room. A defenseless girl depending on you for protection, and you propose to mutilate and destroy her. How could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man?
Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
You don't know where you're going?
Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it.
There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!
What baby? What baby? What baby are you speaking about?
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
Well, we know you were there. The bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous.
Um-m, well...
I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?
What's the matter with him?
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth.
Yes, and it's very bad. It probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia.
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
Rose has learned her lesson, haven't you, Rose?
I was going to tell him.
Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
What do you want?  I'm clean.  I been clean a long time.
Oh, you fuckers!  You fucking fuckers!  What?  What do you want?
Hey now... what the fuck... ?
Know what he's doing, Benny?  He's trying to jog your memory.
It's bone dry out there.  Everybody's hurting.  The stuff floating around's been cut so many times it's like powdered sugar, but Zimnermann's gonna fix it.
Just a little, you know... Bicentennial memento.  Nothing special.
Sons of bitches!
I can work this.
What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?
Ah, jeez, Billy... careful!
How you doing back there?
Happy Independence Day.
Who said it wa's me, hub?  Anyway... he fell off a ladder.  It wasn't really my fault.
You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it?
Maybe.
And, what... what am I forgetting? Oh, yes... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house!
Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
You know what I mean.
We got him.
Get closer!  Don't lose him!
You put your bumper just behind his left tire and then accelerate... make him spin out...
I can't believe I'm hearing this,
Yeah, my arms healed up real good, and that's how I wanna keep 'em. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
Come again... ?
Get his attention.
Hey-Ho... !  Maybe we're not alone in this thing after all.
You're... you're not doing what I think you're doing... ?
Oh, yeah... the explosion.
Where's your pet gorilla and the female Uncle Tom?
Yeah?  So, what do you want to ask today that I can't answer?  I'm a busy man.
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.
I can't do it, Ben.
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
What is thy bidding, my Master?
They are clear, my Master.
Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
Han!
Luke.
I thought she was with you.
Someone who loves you.
I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
I...
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
What did he say?
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
All wings report in.
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
What do you remember?
Tell me.
I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
If that is your destiny.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
Yes or no will do.
Do you have any tattoos Brad.
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
Janet.
Yes.
Oh Brad, I'm mad.
Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.
I'm coming with you.
Oh....Say something.
Well I want to leave.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.
Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling - what if...
Maybe we could try it this way.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
Good God.
Great Heavens, that's a laser.
You did right.
You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?
Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
Feeling
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
I think you had better both come inside.
The Master is not yet married.  Nor do I think he ever will be.  We are simply his servants.
I smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get... What?
Looks quiet, y'know.
Would ya like a glass of water?
You sure?
Why?
What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?
Would ya take off your glasses?
...What?
I always knew you was pretty.
Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me?
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
...And he called the reporters --
I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.
...I dunno.
You busted?!
I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty.
Shape, nothin' -- They're afraid. They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!!
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
This a con?
...How 'bout for the Cokes?
Apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations. Balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on Creed's temple -- not much movement from Balboa, duck a left, a right, another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple -- I mean explodes. The Champ backs off.
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
Don't hit the face! Not the face!!
That's it? -- Completely?
Yo Rock. Did I give you a job this mornin? How come ya didn't break this guy's thumb like I asked ya? When ya don't do what ya are told, it makes me look bad, kid.
How'd you know?
Listen, kid, I'm with ya. Ya know, I'm with ya -- Italian, we're blood. You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at. Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side.
Excuse me.
Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato.
How old are ya?
How old?
More like thirty.
Hey, ever think about retirin'?
Here's the card?
...What?
Respect, I always dished ya respect.
Please, kid.
Don't you care what the people will say?
Can't hardly tell. Don't swallow the blood -- Go for his ribs. Don't let 'im breathe.
Hey, Rock -- What happened?
Yo, Paulie.
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
Hey --
The girl's dryin' up! She's gotta live a little before her body dries up!! You're a pal, Rock -- How 'bout yo' talk to her? Y'know, it's Thanksgivin' tomorrow.
Ya sister knows I'm comin'?
It don't bother me none.
Yo, Rock. I made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man -- Thatta dog?
...I can't haul meat no more.
Do you feel you have a chance?
How will you fight Apollo Creed?
And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.
So, makin' dame jokes, huh, Eddie? Well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.
So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?
I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.
I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
Come on, Doom.  What would a company like that want with Toontown?
Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.
A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
You?
Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
I didn't know who I could trust.
Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
I got him on loan from Disney.
You got the will in there, don't ya?
You tricked me, damn you!
What the hell are you doin'?
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
Does this help?
You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious.  What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
Two bits.
What the hell are you doin' in there?
By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
No better?
Live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow.
Keep away the cats! Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says, &quot;God send me no need of thee.&quot; and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
Either withdraw unto some private place, or reason coldly of your grievences, or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
Is the day so young?
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
Out--
By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves; Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.
'Tis he.
God pardon sin, was thou with Rosaline!?
That's my good son: but where hast thou been
How well my comfort is revived by this.
As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.
O God. Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? O serpent heart hid with a flowering face. Was ever book containing such vile matter's so fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace.
Goodnight.
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
I have.
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
He jests at scars that never felt a wound. But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief, That thou her maid art far more fair than she: Be not her maid, since she is envious; Her vestal livery is but sick and green And none but fools do wear it; oh cast it off. It is my lady, O, it is my love! O, that she knew she were!
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. Nurse, Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less.
Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah!
And so did I.
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
Meaning, to court'sy.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
Follow me close. Gentlemen, gooday. A word with one of you?
Calm, Dishonorable, Vile Submission! Thou art my souls hate! Tybalt! You ratcatcher, will you walk?
I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry from the States.
Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?
What in bloody hell is going on?
You better be careful, Seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix.
Do I need to repeat myself?
I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -  Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed.  Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of it."  "Have the girl fuck him."  But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less.
I bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using, it was in his contract.  Cost a nice penny, too, especially that goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive tastes.
Yes, Gregor, they sent me.
Where's my information?
Sit, sit...  Would you like one?
We'll die if we stay here!
If you're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains all over this car.
Bullshit!
Then where is it?
Sent it where?
Gregor, is that you?
I would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the American.
A means to an end, is that it?
Nobody's going to do that!
Are you sure you won't have a drink?
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
What're you talking about, man?  I don't understand.
I ride with fat-boy...
Where is this broad?
I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy.
Where to?
That was a nice move you did on our young friend.  Judo?
What's the difference?
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is.
They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
You know, what you pulled back there, that was bullshit.
You don't.  You just learn to live with it.
That makes twice now you've saved my life.
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.
It is at that.
Give me a cigarette.
In a minute.
Do we need anything else?
Not here.  They might see it.
Time to quit.
The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.
That's a good question.
And now...
You son-of-a-bitch...
I know.
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
Why didn't you kill her?
My man, how you doing?
I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.
Can you get it?
I'd like to know what they were doing in my town!  Did you get ID off any of them?
Don't spend it all in one place.
Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher.  He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars!  Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that?  His excuse was the government got it all.
Ten thousand right here.
We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus!
All right hold on!  Lemme think...  Shit, did you touch the car?
I do.  It's little shit like that sends people to jail! We have to cover all the bases if we're going to pull this!
We'll torch the bases, how's that?
We're going to be patient. If we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions.
Shhh!
I don't know...
It's the right thing to do.
And how do you figure we do that?
Look, Earl.  We gotta go straight. This is all messed up...
Not bad enough to kill him.
Maybe we should say somethin'.
We've got to go now, then.
Oh Jesus...
We got to get out of here.  Do you understand?  We got to get out of here right now!
You're the one who's nuts! There's no one left to touch us, Booth.  We're home free!  We just plant a little of the money on Dwayne, and it's all ours.
That'll bring me down, too. Eventually.  You gotta know that.
Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The tape was a basic Maxell D-80.  You can buy 'em at any store.  There's no way they can pin anything on me.
There's going to have to be a change in our arrangement.
You don't expect us to believe that do you?
Come on, Booth.  Don't let him do this!!!
Well, we have one lead and that's what I'm looking into next.
Yeah.
Nothing's wrong.
OK.
OK.  I love you.
You got me something?  What's the occasion?
What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...
You're worth every last penny.
Let's just get out of here, get out of this -- place.  We'll drop out, get a house have some kids, get a satellite dish...
What is this?  Don't be stupid man...
Well we'd like to help you in any way we can.  We're all in this together, as law enforcement officers.
Uh, no...
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Sheriff Hogan --
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.
Yeah.
Anything I can help you with?
Yeah, she is.  She comes up to about here on me.
I don't suppose you've seen her.
Let's see...do you know her cup size?
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
It was going to be a surprise!
What are you saying?
I'm not asking.
You want to see how more unglued I can get?  Try me.
Is that the mail?
Well what do you know!  An air conditioner.
That's great Earl!
Don't you want it?
We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.
It's nine-thirty in the morning.
I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it.  Do you know why?
No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
Invitation, please.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.
Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.
Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
Of course not.  My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight.  Big party.
That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?
I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in.
No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.
That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
I have plenty of dates.
You.
Not Yu.  You!
You're not very good at this, are you?
No, no, that would be crazy --
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
It sounds impossible --
Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.
Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?
The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
Wait!  There's people down there!
Get it out of here!
Let me see it again?
They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.
I think we should stop talking.
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
Steamed dumplings?
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
We're slowing down.  This must be it.
What is Mac out?
Lee!
Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?
You go after Ricky.  I got this.
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
First class.
Is this a payoff?
Are you okay?
I didn't know which side you were on.
Lee, I've missed you, brother.  I heard about the two Americans, I'm so sorry, you must be under great pressure.
... if your father were alive, I would be turning to him now.  I didn't blow up the American Embassy, but I believe some of my people did.  My enemies are trying to frame me.  There is a war going on within the Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My name has been written into the book of death.
Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation.
Who the hell is that?
You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
He'll be OK. Russ is a tough son of a bitch.
Beach Boy.
You speak English!
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
It's the same thing!
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.
I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years.  He wanted me to come with them to America.  If I had, this might not have happened.
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
You talk too fast.
Let's go.  Everybody take off?
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!
Want some?
No, please, I don't --
It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo.  My country asked for the best.  I told them that was you.  Now I will show you around my Œhood.
Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?
Last night's as much my fault as yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --
Oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of.  They sent for the Ambassador's personal Chinese Investigator type.  He is like the baddest Asian shield they got.  And I, let me repeat that, I am the man who is on the case with him.  Just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team.
Yeah. So why you look do down?
How about a lift home?
How much they want?
I'm talking about the girl.
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Yo, Johnson...
You a cop or something?
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
You sonuvabitch.
Yes.
My daughter.
You don't understand this guy.
See you at the wedding.
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
What do you expect me to say to this?
Got any last minute advice?
Of course.
We do it to our dog.
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
Lesson number two.  Never work for your former spouse.
If she runs, then it's a cover story. All true.  All accurate.
Don't say "spec" like it's a dirty word. Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a play!  Plato never got a book advance...
Okay, we'll order out.
No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
I have no idea what I'm doing.
Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?
Sorry, no.  I just got one.
Hello.  I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter.  There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...
I am just such a reporter.  And you are?
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
They made me put my hat back on.
Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday...
Really?
Give me that!
I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
I don't know.
Watch your leg, Dad.  I'm so tired of this.
No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.
Where did you disappear to?
To who?  Are you asking me?
You were not.
You're a goddess!
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
But I'm weird.
I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.
You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.
He's going to be the pastor?
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
What?
Maggie, it's just a joke...
You tell Maggie.
Nope.
Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.
I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.
Even when you were young?
I'll wait.
We'll stay at the Plaza --
Miss Scarlett.  In the broom closet.  With the radio.
I do.
Walter.
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
Can too.
Hello.
What?
I love that dream.
Go home for the weekend.
Everybody! Annie has an announcement --
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
Magic.  It was magic.
Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?
Great.  This is great.  The whole town knows.  Just out of curiosity, how do you two know?
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
What are you going to do, Sam?
No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late?
Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
You don't like the one he was now?
I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.
No.
Hey, my plate is full.
You'll find out.
It's Y. O. H.
Do you want an aisle or a window seat?
I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad.
Not.
No, I'm not, but --
Fine.  Fine.
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
How did they get our phone number?
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?
I'm starting to forget her.
Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Case closed. 
Why is she bringing that bag?
What are you doing up?
There's a bathroom upstairs.
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
What if I couldn't get to you?
When I found you?
Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.
Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- you must be Jonah.
What about camping?
Do you like it?
Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done.  Ready to eat.  Do you know how to make juice?
Eventually, in a few months, you'll start seeing women, you'll meet someone.
Anyway, Victoria's nice.
You look good.
We can't finish the job.  She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --
The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
Mornin'.
You haven't tried locking them up!
Now why don't you let these gentlemen pass? Don't you know who's in that car?
How goes it?
Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
Why are they singing, Mama?
To the mine?
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.
So they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.
But you had to have it, didn't you? It was so nice to listen
Forget it.
We did. It got lost in the shuffle.
Now don't start talking against the union again.
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
How do you feel?
A meeting?
When?
You mean you're ready to give up?
Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ...
Hear those deputies slugged 'Cente.
You know I don't think that.
No. New York.
No ...
Well, if that's possible ...
Forgot what?
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. It'll take you right to the highway.
What?
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy.
Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.
All I saw was the headlights. The high beams were on.
Ride 'em cowboy)
Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Jesus, I look like a raccoon.
Oh God.
Could be worse.  Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.
Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers?  I hate the son-of-a-bitch.
That's long enough to get out of town.
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
Why not?
What's wrong, Danny?
What is it?
You're good, princess. I'll give you that.
I knew that if these were the guys I was looking for, I'd have to set up a deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able to walk away from it.
Oh shit
Maybe I am dealing with it.
I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me.
I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?
Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.
You know, Jimmy, you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over.
Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
You're going to have to explain that one.
What does J.F.K. stand for?
Okay
But... why? Why would you pretend?
I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.
I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?
Can we talk price?
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
You want to do this some other time?
I'm sorry?
Don't address me.  I didn't make the accusation.
Shoot him.
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
I've got a hot one.
Danny, I'm touched.
Look, we'll talk to the A.D.A.
I was trying to score some dope.
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
You've got no choice.
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
That's because he doesn't have one.
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
Murder.  Beautiful.
I thought you'd be happy.
He knows somebody ratted him.
Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. I've done everything you guys have asked of me.
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
Who'd have thought it?  Danny "Chickenshit" Flynne trying to go large right under our noses.
Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?
Nervous?
A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.
Tom, quit fucking around.
Golly, I hadn't thought of that.
But, sir...I...I...
I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.
That must be four thousand yards.
Last I knew.
So, that's Ryan.
He's right, we can't shoot him...well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble.  And he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is.
What do you think?
Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...
We left them eighty-eights.
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
I'm in my backyard, lying in my hammock, with my arm around my wife, listening for the sound of breaking glass.
It's worth it.
How about that jeep?
A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going home, if he's alive.
I know about bracketing.  I read about it.  The next one is going to land right on us.
You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire?
I've been humming it.
What is it?
Good luck, Captain.
The men said, nine.
I wonder where they're going.
I can tell what the gunners had for dinner.
What'd you say, Captain?
CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!
Caen?
What about the company?
Simpson?  Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick!
Beasley's dead.
He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys.
You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.
You think they'll be alright?
How about...?
Oh, yeah?
John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive.
What are we going to do?
There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen.
Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.
Captain, can I ask you a question?
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain.
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
Scans the Germans with his binoculars.
You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.
Maybe Caen.
Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.
What deal?
Doesn't move.  He just stares at Sarge's body.
Wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, I can't explain it, but I've seen it.
Shit, sir.
Who cares?
I usually like surprises.
Damn fool.  Sir.
What's the profile?
Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
Gee, it's easy.
Then what's love?
Look at those eyes.
Please?
Wait for me for when I get round to the front. 
Alright, alright, alright, calm down, alright, calm down. Nothing's different.
Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook?  Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, "You're a real live-wire, Love Mr Carroll."  Y'know, it's all so phoney.
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
I'll put this past my boss
Visit her at the home.
Having taken a few courses at the university this year, I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back.
Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
God, that's... this is ridiculous.
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
Morning honey.
Goodnight.
You're not listening to me.
If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.
Honey!
No, you don't know what it is.  It's not for me.  This money's for you, for when you come back from England with honors to set you up, so you don't have to depend on anybody again.  Diane, I take better care of these people than their families do.  I care for them, I give them flowers, I feed them, I wipe their mouths...
This is me telling you about me.
You will?
Thank-you.  The real world.
Yeah.  I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.
Whoah, what a day, huh?
I'll go.
I'll go.
Eight. Eight O' clock.
He does this every year?
Nobody knew me before tonight.
It's just you and your dad, right?
Sure I do.
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
I think you should wear that.
After work?
Me?  Sure I do.
I think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old.  Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours.
Stop by later.
Yes.
No.
Okay, this is important...
Let's get outta here.  You want to?
Check your mail tomorrow.  I sent you a letter, a letter.
We'll see.
Did you talk to Corey?
Did you tell anybody?
You told your dad?
One more time would be nice.
I'm fine.
Okay.
Hey man, I was in love once.  I got hurt really bad.  I never wanna go through that again.
No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
Thanks Lloyd.
She wouldn't get out of the car.  I brought her all the way here, she said she was going to come here, and she wouldn't get out of the car.  But I thought that is was important, that she come to see you, because I know that if you go somewhere and you don't deal with your family stuff, then you're just gonna, she's gonna, um...
Am I going?  Am I going to England?  I've thought about this quite a bit, and I've realised what I probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what I wanna do with my life, do all the stuff that I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other, right?  What's she gonna... she's gonna run off with some English guy?  There's no way.
I know.  But then I reconsidered.  'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter.  I'm good at it.
You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
Lloyd, everybody in that party put something down on their record except you.
This is great, this gives me hope.  Thanks.
I love you man
I love you man.
Well, let's find him.
What?
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
You want these people.
Oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense.
Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out.
Where are the guards?
So I'm responsible for the weather?
I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
Good.  How's it going?
I thought maybe you'd like to come over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over.
I was just the accountant.
You try to be fair to people, they walk out the door;  I've never understood that.  What's next?
I'll talk to him.
Four hundred, four fifty -
Eight hundred, give or take.
They arrived.
I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.
I could've got more ... if I'd just ... I don't know, if I'd just ... I could've got more...
He's stealing from you, Oskar.
How's the name search going?
I would say we are now officially baffled.
That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
Hello? Ted?
You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?
Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
How do you put up with this Greek shit?
Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life?
Where's Sid?
No way.
Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge.
Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?
Where's Sid?
Need some help, honey.
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
You’re the one who got away.
A twist ending if you will.
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
Hello, Dwight.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.
Not good. How you doin?
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
Jesus Christ!
Who is this?
What do you want?
Where are you?
You're getting obvious.
Sidney. Hello. How are you?
Yes, goddammit!
Lucas and his Romper Room stage.
"If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I know, I'll think of you each step of the way...
Can I come with her?
I'm the only one who can cut him down.
The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife. The young girl is helpless...
Randy Meeks.  He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.
I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
..this week's TKE kegger...
Why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? Stupid..
Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've been here all night.
Do you work for her now?
Thanks for the movie, Randy.
No, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Of course it's me, silly. And I feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself. Where are you babe, the movie starts in twenty minutes.
I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.
I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
Asshole, Can't talk.
You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben Damon.
What?! But I did everything you said to do!
You're not playing by the rules Ben. Don't you want her to live?
Where are you?
Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
Can I help you?
I know every face in here, respect for the unknown actor I suppose, myself included. If you're looking for Maureen Prescott --
Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
Jesus Gale what happened?
The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.
Are you sure?
What do you know about trilogies?
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
Detective Kincaid?
Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night.
I can see nothing's changed.
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
Why would the police come to you?
You're not a detective.
I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.
Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.
God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!
Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
Geez.
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
Well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over National TV? Why don't you start talking.
Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
Roman Bridger, director. And brother.  She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie.
See Sid, now comes the part where we get away with it! The part where we win! Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!
Hello.
It's Sarah.
Roman and everybody else went home for the night. I'm here for a make-up test.
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
Duh... that's quick.
You ready to party hard tonight?
Think about it. On the off chance I get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath.
Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight?
Billy? What the...
It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.
You know what my dad will do to you?
Jesus, SHIT!
I'm so sorry... please understand.
You know that's not true.
Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.
So...
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
Who did you call?
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
I don't understand...
What number are you trying to reach?
I don't think so.
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
Why? You wanna ask me out?
Gotta go.
Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else.
My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him...
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
How do you know his name?
Please don't hurt him.
What kind of game?
...please...
Michael... Michael Myers.
But you're doing so well.
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.
Afraid not.
Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there.
He's not a suspect, is he?
I like it. It's... sexy.
I'll call for backup.
What are you doing here?
A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me.
Did you reach my Dad?
I don't know. I guess.
Have they found my father?
Should I be worried?
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
I was first to respond.
She's tough.
She staying with you?
They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.
Where is she?
It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE?
I'll look for it.
Please. You owe me.
You owe my mother.
He was drunk that night. He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him...
She was never attacked. I think she made it all up.
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?
That was an ice pick -- not exactly the same.
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect.
I thought everything was checked out.
What's Leatherface doing here?
There goes my chance with Sid.
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.
Tell your mom I said thanks.
Thanks, Tatum.
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
Take a message.
Come on, Sid.
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
No way.
What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing?
There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.
I thought you dumped her for me.
You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school.
Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened?
Well, there he sits.  It's not supposed to make sense.
And... and... and he said... he asked me if I was married.  And, I could see he had a gun in his hand.
Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!
This guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here.  He wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock.
What do you mean?
It's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct.
You can't see the whole... the whole complete act yet.  Not yet.  But, when this is done, it's going to be... so... so...
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
Innocent?  Is that supposed to be funny? Look at the people I killed.  An obese man, a disgusting man who could barely stand up... who if you saw him on the street, you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you.  Who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish  your meal.  After him I picked the lawyer.  And, you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one.  This was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets.
Somerset...
Let me tell you how I want this to go.  I want you to look, and I want you to listen.
Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  I did all that shit for a long time.
It's a package deal.  You get the phone with the office.
I'd like you to meet Somerset.
Gould's wife.  She was away on business. If this means she saw anything, I don't know what.  We've questioned her at least five times.
No fingerprints?
This is the one thing.
What the fuck is that?
There must be something.
How did the fire fight end?
The way this has gone till now, I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy.
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
I'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
So they ran our list.
Yeah.  Some college student who's taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.
How do you know all about this?
This is a waste of time.
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
He's preaching.
No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.
Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.
You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...
Oh, you want to stay now?
Well... what the fuck, man?
Throw your gun down now!
Tell me it's not true.
Anything... anything missing or different.
This painting...
I hear you and Mills were high school sweethearts.
I was close once.  It just didn't happen.
Perfect example.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
I can't be a burden, especially now.  I know I'll get used to things.  I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks.  Upstate, it was a completely different environment.  I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.
Oh, Tracy... I have to tell you, I'm not the one to talk to about this.
Lucy's going on seventeen now...
Killed every one -- an' not for food either...Why'd they do a thing like that?
What you saw wasn't Lucy.
Another one, eh?
You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'...
Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay...Charlie, hightail it to head- quarters an' spread the word...
You can forget that...  Wouldn't be legal anyway.
You got any more orders, Captain?
Fight fair, son...Use your fists!
I say NO!
My pa wants to know...<U>Colonel</U> <U>Greenhill</U> wants to know how soon you could put a company of your Rangers in the field, fully armed and equipped, for joint punitive action against the Comanches.
Steady, Daniel Boone! You don't want to miss...It makes them think their medicine's stronger than yours...
Told ya, didn't I?
Sir -- we charged!..Gentlemen -- and I hope you will quote me -- I cannot say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that Cheyenne camp...
Not quite...Quarter Cherokee. The rest is Welsh...So they tell me.
Say it. We're beat!
Why?
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
Martin...I want you to know some- thin'...
When are you goin' to learn to keep your mouth shut! Come on. Let's get out of here.
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
Beats me how she could get that pony out o' camp without neither of us hearin' a thing...
Ethan, quit it!
Well, you're a widower now...
Lemme alone...
Why didn't he make his move back there?
How? She's even forgot her own language!
I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive...
I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
I'd be obliged if you'd get to the point, ma'am.
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
Might at least have left me my pants!
Futterman!...He's got a little tradin' post on the South Fork o' the Brazos...Laurie, I just got to get me a good horse! Think yer pa would...
Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!
Martie...don't go! Not this time.
Where?
Say it anyway.  Come on, how much do you love me?
Ellen, move aside...
So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?
Oh, the muse... we're still having our differences.  You know how it is with women.
Maybe the antenna's broken.
Look at this!  We'll have to fix the whole wiring.  This stuff is dangerous as hell.
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.
I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.
Who was that?
It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?
Let me guess:  Another short circuit?
During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner.  What's your point?
You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be.
Hello.  Can I help you?
Ellen Straub.
I guess it's too lonely for most folks.  It's time for me to get going. It's been a pleasure meeting you.
Listen, it's one thing to have a guilt complex. But I know the difference between when I'm overstrung and when I'm seeing things that are simply not there! Besides, it only began after we moved!
Well, look here!
Hey, my man!  How's the masterpiece coming along?
Follow that boat!
What do you want, Kit?
Tomorrow.
What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?
I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
Most interesting.
What's the title?
So what do we do?
Who is she this time?!
Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful -
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
Will! Have you finished?
We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.
Nobody. The author.
Juliet? You mean Ethel.
The show must … you know
The daughter of his enemy.
"Out."
He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona.
Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?
And--?
"Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg'd."
I have, Master Shakespeare.
Who are you, master?
Oh but why "alas?"
You can bring them with a word.
Can you love a fool?
Even your play.
To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
I know how to fight!
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?…she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke…Orsino.
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.
I have spoken with your father.
Will you defy your father and your Queen?
You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.
He is dead?
Wait there.
She loves me, Thomas!
"Poet?"
What's his name?
All right, just a few questions.
Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?
About this guy, this Hugo person.
You mean immoral.
No, not that.
You know what I'm talking about.
I don't know.
How much did you pay?
What is this?
But they know.
They know.
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
It looks like he's writing everything down.
I've never seen any of these men before.
Sorry to waste your time.
When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?
So we'll meet him, then?
Aroused and inflamed.
I'm not usually drunk.
-- which is --
You see, they don't really know me.
Now?
Don't.
Love and happiness for ever.
Look over there. It's Cameron.
I don't see the point in that.
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.
I refuse.
You'll wait in the hall?
And if it sounds like I'm being killed, you'll phone the police, you'll tell them everything?
Interesting.
So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think.
No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
No, nothing, sorry.
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
I see.
Is this where no one stays?
Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not.
Would you like to talk about it?
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
Eh, I don't know.
But I bet you didn't say you were going to split on him.
There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it?
You must be Hugo.
I see.
Writing seems easy.
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
Yes.
Both, sir.
Offering it for debate.
You're in a good mood today, George.
Don't you like her?
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
I just thought you'd like to know --
We cannot go into this later.
Thanks a lot.
She did?
I'm perfectly calm, George, I'm simply saying you have no respect for me, that you're incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average Hollywood... mummers...
-- to be put in that kind of position...
George --
-- Anyway.
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
I know.
Hi.
But aren't you...
Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.
You going to answer it?
Chopped liver?
Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good.
Yeah.
I went to school with her husband.
And you need money?
You do know what money's like these days.
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
So how's Norman?
-- Listen, I'm supposed to take Jill to El Cholo tonight. She's really going to be pissed if I don't.
I'm sure.
Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.
If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you.
George... how about Felicia?
You know what I'm talking about.
Now, baby... if I told you about her... then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore... could you?
Baby...
One of my few virtues is discretion.
Sit down.
-- what guy?
He just completely ignores me. He could have at least said something, introduced me or something.
-- gee...
Am I entertaining you?
-- we're kidding ourselves.
-- It's Malone's.
I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone.
Hey, what's happening?  Mary! Telephone.  What's the matter?
What with?
That boy always does great. He's a corporal or a squad leader or something, just wrote me from some place called Kwang Due?
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
Hi, George.
Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside.
I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.
I am, I am. But I've had it with chicks. They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something.
You've never even been around one.
George.
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Jill, say hello to Felicia.
Whether or not I'm going.
Egypt.
What do you want?
Television or movies?
-- well aren't you --
I don't want to fight, George.
That was him.
-- and take this with you.
So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?
Obviously.
What difference does it make?
What? What? What? What? What?
Please!... that's not like you.
You need a cut.
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
... she's very upset...
George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.
-- do me a favor, kind of keep your eye on Jackie, she's a little high strung tonight --
You live like a pig.
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
Godammit, George...
... yes, I follow your thinking on that.
Have a drink.
Me!
She's nothing but a whore.
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.

You're home.
I was too old.
Yes.
Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
You and your touchy investors.
You're lying about one thing, Lester.
Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.
I am? I mean why?
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
It must be something.
-- Yeah, honey...
What?
C'mon.
Oh. thank you.
George? Was he alone?
-- why?
You're going?
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
Do you have children?
No of course not.
Everything okay, son?
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
How's it going, Doc?
Now this is where we keep all of out meat.  You got fifteen rib roasts - thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers.  You got twelve- turkeys, two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb.  Do you like lamb, Doc?
Why don't you want to talk about it?
Who's Tony?
Room 237?
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!
Please...
How did he manage to do that?
Sure.
That doesn't matter, sir.  You're the important one.
Grady?
No.
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady. I'll deal with that situation as soon as I get out of here.
Good evening.  Forest Service.
Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.
Glad to meet you, Winifred.
Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred.  Now are you a Winnie or a Freddie?
No, we don't mind.
Bill, how do you do?
I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet.
What'll it be?
Best goddamned bartender from Timbuctoo to Portland Maine - Portland Oregon for that matter.
Hi Lloyd.  I've been away.  Now I'm back.
No charge?
Hi, babe.
Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.
Perfect for a child.
Any ideas yet?
or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in.  Now do you think you can handle that?
You went into the room Danny said - to 237?
Jack!
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?
Stay away from me,
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me.
Jack, stay away from me!
Have any trouble finding us?
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
Well, obviously some people can be
Right there.
The moon's not down yet...
You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!
Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting here all morning.
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
You all right, Marty?
There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing that is just a... a...
What is it?
It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's wearing an eye-patch!
Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.
It could have been anything, Marty.
Yeah? Really?
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
You know, I just might!
So, hi there.  I'm... Sister Mary Clarence.  And you're... young Christians.  I guess I should assign you this passage.  What's good?  What were you talking about?
How are you doing.
What do you want?  This is a private area!  Get lost!
Come on -- stay.  Just a little.  We can talk, I'll get a pizza.  Pizza in bed, we'll have fun.  And you still haven't told me what happened.  What did she say?
How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
I want us to be together.  Like people. Honest, decent people.  In the eyes of God.  Babe, today... I went to confession.
What? 
Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's God!
I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp!
This prom is a real drag.
Look at that.  Get a gander.
1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows.  It's the last secular music we recall.
The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver.  Have you ever used a loom?
Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours.
Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?
SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE I'LL BE HIS AND HE'LL BE MINE WE'LL LOVE UNTIL THE END OF TIME AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE
Jackpot!  Two buckets
Mary Clarence, are you with us?
What?
Yeah, for one second.  That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other.  Be a group.
It'll be hell.
Van Cartier.
What?  What does she want now?  I did the dishes.  I oiled the pews.  I dusted the hymnals.  Two hundred hymnals.  Why can't people share?
So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's?
No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
We must do this sacred thing, Mary Robert.
Mary Clarence!
Who are all these people?
I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
St. Anne's?
The reason?
And all those like you.
Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"
Is this all the food I get?
Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping- Pong?  Row over to the monastery?
This is a convent, not a clinic.  We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your behavior was inexcusable!
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
You may stay.  But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.
What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
Right between the eyes!  Down and out! The guy was gone!  I... I couldn't believe it!
I don't know anything about bodies!  I mean, he didn't bring it home.  He was good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let me sing.
And if I don't?
Okay, here's what I want.  I know about this stuff.  A five-star hotel.  With room service.
Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em.
And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna take.
Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
Like what?
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.
I really can't talk about it now.  The place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show to do.
I've got to go.
I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
Hey, girls.
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
And if she runs?
But, Vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?
Joey?
A sweater.
It should be here any minute.
Yes, Mary Patrick?
I'd rather sing than do anything!
Ice cream!
Mary Clarence!  Sister!
We can't sing without her!  What should we do?
Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
Reverend Mother?
If we could speak alone.
Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.
No bleeding.
Keep still, Constable.  You were half-drowned when they found you.
Your superiors are two days away!
For poaching.  Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?
Just a moment... if I may.  It is possible this man was murdered.
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands.  It is named Sleepy Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off.  The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
Listen to what you say....
I manage fine alone.
We are leaving.
We should not go much further in this murk.
What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?
Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?
Someone left last night.  Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest.
If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet?
Did your father take a loan?
I was getting worried.  Who was it?
What was she doing?
Why... why are you like this?
What now?
My suitor?
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
These scars.  How did you get them?
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
Oh, you are hopeless.  May I keep it at least?
Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
People have put their trust in you.
Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?
It is only me.
I apologize if I worried you.
Blood.
What is so urgent?
You cannot kill what is already dead.
There was not much blood, was there?
Van Ripper, turn the coach about!
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
I hear him.  He rides to the Hollow and back.
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.
He rides tonight.
All right then.
All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin' along on that garden tiller?
Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. Ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything.  But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him.
Can I help you?
Did you decide, sir?
I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead.  He got hit by a train.
About a half a mile I think it is.
Yeah.
You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.
Well, it's on! We're gonna rock. Linda, call Vaughan. Tell him to get over here. I'd like him to be here. I owe him a good time.
Leave.
I ain't sure.
I want to watch T.V.
Last time you got mad and run Morris and them off and said to stay away from here.
We don't have a goddamn band! Y'all just shut the fuck up! We don't need no practicin' or managers cause we ain't no fuckin' band! Morris ain't no genius and the rest of you are just losers. Am I the only one sane human bein' around here? Just get the hell out of my house and don't come back!
I want to be baptized.
Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em?  I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.
Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.
Can you go there with us now? Me and Karl. We could just hang out. Karl has some cool books.
Why'd you live there?
This is what I call my secret place 'cause I come out here when I feel like bein' by myself. I used to come here with Karen Cross. She's kind of like my girlfriend, or used to be. She says she likes Jerry Maroney now. But I'm gonna get her back 'cause I love her. We used to come here and hold hands and talk and read books to each other with a flashlight. She didn't want to have anything to do with me in front of other people 'cause I don't have any money. Well, mama and me, I mean. She seemed to like me a whole lot when we were out here though. She said she loved me, too. Out here. Settin' right on that stump you're on. See, her daddy's a dentist so they're rich. So's Jerry Maroney's daddy. He owns the ice plant. Was your folks well off?
I've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died. Sometimes I wish I was still real little and he was still here. My mama's real good, but I wish I had both of 'em.  When we went to Memphis one time in the car, it was rainin' so hard we couldn't see the road. But I wadn't scared because I thought as long as daddy was drivin' nothin' could happen to us. I feel that way about mama now.  Mama has a boyfriend now. His name is Doyle Hargraves. He works construction so he makes a pretty good livin'. He still don't help mama out with any money though. He ain't no good. He's mean to her. He don't like me at all. Mama says it's because he's jealous I belong to my daddy instead of him. He stays with us all night sometimes, but he's got his own house. Somebody told me it's so he can still have other girlfriends. I like it on the nights when he ain't at our house. I'm not so nervous then.
It ain't the truth. He shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose.
I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it?
I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
So it died when it come out?
You threw it in a trash barrel?
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
Yeah.
I know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me.
Just diggin'.  I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. I wish me and you and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn't ever born.
You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off.
I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
He's no more an Indian than I am though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just ignore it. Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. I guarantee it.
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
Yes ma'am, I reckon.
These is the worst shoes I own for walkin'. How far did you want to go?
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.
Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody?
Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?
Do they know about you?
Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
Yes ma'am.
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four, but I always heard about it growin' up.  They say you're well?
Karl, why don't you and Melinda go take a walk. It's nice out.
You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?
Well, okay. I got you some.
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
That boy wants me to.
I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way.  There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?
Let's just go, Marsha.
Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage.  Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?
I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry. I made myself pretty clear I thought. He probably got busy and wasn't thinking. I know how that is. I used to teach shop and eighth grade science.
Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.
And what are you, his chaperone?
And your father? Is he from New York?
Not an easy book.
Jesus, what happened to you?
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
Do me a favor, will you?
Hey, Auggie. How's it going?
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.
Are you closed?
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
I didn't know you took pictures.
How'd you get started?
I've never seen anything like it.
Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from that year. She must have been on her way to work.
So, what brings you to a dive like this?
The kid's sorry, Auggie.
So what did he say when he called?
You usually get two.
I have to pee.  If the waiter comes, order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale, okay?
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
It was a good deed, Auggie. It was a nice thing you did for her.
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you?
Talk away, lady of my dreams. I'm all ears.
All right, sugar, what's on your mind?
Like what?
That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
I told her she was going to meet her father.
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
Still, you can't just write her off.
Fuck this angel shit. Just take the dough, Ruby. But no bawling, okay? I can't stand people who blubber.
Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
Come on, come on, you yellow belly. The whole thing. First name and last name.
It'll never be finished.
That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.
And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.
Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it?
Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
And have you mended them?
That's funny. His name is the same as yours.
Yeah? Who is it?
Sure. He's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle.
I just happened to be there.  The right place at the right time.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
Yeah, sure, and I bet you had lobster last night. Along with two bottles of champagne.
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
Two or three nights.
Hey, it's you.
Where did you get that thing?
And?
I just happened to be walking by... All of a sudden, the Creeper and this other guy come running out of this check-cashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands... They just about ran smack into me. The Creeper recognized me, and I knew he knew I recognized him... If the guy from the check-cashing place hadn't rushed out then screaming bloody murder, he would have shot me. I'm telling you, the Creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk. But the noise distracted him, and when he turned around to see what was happening, I took off... One more second, and I would have been dead.
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
That's because we don't belong anywhere. You don't fit into your world, and I don't fit into mine. We're the outcasts of the universe.
Let's not get too idealistic.
Ah, coffee. Smells good.
Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.
Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.
His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
Well?
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
Cuban cigars. You mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys?
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
We came here to deliver some clean laundry.
Fries?
The battery's in, that's done with.  Besides, you'd do the same for m...
Why?  If they could never take title.
Now defendant's father had also died by that point.  Where was the defendant?  When you sent his family their equity.
Just three questions.  The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
It is.
Boat has two batteries.  Lose one you run off the other til morning. Carl musta lost both, so Miyamoto there gave him one a his.
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him?
Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks.  Even though they should be.  They're about what people <u>believe</u> is true.
My father can't get our money from the bank.  We have a few dol...
We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t...
You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael.  Not once, not ever.  There's no half- way.  As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go.
You don't believe in God anymore.
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a <u>single</u> overturned <u>cup</u> in its wake?
And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful.  At a tactic that insults their intelligence.
Robbed.  He was angry.
But Carl was a fisherman.  And successful at it.
I should have told everything right away.  I know that now, and I regret it.
You mean, early morning the 16th?
Never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place.
Well, why does it?
Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left.  Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing.  But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
Still and all.  Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
Does it now?
You found three batteries, you say.  A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?
I believe so.
Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?
How <u>is</u> your mother-in-law?
So this...foam you found in the lungs.  How does it get there?
In your motorcycle example.  Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled <u>against</u> an object. Rather than the reverse, yes?
Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.
The question is more about the <u>defendant's</u> attitu...
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
Those idiot broads!  Here we are all packed to go to Miami, and what happens?  The saxophone runs off with a Bible salesman, and the bass fiddle gets herself pregnant.  I ought to fire you, Bienstock.
You're welcome.
Because I lost a filling in my back tooth. I gotta go to the dentist tomorrow.
It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
But suppose he loses?
Greased Lightning!  Why do I listen to you? I ought to have my head examined!
You mean it's a girls' band?
No.  And he ain't been eating so good, either. He's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head.
You don't see any blood?
Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
How about that talent?  This is like falling into a tub of butter.
Steady, boy.  Just keep telling yourself you're a girl.
But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
What's going on here?  Daphne - Daphne -
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
What's the beef?  We're sitting pretty. We get room and board - we get paid every week - there's the palm trees and the flying fish -
Me?  After Sugar?
What is it, young lady?  What are you staring at?
I heard a very sad story about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.  She squealed on her roommate, and they found her strangled with her own brassiere.
He's not only got a yacht, he's got a bicycle.
Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?
I'll say there is!
Oh.
Hey - these are real diamonds.
What are you giving me with the omelette?
Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -
Are my seams straight?
And that's one of them.
Who needs vermouth?
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.
What do you mean, maybe?  I saw the way he looked at you.  He'll be there for sure.
How did you get that bracelet?
I always did.
Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff, in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a couple of girl musicians available? A sax player and a base?
If there is one thing I admire, it's a girl with a shapely ankle.
Mama is keeping score.  Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
If I promise not to be a naughty boy - how about dinner tonight?
Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.
Daphne...
I called Mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it's white lace.
Oh?
Please, Jerry - that's no way to talk.  Nellie baby - what are you doing tonight?
No, we couldn't!
Well, here we are.
Hey, Sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances?
Tell what?
Yes.  I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.
If Bienstock catches you again - What's the matter with you, anyway?
Then why did you take this job?
Afford it?
Yeah.
You don't say?
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
Millionaires.  Flocks of them.  They all go south for the winter.  Like birds.
What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.
I wish you'd make sure.
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
So do I.  as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.
I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
And you will come to hear us tonight?
Josephine.
Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
Three?
My dad is more interested in railroads. Baltimore and Ohio.  Which is the port and which is the starboard?
Oh - in here.
It's exquisite - like a floating mansion.
What is it?
Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
Where's your shell collection?
What's on Thursdays?
You mean we're alone on the boat?
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
What thing?
I don't want to bore you.
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?
Anything this time?
Would you like a little more champagne?  And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights?
You're not giving yourself a chance. Don't fight it.  Relax. 
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Gee, I wish I'd been there.
What's the matter, Sugar?
Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?
Good evening, sir.
What'll it be, sir?
Okay, Spats - the services are over. Lets go.
Come on, Spats - we know you own this joint.  Mozarella is just fronting for you.
Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
Refresh my memory.
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Too bad, Charlie.  You would have had three eights.  Goodbye, Charlie!
Did Kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath?
I should get going.
We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend.  I was fourteen.
Fred Astaire and what’s her face!
Sorry to interrupt. Your dad sent me.
I’d be happy to. You’re welcome.
There’s a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
Hey, man.
Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, we’re the past. I’m not sure if you noticed, but I’m here with someone else.
It’s called character. God, you’re predictable.
That was a long time ago.
Bollocks, I’m sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult.
It’s the past. It’s nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then let’s go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.
What color are my shoes?
That won’t be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.
You quitting?
I love that you’re asking questions, but do you really want to get into all of this?
I swear. I don’t have a signature move.
Don’t they have a limit at those machines?
And what if I didn’t want you to...to do that to me?
What?
I just hate seeing you so stuck.
Yeah. You?
And that’s when he peed in his pants? After the tart?
You’re right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.
Nice speech. I thought it was “touching”... and “funny.”
Like fifteen.
Hey, Sal.
I’m worried. Amy’s not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  Is it ‘drunker’ or ‘drunker-er’?
What do you say to that?
I just wanta wash my hand. It's got blood where I hurt it.
Here it is, right here.
Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
:--THE STRANGE ENDINGS OF NATURE THEY HAVE SEEN, MAY GIVE THE WORLD NEW POINTS OF VIEW AND MAKE THEIR LOVING, LIVING, AND DOING PRECIOUS TO ALL HUMAN...
But, Charlie --
I see you found what you was lookin' for.
David Lee...
When the fall comes in these parts, the Night moon runs away like a rabbit -- you could stay out here lookin' all night, and not see a thing out yonder.
Well, looka here...
Goodnight, Daddy...
Daddy, when is we goin' huntin'?
David, you never cease to amaze me at how good you are in taking care of my garden.
Where did it come from, Mama?
You got two shirts on?
Can I go when the holiday comes?
Poor creature...
What's wrong with him, David?
Would you like to have a cool drink, David?
I'll find out where your daddy is for you.
Don't take all day at that table, David Lee.
Is he gon' be gone long?
I bet you could use a hot cup of coffee, Nathan Lee.
Good mornin', Nathan.
How's the weather out there?
If there ever was a devil in this county, Ike, you is it!
This done happen before. It ain't nothin' -- I just have to wait a minute or two.
I just got out here!
But, Nathan--
It's the rules and I gotta follow 'em. No visitin' 'cept holidays and Sunday -- and no womenfolk anytime.
I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble.
NO WAY, DUDE! I'VE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR YOU, AND NOW YOU HAVE TO TELL ME HOW TO GET WENDY TO LIKE ME!!
YOU JUST DON'T CARE!
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa-
Man, that movie gets better every time I see it!
Come on, just get to the message board!
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
CARTMAN!
Mph rm rmph!!
If you went down on a horse... You'd tell me, right?
Eric, you're not watching your mouth!
What?
You bastards.
What's going on, Chef?
Oops, I guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class, huh?
Very well, then. I will put an end to the war as your wish and make everything as it was before the war started. But you Kenny, must remain dead.
Hey, relax Satan. Don't get all worked up. You're gonna give yourself an ulcer again.
Terrance and Phillip, you are under arrest for working in America without the proper documents! WE GOT YOU!
SHIT!
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!
Hey, dudes... Aren't you supposed to go to church, Kenny?
This is terrible! This can't be happening!!
That was sweet!
Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip!
Dude, do you know what you're doing?
I thought you had something planned.
WHAT?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals!
Shiteater-
Article 42!  You don't mean-?!
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
Hello, Conan!
Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!!
You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!
I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.
You know I do.
No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't just renege on a deal. That's lying.
Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut!
Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?
Stan, I never cared for Gregory.
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for-</b>
You don't have watches?
Getting drunk is no solution.
I think we're moving.
Jesus, come on!
Koros, as in...Koros?  Dimitri Koros?
Well I appreciate that.
So...
Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.
Where the hell did you come from?
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
There is a high level...of passenger 					dissatisfaction.
No, I just ran it!  Why are you running it again?
What, and leave you here all by your lonesome?
Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
Ok, I will.  The bad news is the ship is history.  Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.
Look we gave you what you asked for.  It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us!
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
Well, more power to you.  Me, I start to bug out after too much time out here.
Well, let me put it this way.  Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.
He certainly is polite.
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.
Dawn!  Dawn!
Oh my God.  What happened?
I will once I get past the bulkhead.  Good luck.
He's out of the equation.  Talk to me.
Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!
Uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now I'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.
So what's going to happen to you?
I never thought this would happen.  No premonitions, nothing.
Thank you.
Carlo!
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
Well now what are we gonna do!
You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!
Look.  We're talking about life and death here.  I don't know why we're even having this conversation.
I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?
Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
But the corridor outside this door is open, correct?
99 years, 241 days,  15 hours, and 20 minutes of no bowling. Alfie shuffles up to the self-serve island and begins wiping it down.
You a mini-golfer?
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
Sorry about your loss.
Fazeli...I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.
Buzz, Mr. Kastle wants to talk to you.
Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you...  What was that he said...?
Bowling used to be so pure, so...All- American. Breeze sings along with Caruso and pretends to conduct.
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
Think he bought it?
And look at that; both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz.
What do you think I can do?
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
I don't know no Grace Skinner.
Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma.
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
What the fuck is this?
I do what I gotta do to survive.
I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.
Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television.
Listen, if straight doesn't work out, you come work for me.  Just make sure nobody's following you. Buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset, his halo bouncing in the breeze.
You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.
Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin!
He's the guy Buzz.
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
How's that?
It depends.
Knock-knock.
JUNIOR!  You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
What did you do to Buzz?
Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.
Someone gonna get kacked, boss?
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.
Nice set-up.
Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy.
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
I bet you didn't know that you and Junior have something in common, Theo: Junior can't bowl anymore either. Isn't that right Junior? Kastle SLAMS the ketchup bottle down on Junior's right hand. The table settings jump from the shock. Junior sits impassively, his face a blank.
You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!
Don't go near the bowling alley.
I just hold it loosely with both hands?
Grasp firmly. Then what?
Yeah.
Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything, but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die.
This is a vicious cycle.
Where did your brother escape from?
Do you have a girlfriend?
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?
What do you think my dad's gonna do for you?
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
What? Be my body guard?  Here's my body, Theo. Guard it. For my dad's sake. For your career. Sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt.
I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
These open the back door. Don't let him catch you behind the machines; if he does, you're trapped. I'll meet you at the bridge. Theo takes the keys. Sheila grabs his arm.
You told Junior that we did it.
He's dead Sheila.
Why did you come back?
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
My word is good, and it'll always be good. When did I ever give my word to you?
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
Why is Junior's watch in that coffin? Something stinks around here.
Fletcher, get away from there...
Fletcher!  Now!
Wait a minute --
Hold on --
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
Increase positive pressure!
What have you been told so far?
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
We're moving fast considering the storm.
How deep is he?
Then why am I here?
What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
-- dating the crash at least that old.
Extraordinary, isn't it?
Don't get hysterical, Norman.
You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.
Damn it, Edmunds?
What the hell?  It shut us down.
Yes, sir.  I'm here.
Subs are still at surface, sir.
I'm getting no sub reading, sir.
Nothing, sir.
I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped.
So?  What's the problem?
Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
Edmunds?  Get in here.  I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.
Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
Ted, get her away from the door.
Norman!
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific.  At my mother's beach house.  We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.
What do you mean -- not normal?
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?
I didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't mean...
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
Don't tell me to calm down!
You said something to him, didn't you?
Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --
Four days?
I don't trust Harry to do it.
You fixed my suit?
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
That wasn't in there before.
No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry.
I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
Diphenyl parlene.
A synthetic opium analogue.
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
Riordan?
Parasolutrine?
It's an idea.
I'm sorry.
The sphere looks different.
How do you feel about snakes?
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.
You're lying --
Shut up, Beth --
Beth --
It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.
Then where's it coming from?
Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.
What is that?  What are you doing?
You hear that?
Get away from me!
Pussy.
No.  I don't think so.
It's empty.  Why would someone build a ship like this?
What?
When did it come across?
Our answer.
Don't be so optomistic, Harry.
Not a clue.
What is that?  That noise?
You remember opening the door?
Norman?
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
You don't remember that?
Wisconsin's your answer.
Did I kill her?
How much time you figure to get to the surface?
C'mon, Norman!
Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.
Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.
Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...
Why would this ship carry instructions in English?
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
Beth and Harry?
That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier...
What report?
Try this one.
Well, he's polite.
You want to put him on your couch, Norman.  Grill him about his childhood?
What was it?
You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds?  With what's out there?
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
How much do you think she's talking about?
We're into the second perimeter. They'll be coming out to blast us shortly.  I was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in?
Darth Vader is on this system.  I can feel him.  I can feel the Kiber Crystal.
Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.
When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?
Are you all right?
You're Starkiller?
Have you been checked out?
Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on.
Blue Five, does that glare bother you?
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...
Maybe you should just drop us off. I'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk.
Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.
Is he afraid of the water?
First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.
There's a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action...
You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?
Let him have it.  You're winning anyway.  It doesn't make any difference.
You rich kids... are all the same !
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
I say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together.
No way. Big K taught me I ain't executive material.
We'll take this high ground. Lookouts there and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we'll be the first to know.
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
Yeah, but I want Carmen.
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain.
I hear they need a new Lieutenant... Want the job ?
Or...?
Well, whad'ya know...
Johnny, wait...
Let's disregaed rank... Everybody hear that ? Rank is not an issue here.
I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen.
So ?
Carmen...?
I'm sorry, Carmen.
That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
How do you feel about him now ?
Eeuch !
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
Isn't it great to be in love ?
He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?
Zander is going for pilot, too.
He's nothing like you.
You talk to Carl ?
Shhhh...!
What happened to your hair ?
It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
Take care, wilya Johnny ?
Good work, Number 1. You'll do.
Plasma, ma'am... from the planet.
Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.
You still gonna play for Brazil ?
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
Can't we just be friends, Diz ?
Hey, amigo, come chow with me.
It stinks, you goin.
You used to dance...
Hey, Diz...
Diz, see what you can do.
What frequency ?
Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.
This came for you today. I presume on your request.
Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life.
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?
Corporal, I want pulse cannons there and there ! Rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that flame thrower !
I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.
You knew the Lieutenant before the war... What was he like ?
Best in the Fleet !
On whose authority, Corporal ?
You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant !
What's your problem now, Lieutenant ?
This is Rodger Young... What's going on down there ? We're taking plasma ! We have Orion P-11 as clear !
Mister Rasczak ?
I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
What's that look like to you, Rico ?
Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?
The carbon-units are not responsible for that.
Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units.
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander.
Yes.
That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.
Granted.
Captain, what's the next move?
    , if we do not provide     V'ger with certain information, we won't have twenty-two <U>seconds</U>; the plan must be implemented upon arrival.
Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately.
The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.  The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.
Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens.
Exactly.  And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.
Forward motion, Captain...!
Negative control from inertial lag will continue 22 point five seconds before forward velocity slows to sub-light speed.
Mr. Spock?
Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.
Clear the bridge, Captain...?
Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that...
Admiral, the Enterprise has just finished eighteen months redesign- ing and refitting. She needs testing, a shakedown...
We're losing the pattern...!
You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth?
I still contain fragments of my human half.
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.
Have you been able to analyze <U>any</U> of this...?
Bridge, cancel rescue teams.  Spock, what in the hell are you doing out here!
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
Why aren't you on board?
Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?
Then you'll be wet.
You bringing your new friend?
He have any special dietary requirements...?
You're doing a <u>Play</u>...
...small town.  I suppose.  You have to make your own fun.
I quit.
I quit the movie.
Why?
I...
Ever wonder why the dalmation's the symbol of the firehouse?
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
The, the, the, the <u>sanctity</u> of everyday things...
Really.  With the porch swing and everything...
How can you <u>say</u> that?
I...
Me?
"Rise, one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice."
...lost the screw...
Me, too.  You have a paperclip?
Fix my glasses.
Gonna' be good as new.
Great.  Who is it...?
It's for your finger.
Don't you think you should put them in water?
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
Why?
Because it's about <u>purity</u>...
I didn't say anything special, I was just talking out loud.
Would you like to <u>see</u> it?  I've got the key back at my store...
...and we could get up every morning...
To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
Lookit that, up already.
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
What are you going to do?
I'm glad you asked...I'll <u>tell</u> you what was wrong with it.  And what was wrong with it was it was behind the times. Now:  You want to bring <u>business</u> into this town?  You have to plan for a Waterford that Does Not Exist.  Not at the moment, <u>no</u>...
S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?
Annie:  you stick to the Amateur Theatricals.  This isn't quite the same thing, you see?  This is Big Business, in which, our Life...  ...s'no less a <u>commodity</u> than...than our...
We on for tomorrow night?
Ten thousand dollars.
We did...?
I've been thinking.
I wasn't doing business.
Rewrites that Bob Barrenger requested... the "dead horse scene," the...
Fourteen year old girls.
It's Marty on the Coast -
Have you got the new pages on the Old Mill?  Hey, Bob.
Mornin, sister.
Well, I can offer you something to drink?
What do you drink?
Her...
So you see what I'm <u>saying</u>...the movie is about <u>purity</u>...
We're going to discuss the scr...you wanna come along...?
I have to ask you these...um.  You have a valid drivers license...?
I've got scene <u>twelve</u>...  Shouldn't you be in school...?
Aren't you ever in school?
And I have Mr. Barrenger's Tuna B...
I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
You have no right to...
Look.
But not that <u>way</u>...
Will you help me out...?
Hi.  I hope I'm not disturbing...
We're just talking about the...
What, what's there to <u>think</u> about?  The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...
I know that, Claire.  I, we <u>all</u> know...
...I...
Wally...
And you know what...?
Not now, I'm talking to the press. Claire!
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
...yes...
You show Claire these sketches?
-- she's got 'religion.'
Aren't you supposed to set an example for people...?
...little woman has gone crazy about our dinner party...City Council...?  What's the trouble...?
Arrest him.
Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom?
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...
He didn't have to tell...
What's in the case?
And what was it you wanted to say?
My wife's going to have a baby.
Mmmm.  You have children?
Who's White...?
Town's out of lilacs.
I...
...totally false...<u>totally</u> false.  He is the, I would say the most responsible human being I have ever...
I'm trying, honey...I'm...look, is your Ma, when is your <u>Mom</u> coming?  Oh.  What did the <u>midwife</u>...?
I...?
Does it have to be an Old Mill?  Where have you been?
Halo?  <u>Marty</u>?  What would they have used instead of an old mill?  We need it tonight.  Marty?  Yeah you were saying...?
Grace, get on the other phone, call that girl: well, call her, and have whatsername send up some <u>nosh</u>...what do you like to drink...?
Thank God, it's up to you, Pal.  Sup to you...
<u>Siddown</u>!
How do they know that, you told them?
I...
What's in all the bags?
It's just a formality.
I want them thrown in jail.
Well, you know, Walt, I just wanted to say that anything I could do...
Well, these things happen.  <u>Purpose</u> of my call, my wife wanted to know what brand of <u>cigarettes</u> Mr. Barrenger smokes, so she could lay some out tonight...we got the list of his dietary <u>requirements</u>...
...the damn thing...
She coulda done better than him.
You see where Tom Miller's playin' the Old Farmer?
I read for that part.  Did pretty good too.
We have to lose the window.
Why?
Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.
I hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt...
I hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up.
It just slipped out.
Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops.  I fear for the women and the property values.
Daddy was washing Rachel.  In the shower.  What did you think that was about?
Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...
I hope it's the right kind.
She is only the <u>Princess</u> of Cool. <u>Mommy</u> is the Queen!
Annabelle...wake up honey...
Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad.
Hold lunch!
C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom...
It's not to wear around, or any- thing, I'm <u>way</u> too young.  It's just for play.
That doesn't bother me.
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
I hate her.  I really hate her.
No they're not.
...your hating me.
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
Are you <u>real</u> mad?
'In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you... held you so ti-ight'...take it, man...
Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have underpants of her own?
Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.
I think she's pretty, Mommy.
Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
No.
So you're okay.
Find the bird cage?
The world.  <u>Thinks</u> I'm gone.  But only the magician.  Knows better.
So we'll...radiate some more?
Planning on getting --
Because you don't really seem here.
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...
You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> well-being.
It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there.
It's temporary.
What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you?
Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?
Yeh?
Jackie, if I thought for one moment...
She already hates me.  You've seen to that.
I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park.
I'm sorry, I just...
What about obsessively picking her split ends?
I don't know wh...
Look, you've never liked me...
Eat your heart out.  Is Annabelle there?
Yah?  Well, even the best mom in the world, the smartest, the wisest, whatever.  Needs to know when to find a Plan B.  Cos Plan A <u>is</u> not and <u>will</u> n...
Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna.  I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...
I know you, huh?  The car pools, he measles, the PTA.  It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  You have to think long term.
You really didn't have to come, you know.  I'd have brought them straight t...
She likes a Stolie, no ice.
I never wanted to be a mom.  Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life...
Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
We have the kids this weekend, so...
You don't trust me to be alone with them.
Not yet.
Just like to make sure.  That your past.  And my future.  Are real different.
'But keep dancing, and if you're lucky, I might just never leave, who knows?'
We make our lives, one step at a time.  We do the best we can.  The truth about the future?  A promise. Is only a hope.
We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies.
Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
Must've been hard being poor.
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
Consuelo, what is rape exactly?
So whaddya think?
This is definitely better.
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
Twinkeys!
Mom?
We did the same thing last year also.
You're tired of me. I can tell.
What do you want?
Marcus...You'll write something better next time!
Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
And you want Scooby to be the focus of all this?
I dunno.
So? How was school today?
The same. Same as what?
Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the f-word and I can't.
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
It's over there.
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
Ni...
Nigger.
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
I dunno...
But...you called.
So. Look at where we are: the year 2000! Can you believe it? I mean, did you ever think we would actually make it?
OK. Bye.
Pretty cool, Stanley.
Whoopee.
Hey, um, Toby? I was wondering…Is the documentary almost finished?
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
Henry, what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding?
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
Just get me a coke and don't argue with me, OK?
Forget about it.
He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
How's the arm?
That's it!  Up ahead!
I know you're not too happy at this point.  It's too bad we weren't able to meet elsewhere, under different circumstances...
Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!
Our traveler's insurance, you know what I mean?
Of the separate chemicals--I don't know, uh, offhand--
Please be calm, Ambassador De Sade.
Possibly some coffee?
Well, it has been explained to me that, if you add a thick Cobalt-Thorium-G jacket to a nuclear device, the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years.
But, finally, one factor tipped the scales. We received information from a very re- liable source that your country was going to build one.
Yes?
Perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source?
Please, Mister President, I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation.  Here is the only other camera I have left. 
Do you have any witnesses, Major?
Okay, fella.  But just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me.
Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator...  Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine.  There's bound to be enough change in there.
Yes!
Well, Mister President.
Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?
I didn't speak to him, sir.  But Colonel "Bat" Guano was in command of the Special Service battalion, so I would imagine he did.
Yes, sir.
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
Let me worry about that, Major. I've still got my red line to the Air Command.
We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
Are you questioning my orders, Major?
How much soda, sir.
That about right?
I see.
I guess so.
And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.
Right.
Major, you're talking like one of them!
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
How could you let this happen, General Schmuck?
Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?
You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.
Maximum ECM.
War.
Check.
Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.
Yeah, I got it in the thigh.
Roger.
Sorry, King.  My leg's stiff as a board.
Could you take her up right now, King?  Other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.
Hey, King.  Somebody at Burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor.
Lieutenant Toejam, are you ready for Bim and Bam?
So am I.
No kidding.
That's what I said.
Fusing for ten thousand air burst.
How do you know he's dead?
Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.
I'm okay.  What's up?
There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?
King, would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in?
When they emerge, a good deal of present real estate and machine tools will still be recoverable, if they are moth-balled in advance.  I would guess they could then work their way back to our present gross national product within twenty years.
Mn-hm.
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.
Yeah!
Uh-huh.
Typical male.
No I quit.
It's really not about anything.
Any gunshot victims?
Yeah.
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
It's your birthday?
Jesus Christ.
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
So, do you guys want to do something, go someplace or something like that?
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
No. Life is too short.
Hey, you know me.
Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
Hey, man.
Yeah.
Hey, come on, man! Limo!
Hey! On behalf of Burnfield, I present to you the keys to the city.
Oh, you were in the band?
What do you mean? His girlfriend?
Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain.
So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?
Whoa!
Thanks. See man?
You make videos?
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
Yeah!
You okay, man? You okay?
Hey, play that demo again, man. Alright.
You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk.
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
He is.
You got everything right but the car. My dad didn't get me a BMW.
A Porsche.
I mean, what is there to be happy about really? I mean, going to the gym, climbing the StairMaster, eating the yogurt, checking the voice mail. Smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving the bikini line. Sometimes I just want something different, you know?
Erica.
I'd love to read that.
Erica, you coming?
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
You don't need to sit next to me right now.
Yeah, yeah, I stay at the Four Seas, it's ease.
Wow, you're cute when you're angry.
I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.
See ya later.
Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
What? What'd you do?
They let you out?
Well, what am I supposed to sleep off? My life? You know, I'm supposed to go home and go to sleep and when I wake up, what'll I be, Jeff? A pilot? Maybe a Super Bowl quarterback or, no, maybe a fucking rock star. Right? I don't think so, man.
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
Oh! Trim it!
No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.
Yes, you asshole.
This is ridiculous!
It was a racial incident.
Oh, yeah?
Okay, what would you have done.
What?
What feelings?
My goal is to make art.
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
What?
Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, 'cause I, there's something I figured out.
No, no, I have to talk to you.
Do your covers and all that shit.
Good, man.
Yeah.
For a while.
So, um, Pony, where are you staying? Are you staying at your mother's house?
I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
So? What's L.A. like?
Like?
Hey, Pony, this is my friend Bee-Bee.
Yeah?
You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears it.
I'm moving.
Soon.
Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
Ooh, wow, nice. Personal trainer? Very nice.
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
Your manager?
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
Ew! Oh, Buff! Relax!
Buff is funny, okay? She likes Buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole.
Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore.
I can't believe your grandparents never come down here.
This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!
Holy shit.
And you know real cops aren't half as smart as Keanu.
Hello?
No.
But, we have to make a smart plan!
Like Cocoa Puffs.  Good.  Captain Crunch.  Bad.  Shreds the roof of your mouth.  I mean you hear, "Tricks are for kids!"  And you think, "I'm a kid, I guess they're for me."  But your baby brain's got no idea that Fruit Loops are, like, a million times better.  I'm going to save our kid all that pain.
I never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch.  Baby, we are living the great American Dream!
...so although their dad said, "Don't get out of the car until I get back with help," they knew the sheriff's voice as he yelled.  "Run to my voice - and don't look back."  The twins did as he said, but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient, bouncing their father's head on the top of the car!  Ah!  They jumped, Diane!  They jumped!
I'm sorry.
Kansas!
My daughter's always dreamed of bein' a cheerleader.  Put her on your squad and I'll give you the guns.
... Ja-ck B-ar-t-le-tt... Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?
And Hannah, you could give your share to your church - or maybe buy one of those hungry little kids Sally Struthers advertises.
Is that you down there?
Oh my G-d!  I'm not first!
Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl.  They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.
They could kill you.
My best friend got pregnant.
Kansas, I want you to meet someone special.
What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
Diane, it says here you're going to have mood swings, uncontrollable gas.
Good party.
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
Walking out on the mob.  What's the big idea?
Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.  On that Bases Loaded.  I covered it with a 2-page synopsis.  But I wouldn't bother.
It's from hunger.
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
You forgot this.
I've been hoping to run into you.
I had a teacher like that once.
I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?
With a wildly beating heart.
Hello, Artie.  Good evening, Miss Schaefer.
Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
What about all those ideas you had?
Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.
Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ...
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
I'm all tied up.  I can't.
What has Artie to do with it.
Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.
Sure.  Especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.
That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?
Why not? Don't you love Artie?
Ever been in one of these old Hollywood palazzos? That's from when they were making eighteen thou- sand a week, and no taxes.  Careful of these tiles, they're slippery. Valentino used to dance here.
Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
Goodbye, young fellow.  We'll see what we can do.
How much will it be?  I warn you - don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich.
Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.
How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
I don't know why you should be so upset.  Stop that playing, Max.  It seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together.
What scene?
Cut away from me?
Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.
Joe,  you look absolutely divine.  Turn around!
All padding.  Don't let it fool you.
Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
The other guests?
You think this is all very funny.
To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
Go away.  Go to that girl of yours.
How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.
No you didn't.  You took the car.
Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
Wanted what?
I just put my car in the garage. I had a blow-out.  I thought --
Look, maybe I'd better take my car --
I made your bed this afternoon.
I'm talking to you.  My clothes and things are up in the room.
Some men are here.  They asked for you.
How is she?
You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis? They used to be her dressing room, The whole row.
Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.
Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?
And she's turned you into a servant.
You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.
All right, Gillis.  You've got five minutes.  What's your story about?
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
How's that about your being my friend?
Forget Romanoff's.  It's the car I'm talking about.  If I lose my car it's like having my legs out off.
What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
This guy -- where did you meet him for the first time?  Where did he come from? Who is he?
Did the deceased ever threaten you? Were you in fear of bodily injury?
Paramount is calling.
I myself was surprised at Mr. de Mille's manners.
If you will pardon me, Madame. The shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced.
But the Power Source, Zaltar.
Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?
I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?
Why did she have to show up now?
What do I do?  I don't know her name.
I think I'd better keep it.
Sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
When can I see, you again ?
My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
Like it?
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
Let me kiss you.
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
She said it wouldn't last.
I don't love you any more.
That makes it worse.
Hi.
You think so?
But what if---it wasn't real?
Before you go...
You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.
No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks for my memoirs.
She's right. They'll string her up.
Nurse! Nurse!
Nurse!
If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again.
You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?
I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is.
Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?
Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second?
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
There isn't any.
Why is he acting so strangely?
I'm afraid I have some bad news about your car.
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
I just did. Because I have the Power.
Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as long as I don't go too far.
You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.
You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.
Where is inner space?
I was on Earth...
Are you happy, Zaltar?
But it's impossible.
Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
Yeah? What do you want?
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
Say, Brad. I think he'll be better off doing it his way.
Lana Lang. How great to see you.
You know what's the problem?
Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since --  I really can't remember when.
No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
Uh...excuse me, folks...
Well...  Not quite like this.
You're the best, Lois.
It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?
The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
Actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent.  There's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number.
Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!
Columbia.
Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
What?
Hey, boss.
And do nothing. Just sit there.
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
Yeah? How's it look?
You want to mess with Superman?
Hey, you're perfectly safe.
That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
Thank ...you.
And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
It's hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:
The picture looks blurry.
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems:
Oh, Superman!
Okay? Goodbye.
Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?
Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree?
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
Don't you see? Okay, so you didn't kill him. Nobody's perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all.  Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving...
Come on, let's give it a dry run.
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.
I do?
I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
Where were you?
Because of what I'm betting.  My life.
I want to.
You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.
Hi.
"They?"
See what happens when I don't have my orange juice?  The human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ----  . . . gee . . .
Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?
You'll have to pack quickly.
A parka.
Mush!  Mush!
You'll miss the battle of the century!
Well done, Miss Teschmacher.
This way Lex.
It has everything.
Why didn't you go before we left?
A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris
Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!
Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
Don't feel bad, Mr. Luthor. It almost worked. I mean California almost threw up right in the ocean. Millions of people almost killed. If it hadn't been for that guy Superman - that overgrown boyscout...
Superman! The --
So --  I hope you like it.
I never did this before . . . I have to tell you.
Hey, let's be fair. Actually, there've been two or three times --
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
Free!
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..
So this is the planet Houston . . .
This "super" man is nothing of the kind. I have discovered his weakness.
He...  cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .
It's brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You'll write a new series -- 'Metropolis After Hours.'
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
You're late. Very late.
I've never been in a place like this before.
My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?
Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.
Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield.
No Paris?
Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
'Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?'
Impossible? Why?
Awesome!
Not so fast!  All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent.
Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
Yes, darling?
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
Whoa. . .
Gee, Uncle Lex, I was just getting to the good part.
You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
Nifty, huh?  Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable  Now, destroy Superman.
Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?
Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
I'll deal with you later.
That the planet blew up on May 23, 1937. That the rocket ship with the revolting little freak in it took three years to reach Earth. Ergo?
You're a great architect, Albert.
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
It's very simple, Otis.  Very simple, the XK101 rocket. It's nothing, forty years ago we in the Fatherland were working on this. Five more years, we would've had it. But then  --  --  that silly war...Why, my cousin Werner had already  --
Me?
You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you?
Are there any more at home like you?
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
There's no real proof that tobacco  --
Can I take you to the airport?
Clark Kent, if you had only seen it the way I did, you -
There weren't any wires. I looked.
You're just jealous.
Oh, what a chance! If I could just  --  get to him.
Oh.
What can I tell you? He's my leader.
It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
Your father was a sick weirdo.
Nuts. He made it.
Shut up.
Some people can read 'War and Peace' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story. Other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe.  Y'know.
Mr. Romance...
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
Ready?
Don't let me down.
Two.
Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.
No! You couldn't imagine -
....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -
Who...who...
With my luck, now it'll rain.
Superman???
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
It must feel great.
Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
Well, gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake.
Sort of.
It's just that  --  I spent a fortune on these things!  And all for naught! What a waste  --
At the San Andreas Fault. Maybe you've heard of it.
Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!
We're...not together.
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.
I hope she gets better.
Case?
It just seems...kind of weird.
Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident.
I've tried to stay out of it.  But it turns out that's not so easy, Sam.  You've gone and got yourself this lawyer.  Mitchell Stephens. You and Risa and Wendell and the Ottos.
If that bastard does subpoena me, if he forces me to go over this again, then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing.
It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
She said she's got to be home by nine.
Have you been waiting long?
Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
Because I have to.
Why did you do that, Billy?
Dolores.  No one calls me 'Mrs. Driscoll'.
No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
That's the way I thought of them sometimes.
A strange little fellow, but you couldn't help liking him.  He was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six.
I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.
He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole.  He looked frightened.
What do you think?
You hate it.
It's for the school bazaar.
But Dolores said she saw a dog and tried to...
We've only got honey.
What happened to summer?
Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey?  Want me to fix you something?
That was Billy Ansel on the phone. He wants to come over to talk to us.
Is he coming over now?  Right away?
The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty...
What's vermin again?
That's right.
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
Yes.
Why?
When?
They're smart.  Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago.
You always think you're prepared for these things.
The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.
Yes, I'll accept the charges.
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
Do you have the blood test?
I can hear you breathing, Daddy.
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
We do.
I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.
It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger.  Not their grief.
Dolores?
Are you expensive?
Kyle Lambston's a drunk.  Nobody likes him.  He's a nasty piece of work.
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.
No.  I was alone.  My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.
Yes.
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
No.
This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going?  To the best of your recollection?
You saw the speedometer?
Of course.
What's so funny?
What took so long?
Pretty slick, eh?
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
Partly.  But there's a lot the insurance doesn't cover.  That's one of the reasons we have a lawyer.  To make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest.
What do you mean?
What's going to happen to Dolores?
He's somewhere...
Come on boys, break it up...
...People catch on quick to such an item.  Van Cleve already called me - he's firing the quintet.
I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...
Does he have to be here in our hair?
Just exactly what are you so hot about?  I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but --
Susie, as always, is free to say anything she thinks.  Go on, dear, say exactly what's on your mind, dear.
But my day with Susie isn't over yet and--
Why are you trembling, dear...?
You know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and I, and I don't like that.
There is some allusion here that escapes me...
Can I come out?  No.
I'll do it, J.J. - don't get me wrong - in for a penny, in for a pound.  I'll see it through, but stop beating me around the head. Let me make a living!
I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
Are you listening?
J.J., it's one thing to wear your dog collar...but when it gets to be a noose...I'd rather have my freedom.
Sidney, I told you -
Who put this item in about the comic?  "If there's a more hilarious funny man around than Herbie Temple at the Palace, you'll have to pardon us for not catching the name.  We were too busy screaming." Does this Temple have a press agent?
You were thrilled to be interviewed.  Were you "interviewed"?
Do you think you could do something, Sidney?
Yeah!
Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I?  A bowl of fruit?  A tangerine that peels in a minute?
A girl needs a little romancing before she -
That's the third time he's called today.
No, an arm, he said.  I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...
Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.
You ought to be used to me by now.
What's the matter?
I swear, Sidney, I can't help it - sometimes I wonder what I see in you...
It's a habit with me.  So now I'm briefed.  So what?
You're talking very fast.
Yeah!  Like me!  I don't choke on my own gall - I fight back!  Let THEM choke, not me!
Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can promise you -
Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you...  Will you forgive me?  Have I lost you, Steve?  Have I...?
Please... let... the kids... go...
We should abort.
Do you have bandages?
Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean... whoah!  You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?
What does that mean?
You have to do what I say?!
Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!
Swear.
How long do you live?  I mean, last?
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
I'll deal with the police.
No!
Easy money!
Out of the way, John!
It, John.  Not him.  It.
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
Ready to rock?
John, get out of the way!!
You broke my arm!
You're already dead, Silberman.  Everybody here dies.  You know I believe that.  So don't fuck with me!
You look like handmade shit.
I must be destroyed.
Is it safe for them here?
And no elbows on the table!
Don't see me to my door, there's no need.
I'm very sorry.
I guess so, sir.
I guess you admire musicians.
What the hell are they doing?
David, need to ask you something. You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive?
Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes.
Isn't it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductor's baton, isn't that true?
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
And suddenly, Steve, suddenly you notice that they like you. They honour you, suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world, for example.
You live here, in Berlin?
I want you to understand why you're here. You're automatically banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24. We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission. You understand that?
Or maybe you called Goebbels or Goering? You were so close you were in the same shithouse as them.
Von der Null?
That's an outrageous lie!
He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
I have no idea.
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party.
I hear the British have his... his archive, files, records.
Show me.
Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.
Was looking at Furtwängler like that?
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
Rudolf Otto Werner. Wind section since 1936. What instrument did you play?
Can you handle it?
Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be?
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.
Do you understand?
But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs.
Pay attention.  The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.  But these are new.  They look human.  Sweat, bad breath, everything.  Very hard to spot.  I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him.
So, it's from the future, is that right?
And you're from the future too?
Just let me go.
You volunteered?
Good field-dressing.
Bag some Z's?
Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
Hot dogs?
My whole life has been combat.
Not possible.
Don't say that.
Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
I bet you're ticklish.
What are you doing?
Sarah.
What are you doing?
So.  You're a soldier. Fighting for whom?
I didn't build the fucking thing.
Why were the other two women killed?
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.
Send a unit.
You're talking tomorrow.  Today is what counts.
What?
I could fight you on this.
Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
Pardon me... Miss... ?
Excuse me, I need to explain...
This can't be real...
It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
Where'd you all go?  Motherfucking frat boys.  You better hide.  Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?
This is C.R.S.
I know the owner of Campton Place.  I could talk to him in the morning.
I have a confession to make.  Someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you, as a practical joke.
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.
Okay.
Take the picture out.
What are you doing... ?
I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead...
You can talk while I drive us to the police.
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.
I don't know.  A lot.
What do you think you're doing?
Guess you missed it.
Listen very carefully, I'm telling the truth... this is the game.  This was all the game.
Think about it!  They followed you every step of the way.  There was always a safety net.  The taxi, there was a diver.  At my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...
I didn't know what else to call you.
Yes.
I redecorated.  What about you?
You need anything?
For you.
Tell me you'll call.
But, will you?
How do you mean, exactly?
What have they been doing to you?
How do you know?
How did those... ?
Where's Christine?  The waitress.
No money, no identification or passport.  You are in a fix.  What did happen to you?
The last few days, um... I've been thinking... had a lot of spare time.  I want to tell you... I'm starting to understand why you left me.  I've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... I want to apologize, for all of it.  For shutting you out, for not being there.  I...  Anyway, I hope you can forgive me.
I'll explain someday.
Your brother was a client with our London branch.  We do a sort of informal scoring.  His numbers were outstanding.  Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...
It's different every time.
Physical?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Where?
Guess!
I've been so lonely.
Ah, Mr. Van Orton.  Here you go...
I'll send your regrets.  Honestly, why must I even bother?
Hey... !
Anything wrong... ?
I wasn't expecting you.
Attractive...
Nicholas...
Someone's playing hardball.  It's complicated.  Can I ask a favor?
Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely, don't thank me.
You know what I love about wine that comes in bottles like this?
I only saw Theo drive up.
Couldn't get the last ones.  You?
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.
Is that the question of compassion or science?
You're not telling us something.
Well, this lot is full!
So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
Yeah.
No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
All right...
What happened after you smelled it?
Are you coming to confess?
Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...
You hear the vibrations in the wire.  There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it.  I could test it.
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.
Here's how they're organized. Groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the Kiersey Temperament Sorter just like you asked for.  And they all score high on the insomnia charts.
Why?
They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?
No one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper.
You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?
Good night, Theo.
Watts?
David?
Theo... Did you?
That's so sad.
I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.
I'll take that as a compliment.  In the city, what kind of place do you live in?
Nell, what happened?
This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!
I'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep.  And then I'm going to get some brandy.
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
We think someone is here.
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.
Oh really?  Where you from?
That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
What, tryin' to catch him with another bird?
You're kiddin' me, right?
Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man?  Do the background check?  Go through a three-day waiting period?
No.  Not at all.  Do we?
Now what.  You gonna take your new arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just like that?  Boom bam boom.
I've been wondering something.
Didn't get it.
Had a feeling it was you.
Why did you come here?
What was that, then?
When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it?
I bet.
So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.
On what.  What makes you so certain.
How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you.  Among her things.
You don't seem bothered.
What did you do?  To make them take the early 70's away from you.
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
Who remembers.
I don't believe it.
I guess you're just habitual.
Won't he be looking for you about now?
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
She used to tell me she'd turn me in.  Little kid.  Ten year old.  "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya."  She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job.  "I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now" -- picking up the telephone.  I can see her, the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke.
Where's Big Sur?
Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.
It was you.  Downtown.
He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
Where is he now?
Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  Wow.
I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.
What d'you mean, any happier?
What's in it?
How we gonna get that lucky?
You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.
Is Valentine here?
Where is he, then?
I miss my kids.
It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.
Tell you ...
Ann--
He was deaf when he wrote this.
...or maybe I just haven't played 'em right, I don't know. But you're--
Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away.
That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.
You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--
...I guess I've been all wet.
I speak to you on ze phone, non? You have a special interest in music?
Ah yes, a music lover.
Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.
A goose, friend. I was chasing a wild goose. Ed, have you ever heard of venture capital?
Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!
...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?
I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
You got the dough?!
All right.
How ya doin', Ed?
...That's quite a wife you got there.
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
How much to they want, Dave?
That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.
Your place?
Where you going?
Look, I don't wanna waste your time so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind? *You* don't mind. So while I'm in town I'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. We'll talk about appeals if, as and when. For right now, has she confessed?
--don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.
...I don't get it.
Yeah.
...Did Big Dave mention that it was something about his war service? I don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll* have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; I'm not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did* serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores, and who made a fool out of this entire town, turns to *you* to help him out of his jam. Fat-assed sonofabitch!
...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
...Probity.
Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here.
I don't work here. My wife does.
...Ed?
...so you tie your own flies, Ed. I mean, if you're really serious. You tie your own flies, you do a--I know it's matickless, I know, people say, hey, you can buy flies at the store-- but you can buy your fish at the store, Ed, you see what I'm saying?
The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
...You sure, Eddie?
They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that.
...We goin'?
I don't understand.
Hello!
Doesn't bother me.
He's a barber.
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
His eyes are open.
Don't know if it'll do any good, Mr. Cuthbert.
Behind you.
In every exhibition room.  The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five.  We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?
Lieutenant --
Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago?  Twelve bodies on board.
Yes.  That's my case.  Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated.  Brains extracted.  Limbs torn to shreds.  It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.
What happened to them?
Pendergast!  Help!  It's right behind us!
Look.  It's some kind of letter.
Lieutenant!  It's me.
What's that doing here?
We've met.  The Hacksaw Murders.  '89.
With all due respect, dear, that's bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  You've left me in the dust.
This isn't a death sentence.  Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.
All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw.  "Species unidentified.  Genus: unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male, weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain capacity, 900 centimeters." That means it's highly intelligent. "Quadrupedal."
"Nocturnal.  External hair and bony plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight.  "External mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "Morphological characteristics: Highly robust.  Aggressiveness: extreme."
Dr. Frock?
You said John Whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum.
Margo, this is too dangerous.  You always think you can solve everything.  This time you don't have enough information.  The animal might behave in unexpected ways.  Leave her here with me.  Don't put her in danger.
You work here?
Quiet!
We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
Look.  It's Hobbes!  He's all right.
Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!
Is Dr. Frock safe!
How does it work?
Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
Where would we find it?
That's not what I saw.
Dr. Green...
Wounded?
That was D'Agosta.
It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean?
For what?
Help someone!
We're not going to make the storage room!
He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot.  Call him, Margo.
Viti Levu.  For how many?
You want to book the flight?
Why wasn't I told?  Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported.  Is that the best shot we can get?
What happened down there?
I'm sure we'll get him on this next sweep.
Welcome.
Of course, there hasn't been anything to compare with this - the first time an intruder has been a former cast member--
I understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show.  How did you convince him--was it the opportunity to be close to Truman again?
How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?
But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?
Not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he gives us a glimpse of ourselves.
We should remind viewers that Truman, especially as a child, presented a challenge for the production.
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--
Why do you feel that Truman's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world?
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
The creator of what?
What's he doing?
How can they have a child?
Well, what do you want to do?
It's beautiful!  What are you waiting for?
I figured, what's the point?  I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me.  Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes.  I realized, what the hell could be better than this?  I'm telling you.  What you really need is someone to carry on the "Burbank" name.
I think I'm mixed up in something.
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
I went all over but I never found a place like this.  Look at that sunset, Truman.  It's perfect.
Hi, honey.  Look at this.  It's a "Chef's-Mate."  Dicer, slicer and peeler in one.  Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.
How did it go today?
This'll pass.  Everybody thinks like this now and then.  Come to bed.
I know.
What did you want?
Come on, Truman.  Haven't you studied enough?
I'll take you home, Angela.  Why don't you leave those with us for a while?
--we need more charcoal.
Why don't I make you some of this new Mococoa Drink?  All natural.  Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners--
What the hell has that got to do with anything?  Tell me what's happening?!
You look very pale, Truman.  Are you taking your vitamin D's?
I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important.
Is there any way around?
Do you live around here?
They gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. But you've been unconscious since they brought you in.
Special Agent Scully --
-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
You've got something to show me.
We brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we've ever seen.
And if it's unsuccessful?
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
You looking for him for some other reason?
I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found.
How's that?
The Federal Building was too well guarded.
I'll know soon enough.
You told me you had answers.
You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you.
I'm on the roof.
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
...thirteen fifty six...
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
What? What are you talking about?
You're... quitting?
Are you drunk, Mulder?
It's like jelly.
What kind of infection?
You said you weren't coming?
What are my choices?
What?
Yeah, well they may this one.
This virus -- it... 
This is weird, Mulder.
Scully...
On whose orders?
Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.
She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
Where's Scully?
I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed.
A virus?
Why are you telling me this?
We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive.
My god...
Sing a song of sixpence...
She adores you.
Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about.  Want to come?
Sing a song of sixpence.
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
Agent Novak?
Why'd you bring him here?
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
Evil.
What happened?
Well look at that.
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
That's why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely.  We don't want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.
When did he lapse into the coma?
Into Stargher.  Inside...
I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?
Is she alright?
What about the cat?
I need it.
The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match.
After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
But I could follow it fine. Perhaps Harry told you about me. My name's Holly Martins.
No.
He said he remembered me too. Seems to show he wasn't in much pain.
...at all.
Why?
Harry?
The Porter is going to talk to us tonight.
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?
When...what did you do?
That's Harry's place, isn't it?
Wer ist da?
I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?
Oh, well.
...anyway?
Good evening, Miss Schmidt. You remember me?
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.
Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt, he can't get away.
We are interested in this case. Have you arrested the girl?
Please keep this passport to yourself, until I make some inquiries, will you, Major?
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you? You could do with a drink.
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
Get the next plane.
Next, Paine.
So would I.
...a week ago.
I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
It wouldn't work.
Write her out a receipt, Paine. Give her a receipt for these letters too.
...excuse me.
Do you know his number?
...his number.
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.
Zane Grey.
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...
Hmm.
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
Did the police believe you?
What do you want me to do?
I'm only safe in the Russian Zone... I'm safe as long as they can use me...
You told them, didn't you?
Have you ever seen any of your victims?
...this way.
We came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. A friend of his called to him from over there. Harry went across and from up there came the truck. It was just about here.
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
Not yet.
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Sehen sie da gleich da unter. Da unten ist est passiert. Passiert - English.
Oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
Kurtz.
Something wrong.
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?
What else did he tell you?
No.
Where are you staying?
Lime.  Harry Lime.
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you.
It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to.
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her.
One kilometer
Exactly.
That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them.
Too far?
They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
Read the early Zionists on European Jewry; they sound like Goebbels.
Fucking Danny, man...
That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.
What do you think you're doing?
This? This is a joke.  I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
Which is what?
"...<i>und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze</i>..."
Are they still together?
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.
Where'd you get this?
Va-yomer... And he said.  It goes the other way.
Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha...
Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
Payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem...
What's it about?
Nazis talk about it all the time.
The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked about Jews incessantly.... You ever read their diaries?...
You can't. Do you know how many people I've brought into...the movement...?
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
Who's Eichmann?
Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.
...Insulting people who were in the camps. ...What's the point?
Curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker.
You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
How do you reconcile the two?
Why did you come tonight? To see me?
Think about your father. Your sister.
You shut up. Who do you think you are?
What part of Germany are you people from?
What is happening?
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
What are you doing here?
Tell it to Hitler.
The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?
Hello...?
I'm doing a piece on right-wing groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear you're an important figure in those circles. You have a lot of interesting ideas....
What is it?
Didn't you get anything?
They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
It's not going to be fine. It's --
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.
You can't say that....
Where do you think you're going?
It's Friday....
We want you to help run it. Give speeches, lead seminars... Handle the fund-raising.
Do you have a suit?  Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too.  And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you?
So what?
Are you out of your mind?!
In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?
You're going to live here permanently?
You're leaving?
Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.
My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.
What's happened??
This is a great pleasure.
And just where are you from?
... It's a comfortable place.
Jacques!  Johana!
Checking out the competition.
You risk your life when you cross the street.
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
How did it happen?
Ten thousand.
In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.
Plenty of women everywhere right?
It isn't lit yet.
... What's your name again?
Is that alcohol?  Are you out of your mind?  Alcohol is strictly forbidden.
That's good.  You never would have recognized me, huh?  Check out the suit! Looking good, no?  You know I'm the world champion?
Enzo?
C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight.  We have a new world champion.
Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.
What?
You still collect them?
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
In the lake?
No, no.  You'll like it.  It's superb.
No.  I want to show you.  Is it ruined?
She's not like the others.  She can't stand to be away from the sea.
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
Well, then, talk to me some more.
Then, tell me a story.
Do you know how it is?  Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?
Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.
What?
You want to lie down for a while?
In my apartment?
... And if we repaint the walls, we'll need new curtains, you put the painters on you Visa and I'll do the curtains on American Express... for the couch there's Bloomingdales...  or are you still over your limit?
He's in the fluoroscope now.  Listen to his heart.  Impressive, huh? The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore.  It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.
Will he understand Spanish?
You've made me a happy insurance person.
Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
Looks like I got a plane to catch.
Well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL.
From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times...
Oy vey, I'm stuffed.
That got annoying fairly quickly.
So, now what?
Want to get a drink?
...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.
...and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels, and light the menorah with the knowl...
How do we bypass it?
So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?
What should I charge?
You okay?
Get off of me you cripple!
What day is it?
When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.
Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.
Mmm———yes.
Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
I'm sick.
I don't know. I want to see Robles.
I want him to lock me up.
I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl.
It's about the leopard.
That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
Why?
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
Charlie doesn't think the leopard killed the girl in the cemetery.
It could be a man.
There are all sorts of men. You get to see some funny ones as a reporter.
We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that?
To the eye? Like other men.
It was you, Galbraith!
Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
You can go now, Manning. There is no way we can hold you legally responsible.
I haven't done any posse work since last time I rode with Toni Mix at the old Bijou Theatre -- aged six, If you're interested,
That's easy. Me.
Get it out of here!
This is l939. Can't you subtract?
You look swell in that three—alarm number --
Are you all right?
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
And she waited here for him?
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
I got into a little crap game.
All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways —
Kiki?
All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
De Moraes? I was asked here by a Mrs Spitz.
You seem surprised. Could it be you don’t think that badly of him after all?  You needn’t worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.
Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?
Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes...
Black suits you.
How... When did you...
To get me killed...?
Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brother’s not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will...
The staff don’t know yet...  I called my parents, told them everything...  I just couldn’t take any more...
There’s nothing wrong with the line, sir. Are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is the number of a call box.
You wouldn’t have a cigarette, would you?
You’re sure you won’t sit down, Miss Stewart?
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassy’s out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
Friedman’s dead... They killed him...
Hi...
How much of a hurry are you in?
Ever seen him before?
Where?
There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where are the other five?
What about the staff?  They’re in on what’s going on, aren’t they?  How many of them?
You sure you passed on my message?
She’s pretty... See you, huh?
No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be.  Maybe it’s there with...
Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say you’re my secretary, all right?
Carlos De Moraes?
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
I take it your son is called Leon?
The £1,000 is on account.
I’m overcome by your public-spiritedness.
I gather we’ve done business with a friend of yours?
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
Leon? No. I’m afraid he left.
What’s a French private investigator doing here?
...Leon’s not here. How did you get here? Phil doesn’t know where I live.
What’s the date?
Huh... I guess you ain’t quite ready for civilisation yet... I’ll give you one more day, a meal, and then you’re on your way.
What’s an hour of your time worth these days, Nathalie?  Combien, Nathalie!
Gluck.
So why didn’t he?
I think you’d rather not know what I think.
Moreau? C’est moi. Alors...
Ha ha... Yes. With prices reaching an all time low, the name of the game has become ‘have-it- where-it’s-at’... As we all know, transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business...
Costliest!
My dear Aulon...  That's fine...
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
What do you fear most now... my sword?  ... or his hands?
Listen, please accept my apologies for... you know, me pretending to be the... well it wasn't really my idea... well, yes it was my idea but...
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
Better today than tomorrow.
Jeanne, stop it!
He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!
Good.
Not so... easily.  Why aren't you... fighting...?  go on... we're almost there...
Alright... I promise to rest if you promise... to go back to the battle.
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
To be killed in battle?
Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!
Do as I say!
... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even...  ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!
Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?
Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
No!  I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?
It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size.  Am I correct, Bishop?
But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...
Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is.  This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
Whose side are you on, Cauchon?
Oh, thank you Lord!  I'm so glad to see you!  I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now?
The English??
How old are you?
Were you baptized?
It is for us to determine whether you are a good Christian, not you.
Sign this, and I will confess you myself if you want.
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
... and what... what did he say?
I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
Not exactly.  She wants you to give her an army -- at your expanse.  Bearing in mind that your mother stole every last piece of gold in the treasury, I fail to see how you can afford such an adventure.
Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman.  It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!
He's probably right -- let's call a delay...
When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
Does he have hair?
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
Good.  Can you bring me to him?
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
So... what is the message?
You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.
Jeanne, what are you doing with that... you've got it back to front...
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!
The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
Clear?
Jeanne... let him do it.  One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?
Jeanne... we're not enough...
Do you know how to count?
But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!
I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life!  But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...
Prepare these as battering-rams!
We... won?!
Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll stay standing... this armor... it's a nightmare to get back up...
Jeanne... what are you doing?
Who... who are you...?
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
That's too easy.  One minute you want to die, the next you want to live...  Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?
God asked you to do something?
I'm not lying, I... I can't remember... leave me alone!
Stop, stop... I can't remember!  The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...
"Let all who love me follow me"... Where does God get mentioned?  Come on Jeanne, be honest.  You fought for yourself, in your name.
My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
You think you are ready now?
But you already confessed this morning...
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent him.
Hello.
Who are you?
Really?
Dorota!
Don't worry, it won't last long.
When's your baby due?
Must feel better this side of the wall.
I'm on the run!
The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
Henryk's in there.
I've no money.
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
We're recruiting.
Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
Henryk, I said nothing bad.
They bombed us, we're off the air.
Mama, that was a great dinner.
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this.  In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.
A good place for what?  He's insane!
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
What's that mean, no employment certificate?
But I want to help, I want to.
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
I'm not, but Majorek is.
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
Pig!
I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more.  But.
Out of Warsaw.
What's your work?
What about you?
Szpilman.
Watch your feet!
Careful! Watch his hand.
Oh, yes, yes of course, a concern.
Don't answer, he low born. Jun look at him, mongrel. Your wife where she?
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.
She looks tired.
They want more money. They are trying to make two days out of it?
I don't think you should have given up the piano. I will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on to sheets and...
Has Ada ever spoken to you?
Everyone has to practice.
What's in here then, lead?
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.
Mama.
You the owner here?
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
Nobody.  I just know what kinda women he likes.  I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him.
7 to 2.  That ain't bad.
You wanted by the law or somethin'?
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
I'm out, Johnny.
Wasn't no problem a mine.
Mottola.
We got word from Chicago.  They got one of the grifters last night. The nigger.
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set it up for threes and nines.  I'll cut it in on his deal.
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
Aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side.
You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money.  And no matter how much you take from his, he'll get more.
He's waitin' for you in the card room.
How'd ya do?
No signs of trouble?
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
Henry.
You wanta wait for your share?
All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool.
Raise 300.
She coulda killed me last night.
I'll tell ya what you did, smart boy.  You tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from Maxies.  You and Coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it woulda been perfect.
Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan. He'll swat you like any fly.
My end was only one.
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?
I, ah...thought you might wanna come out for a while.  Maybe have a drink or somethin'.
Ain't seen you in months, boy. Thought maybe you took a fall.
You're dreamin', kid.
You got the 400 grand yet?
A week's a long time, friend. Anything can happen.  All of it bad.
Will you wait until the chump is played?
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
Take it easy.  Everything's all right.  I put it on Syphon, on the nose.
You weren't hired to miss him.
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
What is this?  I got work to do.
There's word he's gonna run a con on the North Side here.  We got a year-old Florida warrant on him, but it's a thin beef, and he can beat it in court unless we catch him cold.  All we want you to do is pick up Hooker for us.
Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  But it's not gonna happen this time.  We're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it.
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.
He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.
She's got me worrying, too.
Well!
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
How are you?....  Oh, I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now....  No, she isn't here.  Is it about her father?  Well, can I take the message?
What is it?
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
Don't.  It's horrible.
He didn't do it -- Nick!
How did you ever remember me?
You heard about Julia Wolf?
Yes.  I hated her for coming between my mother and father.  She kept me from seeing my father.  I went down there to ask her where he was.  She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.
She fell down.
Dead?
Wait a minute.  When is it going to be? I'm leaving town tonight.
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
How's your brother?
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
Did they find any clues...  a gun or fingerprints or anything?
Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
Ask him.  I don't know.
This gun yours?
You oughtn't to play this trick on me.  Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.
What about the suicide?
You've been there?
What about this Nunheim?
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
I said he hadn't written me.
He telephoned me today.
About three.
Where were you?
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
Who's that man?
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
I never had it.
Oh, please, Nick.
How are you?
Nothing, thank you.  Nothing.  I wanted to see you...  What's Mimi up to, Charles?
Oh, Nick... Nick!
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
I thought so.  He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
Come on -- relax --  Give them a drink.
Where did you get that?
What are you going to do with it?
Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?
Everybody says you were a grand detective.
What are you going to give me?  I hope I don't like it.
There's one coming.
Is that another Christmas present?
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Oh, it's a fire hydrant.
Sit down!
Nick!
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
Yes!
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
I can't wait any longer.  Tell me, do you think one of them did it?
Is that true?
Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
I'm sorry.  Tanner, don't you want some wine?
Turn the car around.
Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.
Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is.
What are we going to do!?
Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But if we do it, we do it right.  I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.
What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
Ready?
Not much of a pass.
And they can't fly around out there forever.
You're the one with all the ideas.
I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold.  Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.
At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.
At-at-at-at-at.
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
What!?  What!?
You think?
They finally start the ground war, and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.
Don't even.  You're not going to show me that tired map.
I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
Now this is war.
Invest it.
Take the binoculars.
Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
She okay?
Oh, God!  Oh God!
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
You don't know that.  It could be a trick.
You're not losing trust, are you?
Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
They're doing more than slapping.
Not enough.  We're out numbered and out gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.
X marks the spot.
But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
It looks like you're not doing anything.
Get up and dig.
Wait.
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?
We can't just leave him.
They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
What do you think our chances are?
Getting cold.
Well?
Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war.  They don't want any trouble.
What did you say?
And then shoot them.
Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!
Is that good, or bad?
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
We can't just sit here waiting to die.
I didn't say that.  I never said--
It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
Australia.
He's not slowing.
Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
Could you stop, please.  You're giving me a headache.
What is this?
They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--
Jaeger?
You ever think about it?  You ever worry?
The longer the air force hits the Iraqis, the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage.
That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.
God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't.
If there's gold.  If!
Iraqis.
We have to go back.
Really?  What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
Is there anything you do know?
So?
Hurry up.
Control ON.
4000 degrees is usually the point of....?
No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
When?
I've never been under the table before.
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
Now...now, I'm sorry...don't - don't....please.  It's just... I was happy.  Why get me involved? You told SEN that you weren't satisfied with me.
I said what time is it?  How long was I out?
Three!  I'm going to be late for my shift.
What are you doing here?  Is anything wrong?
Are you all right?
It's the end.
But we need a creative dissent. Our voices are not joined in any harmonious chorus, but the differences are differences of emphasis, not of fundamentals. Now, the new alignment's greatest need is to communicate with all its elements, rather than march along in parallel line that never converge.  Tomorrow as we focus the new movement more clearly, we will gain a new unity.
I thought you were through with it!
He's coming back for the rest of us.  He can't make it alone.
I'm sure it's warmer in her than outside, though.  I haven't been out yet, but it usually is...the control is fouled... 
I won't have another mate like ONA.  You rate very high in sanitation.  I've checked.  In fact, I am surprised that you were ever matched with LUH.  Her ratings are very erratic - you know what I mean.  We'll be happy.
What?
We've lost SEN!
What was that....
Would you like part of this? ....It's not much.
You don't know that!
Just look at all those people.
Yes
....with me?  What am I to her or she to me?  Nothing.  She's an ordinary roommate.  I..I share...
May I help you?
f 2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But, I-
How's the print coming?
Dispatch, this is Reilly.
Nitro-cellulose. What is that, some kind of explosive?
How long were you hooked?
Should we head for the Interstate?
No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...
Glass, Eighth Street, alley behind Grand Hotel. Cut him off.
What's wrong?
Assist? What the hell you know about tickers anyway?
What do you think?
You got it.
Political.
No, we're terrorists, stay back or we'll blow.
Lane oil...
What do ay say?
Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.
There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.
What is that?
Alex, please.
Who are you calling, sis?
I'm filing charges against that mother-
Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ...
That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.
Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.
Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
Sir...
It's our only option.
Yes.
M'sieu Giron is downstairs.
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
No!
What did you talk about?
<u>Tonsili!</u>
I wanted to say goodbye to you.
But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
Yes!
You know, I'm not the marrying type. I like to take my fun and leave it.
I would start with cocktails.
I want to see that moon in the champagne.
I don't want to see you at all!
Then why didn't you call the police? Why <u>don't</u> you call the police?  I'll tell you why--you crook, you.
Thank you, Major. 
Who?
Please.
Darling, then let's be honest and return it to the lady.
We'll go to Venice, to the same hotel!
You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!
Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here!  I don't like this place!
No--not yet--but--  Two tickets to Berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... Right ... Right ... Leave them in the name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... Right ... Thank you. 
Correct. Now the train leaves--
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
And you--
Yes...?
And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
Do you know my first name?
Make it out to cash!
Beautiful specimen.
Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father--  which, fortunately, I am not--
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
Yes, madame?
Marvelous.
You have been robbed--for years. And not a hundred thousand francs, but millions. And you know who did it? Adolph.
Why not? He's a thief--he's a criminal.
It could have been marvelous ...
Lovely.
Oh, M'sieu Laval ...
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
Well, in times like these most people are cutting salaries, but suppose we say, in your case, three hundred and fifty?
I think you'd better go.
You should have more self-control. You were in the army.
No--I'm sorry.
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.
You told me to change.
Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
Something serious has happened.
Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.
How you two doin'?
The suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going.
I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your men back there! We got plenty a' room for more.
Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
Ever been to Wisconsin?
I'm Jack Dawson.
Hello again.
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella.
It is that simple.
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
And...?
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.
Are you nervous?
Looks okay. I don't see anything.
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
It's getting quiet.
You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise.
Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?
Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course.  Isn't that right, sweetie.
I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...
Don't come any closer.
Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone!
I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley, and it will insure our survival.
Anya, I think you're crazy.
Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
Isn't she lovely?
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
You'll excuse me. 
Will you pardon me?
You're lucky--out my way, in Montana, there's nothing else to do--
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.
I'm so sorry!
Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.
Married?
Yes?
Sooner it you like.
Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.
Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
This time I'm really glad you showed up.
What?--
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
I could see you were pining away--
Who with?
You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself!
I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.
A dollar forty.
Here's your twenty-five hundred, Mr. Brett.
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
You keep it-- 
Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
Come in! 
Three Jacks.
I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett.
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
Wouldn't bet against her.  Tell you what I will do--bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France.  Not a hundred, though--just fifty.
Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you-- 
She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
I won't--I'll ask for one right now.  Sally tells me she's in love with you.
Where do you live?
Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out.  "Back in four weeks." Instead of "in four weeks"--say "next month"--That saves another word.
Now we get it down to two words--"next month."
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
That's me!
Yes--Me--in person!
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
Am I a member of this club?
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
Yes.
I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
Well, let's hear the poem--
Is that one of the Who's Who?
Can you read 'em Jack?
The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but--
He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got to win that fifty bucks.
He's certainly good-natured.
Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!
I'm all right.
I was in his cabin--
I tell yuh I ain't got no bracelet--
I said that's 500 to you, Holliday.  In or out?
So how's Tombstone treating you?
What d'you think of the singer?
He said to turn loose of him.
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
Let me, let me, yeah!  Die, you Bastard...
Forget it.
I said forget it, answer's no, I Don't want the job and that's Final.  I'm going to Tombstone and Nothin' short of dyin's gonn Stop me.  Good day.
Not me.  I'm in my prime.
That's just my game.
Here, Doc.
I calculate that's the end of This town.  And let's don't bother About the luggage, darling.
What's wrong, Doc?
Not exactly...
Very cosmopolitan.
So tell me, Wyatt.  I'm curious. Do you actually consider youself A married man?  Forsaking all Others?
I don't know.  Probably ignore her.
Satisfied?
Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.
Well hell, Wyatt.  Wyatt, I want You to meet Father Feeney.  Father Feeney's just been initiating me Into the mysteries of the great And ancient Church of Rome.  You See, it appears my hypocrisy Knows no bounds.
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative.
Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five Thousand!  Let's go!
Hello, Wyatt!  Hiya Doc!
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason.
We've never actually met.  My Name's-
Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife?
I hate Sadie.
So I assume we're regarding this As just a kind of interlude.
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.
No, no, get away, get away from me...
Those Cowboys're tellin' Everybody in town they're gonna Clean you out.  They're down in That lot right now behind the OK Corral.
Oh, all right.
Well, I was thinking, we've Already made a pile of money. Maybe we should just pull up Stakes and move on.  And we could Stay on the move, you know?  Just Keep going, see the world.  Live On room service the rest of our Lives.  How'd that be?
All right, look.  I can make it Right, I can make this up to you, Mattie.  I can, I swear.
Yeah, kinda, wanted to see if you'd join back up with us.
Next waterhole's Black Draw.  We Could be there by mid-morning.
There they are.  No herd though.
Give him some good exercise?  Sure Some stud.  Some string in fact. What're you gonna do, race 'em?
Listen to me, both of you.  This Is no good.  This is trouble we Don't need.  For the first time in Our lives we got a chance to stop Wandering and finally be a Family.  Do this and you throw it All away.  You saw what happened To Fred White.
What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.
That a fact?
Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served.  That means we got the Cowboys without quarter.  The Black flag, brother.  No Prisoners, no mercy, amen.
We should get moving.
Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest.
You'll never make that stick.
See what I mean about it getting Spooky?
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
It's too late -
At least we know where the gold is. When are the recovery ships due?
By the way - what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond?
4:30. It may take me a little longer to wrap things up here.
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
Your new car. 
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
Yes -
Wait a minute -
Oh, James. I've missed you -
There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He's also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every consideration.
Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?
It must do something.
... Shoelaces?
Wade, what the hell are you doing here?
Natalya?
Where to now, Jimbo?
Interesting presentation.
... Does this do anything?
Boyfriend?
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
- Shut up!
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
This has got to be a mistake.
Wait here.
Not a lot of difference.
What the hell does that do?
Sometimes you just have to -
Another reason??? Did I miss something???
If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.
... Yes?
And when might that be?
- Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. -
The reason I invited the Minister here, 007, was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion.
You're to wear this mask at the Venice Carnival, and wait to be contacted.
...You're turning into quite the politician, 007.
The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.
... And what do you call these?
Sakwa!
What's your name?
I was an attorney!
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
How is it now?
It's a trick! After him.  They're in the south stairwell!
They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!
- Built to withstand a nuclear blast.  Are they alive?
Why, you don't want us to bring him over?
You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.
I'm leaving and don't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life. I'm tired of people saying Babe Brother this, Babe Brother that. What's my name?
I'm cold. I need to get out into the sunlight.
You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean.
Why does he always pick on me?
I have more sense than to give up everything, my family, you and Sunny. It wasn't me, I mean the real me inside my body. I'm glad it's over. It's like a veil has been lifted.
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
Who is it?
I'm going back home with Harry.
I'm busy.
Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be.
What is that?
Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything?
Well, you just have to move further out.
Let us settle this tomorrow.
I'm worn out.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
It's good to be able to hear that.
How is the garden doing?
I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
It's the boy next door throwing at his birds. I'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window
Good morning.
How often is your wife called to help delivery?
Stranger my foot, it was my grandmother who helped you into this world.
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman.
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
A woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days.
I couldn't believe it when Suzie called and said you were staying here. How have you been?
Harry, that's not nice. I'm in church now.
Is this your house?
All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
You know Harry lied about how that boy Hocker got kilt. And it was Harry who saw Emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog.
What are you doing?
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
To infinity and beyond!
Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
Everybody say, "Bye, house."
Hey!  Wow!
Woody!  Buzz!
Here!  In the car!
Which one can I open first?
Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!  There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
Don't even think about it, cowboy!
You actually think you're THE "Buzz Lightyear?" Oh, all this time I thought it was an act!  Hey, guys!  Look!  It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear!
What's going on?
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
THAT is Sid!
Buzz!!  Oh, Buzz, Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble!
Right?  Buddy?
Oh.  Oh, that's good.
What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was --
They're gonna eat us, Buzz!!  Do something!  Quick!
Woody, stop it!!
Oh, I'm a sham!!
Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help.
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
Woody!  It's the moving van.
Woody?!  What are you doing?
Me?  No, no, no, no...  Are you?
It's not a laser!  It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
Oh, that is disgusting.
What?
I don't know!
No she's NOT --
MOM!!  MOM!!
Oh, no!
Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
Good going, Slink!  Now, just, just tie it on to something!
Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...
This town ain't big enough for the two of us!
Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
You'll need to know who we are, we're the brothers of his wife, which makes us in an unsanctified kind of way, your uncles. Me name is Finn, me brother is called Francie -
I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it.
You're only a young thing.
Would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while?
Surely she is older?
I already lost everything once.
Everything is gone, now.
They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us.
Did you do this?
I appreciate you coming in so early.
Anna.  What's wrong?  What do you want?
He's not here.
Got it?  Good.  Do not discuss anything over the telephone.  Do not talk to the neighbors.  Stay out of your yard.
How much do I pay him?
Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people.  Only Carl knows who they are.  That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't know Ruiz.  Church and State.
That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid.
So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?
And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
So you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise.  Superfund is just one of those words.  People stop paying attention.
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar.  It's this General, Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.
You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.
Oh, it is?
Should we bring the police into this?
He didn't hang around us.  He's like one of those hippie kids.  I'm not part of that group.  It was a party in all these rooms.  His girlfriend who I barely know was completely hysterical... He's blue, he's puking... We didn't want to get in trouble, but what were we supposed to do?  I mean, what would you have done if you had been us?
We'll get through this, I promise. I'll make it up to you --
As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time".
I don't know.
Live with your parents?
Parents still together?
What are you doing?
Inhale the smoke and hold it.
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
Remember when we sat on that mob guy, that chef, for like six months?
What do you think it is?
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
Take this back with you.  Deliver it safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and we have a deal.
Relax.  If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.
Please.  Filing a report will not help you find your car.
Yeah.  It should be fun.  You wanna come?
What is the name of your informant?
I've read official estimates but I wouldn't bet my house on them.  I've heard the entire cocaine supply for the United States can fit into four tractor-trailers.  At least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope, with drivers employed by people who don't give a damn if they're caught or not.
I'm looking for my daughter, Caroline. She comes here.
I got money.
Can you tell me anything?  Do you have any ideas?
What?
I recruited the best men in Mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process.  Not only physical, but also psychological.
Well, why didn't you bring them?
I want the money, Mark, that's all.
I don't know, maybe I'll buy something for my ma, and then buy some good speed, no bicarb like, then get a girl, take her out like, and treat her -- properly.
Excuse me, I don't mean to harass you, but I was very impressed by the capable and stylish manner in which you dealt with that situation. I thought to myself: she's special.
Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.
I don't see why not.
What do you want?
I read it in Cosmopolitan.
Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.
I'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now.
Thanks, Mark.
If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your Giro is fucking finished, right?
But try too hard --
Who wrote it?
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
Do you see the beast? Have you got it in you sights?
Did he -- you know?
You know.
Cut it out.
I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.'  Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?
What was your price?
Excellent.
Sure.
It's fresh air.
Useless motherfucker, that's what she called me. I told her, I'm sorry, but theses things happen. Let's put it behind us.
What do you see as your main strengths?
Why? Why have you done this to my friend?
Sulu, what are you doing?
What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
Bob?
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
Besides, I can't believe you'd kill me for a field of empty holes.
Your pain runs deep.
But how?
You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?
Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is non-operational. Captain, we've received important orders from Starlet Command.
Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.
Oh, God
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
Come on, Spock. Why didn't you jump in?
Captain?
Life is not a dream.
Not General Korrd.
Be one with the horse.
Exactly 15.5 seconds.
What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
It would appear we are too heavy.
Spock.
...mark two.
Spock?
Who are you?
Sha Ka Ree. "The Scource." "Heaven." "Eden." call it "Qui'Tu." To the Romulans, it's "Vorta Vor." The Andorian word is.. unpronounceable. Still, every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang. For us, that place will soon be a reality.
No... I didn't.
No special conditions?


I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
They can't be serious. The ship's in pieces and we've less than a skeleton aboard.
No, no, no. Scotty - Scotty... There's so much I want to tell you.
Sybok, you must surrender.
Why not?
Sybok - this is not the God of Sha Ka Ree - or any other God!
You did break in.
I don't get it.
Dillinger?
I want to go to his place.
Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.
Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
where's your program? Won't it miss you?
This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
That was uncalled-for.
What's that?
How about over there...that empty memory?
You're alive!
Flynn...  Where's Ram?
We're on our way.  Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go up against Master
What about our friend - Sark?
Not us, I hope.
How did you do that, Flynn?
But... won't you be de-rezzed?
You're a..."guest" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games.
Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at my terminal, down in the laser lab. We'll be up in Alan's office.
you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for?
Thank. you, Master Control.
Yes, MCP.
You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know, a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User even wrote you...
But-what if I can't...?
The Users...you really think they're still there?
You think we can make it there?
My quarters.
This is Flynn... the one who busted me out.
You bitch.
No you're not.  You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake!
That's not true, honey--
I'm done.
And this is a little above market-				* rate for the horizontal bop, even				* for a total biscuit like her.
They call him "The Sand Spider".				*
What?  It's on the way.  She says she's got something for me.
Station wagon?
Hey, did that guy Harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet?  Cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch --
So, you wanna play huh?  You little--
Look, uh... I've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. I'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.
Just hang a minute.
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.
Guy's a spook!
Give me the page.
--you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--
I'd like to remind you that it has been ten years since you were actually in one of these.
So, it was your first time.
Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?
Well, what's the point of waiting?
So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
I've always been a collector at heart.  When I see something I want, I have to have it.
Yes.
Hello, Harry.
This is Samir.  See if you can guess his specialty.
That's fabulous Harry.
I'm sorry.  Thank you for the party.
Uh huh.
You weren't attracted to him at all?
Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker.
Would you say he was boring, then?
Let me out of her!  Right now!
My husband can't know about this.
I can do it!
So last night was pretty exciting, huh?
Now slide the nylons off one by one.
What were you doing there?
Harry, what's the matter with you?  Tell them the truth.  We're married, we have a daughter--
She's really a fox, isn't she?
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  He looked like such a dope.
Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them.
Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
What does she do?
See.  You and this car were meant for each other.  Why fight it? Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I like your style.  Whattya say?  Should we start on the paperwork?
Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.
Did you read the papers yesterday?
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
To our assignment.
It's a good thing you pay me well.
Not yet.
That was so good I am gonna have another.
... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid before, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished, crowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and my dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus appears, and the bus-driver says, "Get her in here.". He forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was from. And, so there you go.
Not at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba.
The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.
Great movie. Action-packed!
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
Tell me about yourself.
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.
Like it?
What are your turn-ons?
Turn-offs?
Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.
You're a whore?
I do.
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
Where you goin', honey?
You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK?
I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to do most, but couldn't.
Damn skippy. He like it, too.
Yeah.
All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
You comin' to L.A.? When?
I'm a married man.
Alabama, could you tell Clar -
Money problems?
It's fuckin' real!  It's fuckin' real!
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
This is Drexl's coke?
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
The zoo.
Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.
I got the part on "T.J. Hooker".
Do you really mean it?
Now's a helluva time to play "what if".
No. But thanks.
What?
Elliot.
Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to "Doctor Zhivago" are in arbitration?
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
I think there's a Seven-Up in there.
I really don't know.
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?
I'm me... I mean, that's me.
Where'd he come from?
Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.
Krinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin' into somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts  cryin', and then it was all over -
Like gang-busters. Now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta put your boss in jail.
He saw the wire.
I'll keep lover boy here entertained.  You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her suck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's done it before. But I want you as a audience.  Marty, what the fuck are you doin'?
Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny.  There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit -
Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!
You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?
How do you know? You been there?
Yes.
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
Women will want to get to know you...
San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
Do you know why you're here, James.
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
You're afraid of germs?
What year do you think it is?
It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.
You used to call me "James".
My father told me that.  "Never cry wolf."  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.
About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
All I see are dead people.  Everywhere. What's three more?
We need gas.
See -- you can drive after all!
Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.
I need help all right.  They're coming after me.
The gun! ... I lost it
You... you couldn't have heard me.
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
You were in my dream just now.  I didn't recognize you.
That's what they were up to!  Freeing animals!
James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West!
So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future?
What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.
They hurt you!
Never saw him before in my life.  Go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do.
Excuse me -- what did you say?
County Hospital, right?  1989.  The "Immaculate Escape" -- am I right?  Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too.
I don't have time to go upstairs.  The police are looking for me.  I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.
Plan?  What are you talking about?
But you know what's real now?
He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
What...virus?
That would explain the bruises, I guess.  The struggle.
Nine thirty
Tight?  My watch says 7:30.
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
Ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
The day wasn't so bad.  We all got through it all right.
We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
I'll take a piece of that bet. I say it doesn't come up five times each side.
One way, or round trip?
Please, you don't understand.  I have to get out of here.  They're going to come looking for me. They're going to kill me.  If I can't get this ticket then I'm going to have to do things to get out of here.  I don't want to hurt anybody, I just want to leave.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
But he's dead.
That'll make five in a row.  Never seen it so hot.  Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed.  I'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze.  I was in Mexico this one time--
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Hey.
How much?
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, hon.  Enjoy your beer, and try to have a nice day.
Ned!  Now look at what you done! Are you all right?
For the love of God would you two give it a rest?  Lord almighty.  In all my years I have never seen anything so pathetic.  How far did you think you were going to get with this?  Neither one of you can wait to slit the others throat.  Now use what little smarts you got.  If I was going to bust you I wouldn't have waited until after you killed Jake.
Who was that on the phone?
What's the matter?
How could I?  I was sleeping.
I don't hear anything.  You were dreaming.  Or maybe the wind blew something over.
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
It's nothing.  Really.
What happens if you lose?
Nice place you got here.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
You never did answer my question.
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
I don't know how.
How far is it to California?
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
Grace . . . Grace?
You don't know?  Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?
If you want.
Get it, and put the money in it. Pack up anything else you want to take with you.
It doesn't matter.  He was there and he let it happen.  He can't take us in.
I shot him.
He was going to take the money.
I can't make it.  Grace?  Grace!?
John, throw me the keys.
I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
Who the hell are you?
I . . I was helping your wife.  I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
I have half a mind to--
I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
What brings you to Sierra?
Where you headed?
Hey!
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
I'm not rambling.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
Maybe not this time, but somebody's going to get dead around you.
Yeah, well, me too.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about killed some guy over a girl.  Not for money, for a girl. And she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me.  Same way Grace played us this morning.  I don't like that, Jake.  Not twice in one day.  And maybe I'm so pissed I'd twist the next off my own Grandma to get out of here.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?  Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.  Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it.  A man's got to protect his home.  His wife.  You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.
What are you babbling about?
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
Two-hundred dollars.
Toby!  Toby Tyler, leave him alone!
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter?
What happened to your hand?
You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
They're not very imaginative?
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
Mister!
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
Nooo!
Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.
Saw you at the truck stop this morning.  You're not from around here.
Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.
I didn't do anything.
Nobody's going to hang.  We're all gonna walk away with a little something.  I ain't a greedy man. And, hell, you did all the work. One-hundred-thousand dollars.  Split that three ways and it comes out to about thirty-three thousand.  Give or take.
Got any cold soda?
Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick.
Oh, Jesus.
Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
Christ, I don't believe this!
Now, what's this?
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
A lot that means.
You can't just walk in here and walk out, you sonufabitch! I'm gonna tear you a new asshole!
Say, what happened to your hand?
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
"You can't shoot 'em!" I like that.  I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house to hang drapes. Oh that's a good one. Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face.  I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. Then me busting in like some wild bear. Ha! Bet you had a fire going under you.
What can I do for you, lad?
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
I came for Grace.
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
But you was going to fight for me.
Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
You own this place?
How much time?
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
I don't know, but "it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through."  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole.  You can keep that dollar. Now why don't you just take your American Express Gold Card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on TV and have him send you the money lickity split.
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign.
No! Okay! Okay!
And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change?
That's right on my way.
I like that about me, beautiful.
Thank you, Bobby.
You're not from around here, are you?
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
Where you coming from?
Where you headed?
What happens when you lose?
Nice place.
What do you do anyway?
Nice house for a shaman's daughter.  You must be good.
You love him?
Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can.
You'd never understand.
Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world.
Where?
It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean <u>all the time</u>.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace. 
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
I could if I had Jake's money.
I don't know about that?
I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
Yeah, if you could send it care of...
How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.
You got a beer?
Beck's.
Morning Grace.
I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It's <u>you</u>. You <u>Grace</u> or nothing. The whole thing... I want you to be my wife.... What do you way Grace?
They look nice.
You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.
What's the matter?
What's that?  ..."concealed" is a definite no no in this town, Ivan. You know anything about Jamilla's grocery store?
Get out of the car, spread them. You can jawbone all you want or you have the right to <u>shut the fuck up</u>! You commie motherfucker. Either way you're goin' to the can.
No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.
Once again please?
No, no, no, no no... You need to go now.
I'm listening.
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
Okay.
Oh shit...
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
What do I do when I'm around someone I know?
Would you like to try going--
He didn't do anything. He just told me his theory... It's sad when patients get like that. They loose reality.
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
You forgot the "Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on" step. See usually that comes before the, "It's over" Step. And it always, always comes before the "You can go" Step.  What is over?
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
I don't know what you're asking?
He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
I think it's be better if I was alone.
How much did you take off?
YOU WON'T GET HURT...
You like sports?
What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
Yeah, hello.
You are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. You were in a serious accident.  How's your vision?
Did you get up from your seat?
If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?
You told them cowboys you had it.
Where's Little Bill for Christ sake?
I couldn't find no bullwhips, Bill. The German...
I didn't mean no offense.  I guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.  Ned an' The Kid, my partners, are they... ?
Them other two, they been takin' advances on the payment.
Free ones?
I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.
Not really...  Maybe a couple of Peacemakers...  I imagine you could overlook those, eh, Bill? If you didn't see them... or hear them?
You leave me at the mercy of my enemies.
Mmmm pistols.
We got one of them fuckers, Sheriff, out by Cow Creek, we...
No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...
Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this.
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
Uh, no. No, I ain't drunk.
I guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
The... Duck of Death.
Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...
Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.
Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.
What?
I was watchin' you... seein' if you was followed.
Who killed him?
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.
A sign on him?
William Munny, yeah.
Yeah, I guess so.
He said that, huh?
Schofield? You from Schofield?
Jesus!
She's passed on, Kid.
Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
When we gonna double back?
It's gonna get riper yet.
He's in there.
Yup.
Cover me, Kid, while I mount.
That was... the first one.
Well, that fella today, you shot him alright.
You could have it. All of it.
Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em...
Three ways?
He musta been movin' right along.
Got used to my bed. Ain't gonna feel to home out here.
She gave me the evil eye.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
He ain't shootin' our way no more.  He's shootin' over that way. Who's he shootin' at over that way?
Yeah?
I seen him.
HOW MANY LEFT GODDAMIT?
Who's he?
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
No... I meant...
I was only checkin' it for you. Thought maybe somethin' was bent.
You was right to change your mind, Kid.
Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape.
He didn't even pull his pistol, huh?
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
That ain't what I mean.
I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.
Keyser Soze
&lt;&lt;We were there to buy a man and take him back to Hungary.&gt;&gt;
Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people.
&lt;&lt;It was smaller than that. Sharper.&gt;&gt;
...and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he can't release you? Can you believe that? You weren't even charged. New York police - Jesus. I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A. first thing in the morning.
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
How many times have you been in a line- up? It's always you and four dummies. The P.D. pays homeless guys ten bucks a head half the time. No way they'd line five felons in the same row. No way. And what the hell is a voice line-.up? A public defender could get you off of that.
Fuck you. I'11 never shit right again. So who did it? Own up.
Yeah. He said he did jobs for him. Indirect stuff. Always five times more money than the job was worth.
I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.
Roger really. People say I talk too much.
What are we gonna do?
I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things -
Don't hurt me.
They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.
How are they going to do it?
Three million?
What is it Keaton?
My employer requires your services. One job. One day's work. Very dangerous. I don't expect all of you to live, but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit.
You set up the line-up.
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.
The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
Even if I was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired
Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything.
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?
You know Ruby is in Attica?
No. But I'm sure Keaton's dead.
Came from Redfoot.
I came clean. I told it like it happened on the boat. So what if I left out how I got there? It's got so many holes in it, the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. So you got what you wanted out of me. Big fucking deal.
What call?
TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW EVERYTHING .
Verbal, he left you behind for a reason. If you all knew Soze could find you anywhere, why was he ready to send you off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat?
I knew him. He would never -
I didn't know. I saw him die. I believe he's dead. Christ
You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's.
Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there.
Mr. Abraham...
Abrams.  Yes.  How are you today?
How good's your intelligence?
... he wants to testify ...?
No, actually, she was referred to me.  She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
And what did your team do...
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
Objection, we've...
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
Thank you, your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code:  'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now:  we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    It's unsubstantiated and we  can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?
And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...?
It's all right, Mickey.
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
You know...sometimes people can surprise you.  Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
I read the hospital report on your client.
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much ...
Well, well, when can we meet again. I'd like to get a deposition..
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?
You know what happened.
I do.  Who is it?  The Doctors. What do you owe them?
...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Do we have time this morning to... All right.  Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
Sustained.  Yes.  The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
Galvin, look, many years ago...
I can't guarantee that...
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
I'm a lawyer.
My name's Frank.  And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.
Not if you don't grow up...
You're pressuring yourself...
What are you going to do?
Uh ...
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
Jimmy?  Bushmills.   Lookit, do me a favor.  I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
Okay.  What do you do when you don't have a witness?
...four years ago...
Yes.  Yes, I have.
... fifty thousand dollars?
... I understand ...
He saw her at the Northern Care...
We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away.
Who told you that?
Kathy Price...
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
Yes.
What did she say?
One hour.
I want to buy you a drink.
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you?
Doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?
Like all this.
Would you like a drink now?
Not what you think. We're very happily married.
No.
How often does this happen?
I want you.
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
Why did she never tell her daughter?
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
Listen, what is this? What do you want?
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...
Will you, Judy?
I like that one.
But I like that one, Scottie.
Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but --
That's what I had in mind.
I've got it.  He bends down and bites the back of her neck.
We're going awfully far.
And I couldn't follow her.  God knows I tried.  One doesn't often get a second chance. I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chances, Judy.
Yes!
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power...  he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything?
Where were you?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
Meet again, sometime.
I don't know.
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
How can you be sure?
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
And no birds sing.
Would you like a drink of water?
Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...
Where?
Where were you born?
But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them.
There's a name on the gravestone.
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.
Where?
Madeleine --
It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
Ow!!
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?
It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.
How's your love life, Midge?
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!
I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
Mm. Better.
As a matter of fact, I thought I might give it to you.
Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
Well...
The stripper's here.
They'll get us on accesory to murder.
I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.
It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.
Name one.
I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
I have plenty of friends.
You got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife.
Are you sure this was an accident?
Her fucking head was caved in.
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
We can't do this.
How do you figure?
What is your problem?
You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here.
Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.
Where's the candy?
We'll be ready Adam.
Have you thought about what I said?
Actually, no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam...and failed to make his last payment...so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void.  Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand.
What is it?
She's not here.
That's right.
No I don't.
Keith Richards, Dean Martin...
I got her arm.
No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.
We need padded chairs.
Oh, Jesus...call the police.
Call 911.
I said, what have we done?
I don't know! I just want to get married.
What?
Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation.
That's right.
Then what do they have?
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
Take Mexico.
We're goosed! Goosed by God!
Stop it!
Stop.
The wedding cake check?
You forgot the tent?
You can't play around with these tent people.
Stop it. I'm sorry.
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality?
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
He's weird.
You expect more what?
I need your help.
I need your help.
Take care of those chairs.
Hello.
That's sweet.
How late?
What about the chairs?
What okay?
The chairs.
You fucked a prostitute?
You killed a prostitute.
Call the police.
Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.
I...Liz...all I ever wanted, was for you to be happy. I just wanted to give you the wedding, the life you always dreamed of...  ...I just love you so much...So much...
What?
But...
Just kills me...
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
I'm getting married...
Do you hear buzzing Fish?
Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me?
That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?
Boyd...I don't know man...It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins self-help thing...you're all fucked-up in the head.
Where's Boyd?
"You Send Me."
Shut up Micheal.
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
Stop this, stop this.
Enedina and Paco ...
Which couch?
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.
How like your aunt you are, even in your walk.
Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...
If you like, I will come with you tomorrow to the village when you leave.
This evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.
Yes, I don't want you ever to leave this house.
You're lying.
Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.
All that I said just now was a lie. I said it so you wouldn't leave. I only molested you in my thoughts ... I can't bear to have you leave me, hating me like this.  Tell me you believe what I'm saying and I'll let you go.
Don't lie. You don't believe me either.
They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
It won't take but a minute. It's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor.
Ramona! Ramona!
Why the bad temper?
If you wake first, wake me up.
What I do every day, but I want to do it earlier.
What are you thinking about?
Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.
Are they going to work here too?
He's good at rabbiting and he knows it. When we're in the country, if he doesn't hunt he doesn't get fed.
Don't say that.
Yes -- very, very big!
Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
She looks like a sick marrow!
Ask the priest, miss.
What happened to me?
Good morning, Rita. How are we today?
I'm going to the hen house. Are you coming with me?
) Daryl Lindenmeyer was only here briefly, one semester at most. But he was singularly the most brilliant student I ever had in a classroom. He created programs so beautiful, so lyrical, they were almost like symphonies...
Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did.
When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head?
I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.
What's the assignment?
What did you find out?
It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter.  Did you find out where the bomb is?
What the hell happened?
It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.
Of the six prison inmates you've tested —— all of whom have had at least some military or survival training -— only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.
You've had a year—and—a—half to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
How does he know who I am?
HEY!!!
Don't be angry with me, Daryl.
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
How can I ever thank—you for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?
You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?
I'm surprised you didn't write one about me.
Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?
I am the demon from the bottomless pit...
I am impressed.
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
What does that mean?
Which way?
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go —— right now.  Why are you going to do this?
Where the hell are you going?
How's your pulse?
Then shoot him already.
I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you——

What C-4...was Cox talking about?

Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe." Yuk yuk.
Hey the door was open.
Sure...lots of guys at the track talk like that... but how do you know you'll have any dough next month...  What's this? I gave you two hundred.
Problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you're never happy 'cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you. Money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me... thanks.
Whatever night you like.
Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.
It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get.
Hello Bud, I'm Lisa, a friend of Gordon's.
I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?

Hi sport.
See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen...
...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.
What about hard work?
I'll be right there, fix them a drink.
And I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.
Now, wait a minute, Dad...
You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
Hello Bud.
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
What if I have a previous engagement?
...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...
Hi.
Morning Buddy, you look happy.
You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.
Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.
I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne? Celebrate, just like the old times Sunshine.
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.

Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured.
He did?
Businessman?
Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
But?
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
Oh Mark.  It's ok.  It's ok.
And uh, your nicotine sir
No Jonathan.
She went to a waxwork party
Can I give her a message?
Haven't we been doing our homework.
Getting scared?  Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.
Then why do you still like her?
No Mark. MARK Why not?
Well, it all started when a friend and I
Sarah listen to me.
I can't believe she went out with that monster last night
No thank you sir we're fine.
Well?
Any student of Black Magic can do it.   .most of these books will tell you how! SARAH So what happens when you've sold out?
Can this be stopped?
Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
Of course you will.
I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
I miss you.
She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.
Your friend saw them.
She said, "You know."  That I know.
I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
For the Dupont Chair.  I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst.
I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.
When...when will she be back?
Who are you?
He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...
Oh God.  He's back.  I'm sorry.  Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying.  Please...
Love.
Mrs. Frank?
Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha nonsense.
Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She wanted to stay close.
He looked like one of the Monkees.
I didn't sleep with him.
He was so pissed.
How you holding up?
You are?
Oh my god.  You bought it.
Absolutely.
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
Wow.  I'm losing it.
We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?
I have to go.
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
Does Norman know?
Okay.  Okay.
Jody, she tried to kill him.
I can't believe this is happening.
Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it.
She's awake.
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
How are you?
Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...
What are you doing here?
What do you mean?  Some noises where?
Think I may have cracked it.
I think so.  Maybe.
Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...
"...of Perpetual Distances."  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  I say...
Our house.
When you do this, I swear...
Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
Keep your voice down.
You don't remember?
You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.
It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not...
It's too rough.
I don't like this, this...
It was last year.  We were having troubles.
I never asked you to quit!
THAT'S NOT TRUE!  You wanted to quit!  And then when you did, you hated me for it... so you gave it all to her.
Can't you see, she's trying to kill us.
The leaves...
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
Do you know it?
What's that for?
You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?  They're reaching out to you, Rowan!
Aaron - lieten to me...  It's been Lasher - from the start!
Rowan...
You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
Down here. darling, we figure: If you're taking a trip to God knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party.
Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
Who is this...?
I don't have any aunts - and I've never heard of a 'Carlotta' - or, for that matter - a 'Diedre'!  Just who -
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
And that is why I pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her...
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
Lasher - bring us through!
uh - then he - be just -
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
STOP!
The wasps were meant for Michael - but there's only so much you can control, isn't there?  The great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-..  Why would you hurt him...?!  Answer me.
YOU VIOLATED ME!!!  ON MY WEDDING NIGHT!
I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers...  Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...?  to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.?  I did not choose to be such as this!  Suzanne brought me here.  She called to me!
Go on. Rowan.  Go on.
Oh god...
Just one.  The bar's closed.
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
Harder...
It's unbelievable that you can do that.
My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
I was born, in New Orleans, too-
He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.
Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans.  Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me.  I'll call you there.
C'mon.  Let's go to the ho---
Do you love me, Michael...?
What about your work back home...?
I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.
You sure...?
No - I didn't kill him.   Would you rather I'd let them kill us - after they'd raped me...?
Michael - what made you fall in love with me...?
If it's a boy --- Taylor.
When aid you get home last night...?
You've gone away from me, Ro...  Someplace I don't know how to get to.
Well, Normie - you won't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time.  How are the hands...?
A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville.  Oh, sweet decadance.
Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.  I mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...?
We'd better get to work on the papers.
Standard for a Mayfair marriage.  Rowan - there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets. They must be... aahhh... held separate from the other party... Michael  that is it's in the will - for centuries.  Tradition enjoins, Rowan.   of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into -
That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
Sounds good - thank you
You see, I am writing this article for CHIC MAGAZINE
All the time?
Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
I don't know
Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
How long have you been watching me?
Tell me about your wife...
then why did you marry her -
And how did it feel to be rid of him
What's wrong?
Yes...
Where are you going?
whats wrong...what have I done wrong?
I don't want either of us to come to any harm - please...
Is LESLIE here?
It did give me a chance to meet you again ELLEN - It's all routine you understand...So where were you?
You're a novelist - why didn't you tell me?
ANGEL...
Someday, I'll find out.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
I can't believe that's your mother. We're talking babe-a-licious chub fest, right here in the 501's.
This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro.
Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
Check this out.  Hurry!
I get it now. You and me. We're dead.
Hell yes, all hundred and seventeen of 'em!
You got everything you ever wanted.
Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month. It's your job, Ted, to decide which of them is right.
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
Well. The prom's coming up.
Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.
I remember the first time you walked into Mrs. Temple's class in 2nd grade. Blue gingham dress. Blond ponytail.
Well?
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
We understand your disappointment, Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous...  We...uh...we understand your disappointment.
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
You're way ahead of me again?
Son.
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted! Now you're ashamed of me?
THAT is your dream, not mine. My dream is so far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine.
Teddy? I was thinking.
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
Ted! Do something!
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
Well?
But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.
I wondered about them, for so many years. I wondered if I looked like them, acted like them. I wondered why they gave me up.
Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty."
Are they okay?
I miss them, too.
You're a peach.
But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.
So, William Randolph. Your last big scoop contrasted the popularity of Rice Crispie Treats and chocolate Snickerdoodles at the annual bake sale.
Is it true? Is ignorance bliss?
A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
What do you want from me? I'm trying to be fair. But I can't keep you on staff if you turn every PTA meeting into an Agent Orange cover up.
I guess.
Don't write that part.
Well? What do you think of her?
You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?
I mean my father.
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
You're amazing.
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
Do you trust me, Julie?
You're telling me you don't get aroused by a roomful of naked breasts.
Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.
You promise you'll finish school?
Don't you get it? In one day I earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue.
Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?
I like you, Ted. You know that. I liked you before you were filthy rich.
That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
I'm warning you.
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right?
You were the new and improved you.
I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.
I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--
What are you doing?
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her.
She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
Did you try to fight him?
Try, Kelly.
How long?
I don't know what to say...
Kelly's file.  Read it.  You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify.
Same as him.  They saw her come.  They saw her go.  They saw him follow.
Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right?  So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life.
We all have...
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
Will you do me one favor?
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
About a year ago.
At that point were you able to fight him off?
That doesn't make him a child rapist.  There's something else.  This girl's had some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars.  Ran away...
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
I say something funny?
The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.
Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.
Is that Sam Lombardo?
Okay, what's the matter?
What?
Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off.
Kelly...
We have to stick with the plan.
Kelly.  Is Suzie there?
So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip the graduation parties.  You'll never see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you.
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
Forget it.
You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan.
I just want my life back...
It's Celine.  He's okay.  He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.
You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie.  You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.
Davy.
Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
Yes.
But she ran away.
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
But I..
I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
Always hoping.  Or this...
You feeling all right?
Now, what was that?
Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
Damn it, this is ridiculous.
So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
They're so precious when they're asleep.
Can you fill me in here?
This is good.
Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.
So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.
We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
There's only seventy-eight.
My hat is off to you, sir.
Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!
A new friend?
Anyone?
My name's Tyler.  Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.
You've... done... this... before.
My.  It's gotten longer.
Your private train, sir.
Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
French?
But what would anyone have to gain from all this...?  Unless it were a foreign power.
I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant.
... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!
Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.
The U.S. is my jurisdiction.
Dr. Pemberton?
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
He... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
Madmartigan!  What did you do this time?
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
You are very important, Willow.
They look like acorns.
I can't.
Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.
Why did you say that?
Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here?
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf!
Madmartigan, I need your help.
I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!
Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong?
She's a bird, Willow.
I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
I could be you rguard!  I could carry your spear!
Did *you* give that acorn its power?
I hope she's all right.  How much more do I have to do of this?
I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?
I just wanted to test it first.
Tir Asleen.
I did it!  Madmartigan!  Come here! Look!  You gotta see this!  I did it!
Madmartigan.
We are emissaries of her majesty, Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of Coshairm.
Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.
Where's Timmy and Buck?
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
Your hole is healed, then?
Everything is all right, John.
How reliable is this kid?
Amish.
When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
They kid a lot.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
Where are you taking us now?
Who are they?
John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
But Stoltzfus said...
What else can you do?
You're so sure of that?
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
I want you to take this... to remember by.
I got there late, John.
Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, I want you to lose it for me, Now. Tonight.
You'd lie to protect him.
God, Fred...
Who was that man?
How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?
We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.
She say where he is?
Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. What do you figure they plug all their shit into?
Momma... are they angry with us.
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
No --
...have you come back?
...resourceful!
If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!
... -- Oz -- has spoken!
Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
Oh --
Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
Oh, please give me back my dog!
No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
Ahh!  Ah!
I thought you said she was dead.
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
That dog's a menace to the community.  I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
Oh --
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
And bears!
Can't that female take no for an answer?
Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.
...yes.
What -- what did you do that for?  I didn't bite him.
It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --
A home --
I'll be home in time for supper!
Supposin' you met an elephant?
That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!
...yes.
I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
I don't blame you for that.
Hooray!  I guess that did it!  Help yourself.
Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!
Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
...along.
Dear, whatever shall we do?
...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
Yes, you.
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 
Whozat?
Where do we go now?
You don't get around us that easy!
That's right.
Come on -- come on --
Did you hear that?  He'll announce us at once!  I've as good as got my brain!
...to Dorothy!
Oh, I hate to think of her in there.  We've got to get her out. 
What about us?
Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, I’ve heard them all.
Shame you had to spot I wasn’t the real thing.
What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
What the hell are you talking about?
But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe...
Who told you to look at Elektra’s files?
I’m well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position..
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
In case you’ve forgotten.  I’m dead already.
Beautiful, isn’t it?
Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
I met you at my father’s funeral.
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially King’s daughter.
What is it?
I don’t want to be safe!
Vodka martini.
Are you saying...Renard is the man who’s trying to kill me?
I’m coming with you.
I could have given you the world.
Was this all about the oil?
Know what happens when a man is strangled?
One... last... screw?
Valentin Zukovsky.
If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
Perhaps this isn’t the time...
We’ve been pawns in someone’s game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.
Do we have the range of Renard’s plane?
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
Why?  What's the problem?
Walter --
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
The bearer of bad news.
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
Blake?  Dead?
I could stay and go.
Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
What -- am I --
Jon, where are we?
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
Don¹t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won¹t even be here, will we?
I¹m not.
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
Laurie --
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
They're practically on us . . .
Welcome back, Night Owl.
He saved himself.  He changed the past.
Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
. . . And they call me a fucking nut.
You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
I'm terribly sorry.
Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
Adrian.
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.
Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
What is this place?
Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
Congratulations, you've just graduated at the head of your class.
You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.
How about a pedicure as long as you're down there. What's this? Lo-Jack?
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.
Up yours.
Snow covered fortress. Army of bad guys. The usual.
Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
How will you fix it?
Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time.
You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys?
Like what?
You do everything Yorgi says?
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
A beach named X? That I'd like to see.
What's that?
Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
We can't leave now. We have to do something.
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
Where's he headed?
Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
This is your standard dart gun.
French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
Dude, what are you doing here?
I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
That's the guy.
What's this?
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.
It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
Scott.. I -
What's wrong with him?
I'm going to assume that means that the Secret Service is out of commission.  Jean, can you raise me up there?
If necessary.
He's uptight.
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.
How?
Don't you knock?
Why?  You have a home here now, if you want it.  Everyone will...
Why is everybody up at sunrise?
What did she do to me?
Is that so?
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
This checkmate goes to you.  I didn't want to hurt anyone.  But you leave me no choice.
What was your grandfather's name?
Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron.  But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle.  These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears.  How say you?
Carlson!
You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?
MMMmm!
Still happy you married me?
Love me oodles and oodles?
Darling!...you will be careful!?
You have your tickets?
Darling!
Surprised?
Ready, darling?
What a strange fellow.
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
There seem to be quite a few books.
What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?
How long will this whole thing take?
I didn't do that.
In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?
But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
You have more chance of re-animating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system,
I see.
Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs.
There wolf!  There castle!
Aye-gor!
Did you hear that strange music?
Do you have the name I wrote down?
The ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing.  We shall penetrate into the recesses of nature.  We shall ascend into the Heavens.  We shall command the thunders of Heaven, mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.
It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?
But don't you see...the brain of Hans Delbruck is inside this grotesque hulk -- pleading with us.  I've got to untie it.
Yes.
Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
There's only one way.
MMMmmmmmm.
What's that tune that you're playing
Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine.
It wasn't me.
Oh, Doctor!
It's terrible -- the price society demands in the name of fidelity... ultimately?
It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.
MMMMmmmmm!
Are you ready for me?
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
No, not sound.
It's working!  Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully.
Igor -- are you sure the monster has a good brain?  Are you absolutely certain that you took the brain of Hans Delbruck that night?

Another fifteen seconds to go.
Will we be fighting the Zulus soo~, Quartermaster? .
1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir
You intended to bring your reserves across the river?
Tomorrow we will continue our advance on Ulundi. Dumford, kindly return to your unit Bring them here immediately to support Pulleine. Mr Vereker will join you as ADC. Do you understand me clearly?
The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
Choose your targets men. That's right Watch those markers. 55
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
Well I assure you, Sir, I have no desire to create difficulties. 45
