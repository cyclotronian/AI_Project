I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
Father Marchena!
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
I'm abused.  Don't you think?
Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?
Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.
Yeah, I see her.
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
It's not?
You... you need to go to the police.
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
No problem. Look, I...
He's asleep. We were up very late.
Take care, Wade.
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.
How potent?
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.
What medicine?
Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is?
You're a very beautiful girl.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
Now what do you want to talk about?
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
Did you hear that?
I remember once when your account checked.
What the --
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
I've only shown this to three other people. I bought 200, we've launched 12 so far. I keep the coordinates in this room.  It's left over from SDI. Reagan's Star Wars technology? They orbit 426 miles up.
Wanted to say goodbye to him...
I hate having my picture taken.
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
When are you going to catch the prick that's doing this, Don?
That ain't funny.
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
Good night, papa.
That'd be my reaction too --
You shot Childs and Nunez.
He -- He made me do it --
He said he worked there --
We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
I lied to you. It was wrong. But at the time... I didn't know what to do. Imagine you got an earful from folks about that gal I's carryin'...
You ain't the kicker, are you?
This don't feel right. Kitchen looks just like I left it. I know, cuz I cleaned it.
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
He could?
But you haven't put in for emigration.
Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters.
But I understand what you mean.
We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're both professional dancers.
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
Could we talk about that a little later?
I'm afraid you've got to.
I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.
You can hit me, if you want to.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
Well.
What did you see?
Jeffrey? What's going on?
What are you going to do?
Come on.
The guy is fucking insane.
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
No more water, you said.
I've got all this back pay coming.  Why don't you let me get you a place in town?
Stop waving that thing around.
Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.
Ten percent.
Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need, isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice...
Where did you go to school?
Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?
I need a diameter approximation.
You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...
Soon, baby.
I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.
Sorry.
I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
Why would I tell Mom?
I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
You don't know where this is gonna...
How long will I stay here?
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
I'm sorry.
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
You must have been crazy.
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
I'm cold.
90 over 50 and falling... .
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
I want to leave fast.
Could I have that, please?
You're lying! You were after the evidence. Who put you up to this -- the manager?
One keg of Beast for the basement, then, truck's dry.
Stop it.
He's dead.
Fine, Chief.
I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?
How's it feel?
Unless you Whiskey Run.
So you made it.
Not for a long time, now.
That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint.
I'll expect you for dinner this evening, Captain Hamilton.  For Christ's sake, have a bath.
Martha... what?
Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of "Freaks" and put 'em in this other one, "Mr. Loverboy".
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.
But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
Well when can we do something?
I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...
That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not --
Occasionally
I want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to want that. It's just that Marcus trusts me.
I do.
657-2036
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
Oh!
You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.
Any letters?
Come here. 
The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
All right.
Roy? It this all we have?
She didn't see you, in other words.
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
Help your mother find the bullet.
How do I load?
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
Dead!
Yes, he is.
Do it!
What's T-J?
What are you doing here?
Why don't you tell me something for a change?
And what are you studying?
Mmmh -- "Pamcakes." We're going out --
We've got such sights to show you --
Hey.
Are you coming home?
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
Hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, I'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here.
You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half as bad and lived.
When your father died I saw to it that the grounds were kept up.
You're one of William's kids, huh?
Nothing to be sorry about.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
Can't we just see the end?
Here's to music. And absent friends.
Really? Huh, I thought for sure you'd say Lynette Fromme. She's got that snooty vibe I know you dig.
We've got get out of here, we got get out of here.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
I know you're my guests and welcome but I'd please advise you to keep from cussing while in my house, thank you.
I'm buyin'.
I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?
We're going to be moving, son.
Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
Not really...
You can't go. Call them back.
Fraulein -- will you permit me?
It is you Junior!
Mola Ram is telling the faithful of out victory. He says the British have left the palace, which proves Kali Ma's new power.
India...
...and sort of...disinterest.
What's Gruner like?
I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.
I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.
Hello?
See that. They're gone!
I'm not sure I understand.
I gave you my card there.
I don't think so.
It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell.
I thought I did.
Were you a disco girl?
Did you ever go I one?
Goddam you. Gimme that bag,
As low as two.
I'm alive.
You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
Then what do we do?!
I'm with you kid.
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
Kicker, anything?
Quint...?
Gettin' ready to run again -- no? No?  What's he playin' here?  Put the gloves on!  Let's see who's gonna tease who now!
Excuse me?
Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
Uh huh.
I'm sorry.
You are being ripped open.
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
Why there?
You know what, I can play baseball with my brothers when I'm bigger.
I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something... I guess what I'm saying is... that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful.
Almost.
When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!
Ride like wild fire, Jack.
It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport.
They tricked you.
I don't beg.
I gave up on you.
Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
Why aren't you in Nursery?
Uh-huh.
I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your name may be.
What about your meeting?
When all this is over and we're not working for Maxie, I'd love to run into you on the street.  Why aren't you coming?
What can I do for you?
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?
Now, look, John. Here's the speech. It's in caps and double-spaced. You won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous, are you?
First things is, don't say, "What's going on?" Everybody knows what's going on. I come into this situation, I say,  "I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's good. I'm here to help you."  Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. Which you are. If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. You don't want him nervous. Got that?
I worship you.
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
What did he tell you?
I'm sorry.
Wow.  Sand.
Same here.
Tommy Reina's gone over to Maranzano, but so far Masseria ain't lifted a finger,
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
<i></i> I beg your pardon?
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
Well--goodnight.
I know. It's--Violet.
Lena.
*Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!
Why, you own it, Longfellow.
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.
I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.
The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. They're getting a trifle impatient, sir.
Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them.
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
"Get to know your therapist."
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess.
He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to remember something for me, all right?
Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
When did you have a nightmare?
An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?
How does this strike you? Commissar Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow. Unexpected situation here. Duchess Swana in Paris claims jewels, and has already brought injunction against sale or removal. After long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fifty-fifty settlement as best solution. Iranoff, Buljanoff, and Kopalski.
You're right, madame, it will all be over by Thursday.
We'll see about that ...
Congratulations, boss.  A great victory!  The madman theory wasn't so crazy after all.
It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.
CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago.
He was a politician.
Howya doin'!  New York treating you okay?  I'm sorry I haven't been able to see you at all--
That's the boy.
...If I don't come back tell Mother I love her.
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
Bourbon, little water, thank you.
Who gave you this idea?
Zack, we've got to go.
Far fucking out! I've been wanting to meet one of the Blue Angels since I can remember.
'Bout four o'clock.
Little Bobby... Just a kid...
Rachel not feeling well?
Thank you. Thank you so much.
You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face.
Do you remember about five years ago, that uh... incident at Purnell Labs?
You were never invited to my house.
Just look at it!
This is wonderfully accommodating of you all.  Now I won't have to come looking for you.
I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse me - I mean Mr. Smith.
I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.
Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...
Why's it here?
Nothing.
I know but I....how much is it?
This makes me very uncomfortable.
I'll die of loneliness! I've no company but the characters I create --
You're just scared.
What do you want me to do, Orson? Radio City won't premiere the picture. Louella threatened them with some bullshit about
How's that?
Open the door, Vickie.
Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
What do you think?
What's he going to pull--
You awake?
You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
Let's go over it. Where are you?
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.
Don't fuckin' patronize me.
Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.
This part removes the sense of humor.
Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!!  Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him.
Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?
It does. Feels right.
Nice, huh?
You know how often these pourers get hit on?  I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
No.
The same windows.
Paden sends his best.
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?
Then show some.  They'll shut me down!
Hi.
Man, that's great.
Here. Sit.   Please.
I want to hear your version.
It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.
Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own.  We can afford it now.
She's got to identify him.
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!
No volunteers, Price. I said we're all in on it.
I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
Well, Mr. Saavik, are you going to stay with the sinking ship?
Heard there was some excitement.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
... Gone?!
Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
Jak'tahla?
Worf to Picard...
Worf, you must hurry...
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...
We saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data.
Sweet Jesus...! He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is...
Perhaps with a few small steps at a time. Like this one.
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
How did you - ?
 Believe me, we don't under- stand it either. You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
With a full head of hair.
Jennyhaydn.
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
Sounds like Tick's already celebrating.
Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.
...well, there was some friction: I wanted to write up my work, educate the public, but Koessler wouldn't allow it. Low felt Koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers. Koessler had Low reassigned to the Pacific Northwest, Seattle. You know when they say, stick it where the sun don't shine? That's where they stuck Dick Low.
Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about "Zorro Killer" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out, has it?
Don't even go there. What's up?
I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
No, man. I need to use the phone.
Don't remind me.
All right, Hollywood...Now tell me about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta who won't let you work.
Get the car.  I'll be leaving in ten minutes.  Where's Calo?
You like spaghetti?
Then the legs at the knees...
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.
Did Dickie's Dad go?
Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.
Yes?
But you're the one that wanted to get away. You're the one that came into my cab.
Not really.
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
I'm sorry.
Yes?
I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus.
I fear he may have to.
What's that you say?
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Hello--
Why not?
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
What!?  He <u>can</u> and I <u>can't</u>?!  No fair!!
Where was he trying to go?
Vox --
And centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again, we couldn't.  Our adaptation was too successful.  We survived... we endured... for this.
Why?
Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer.
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
Louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car?
Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?
You bet.
Goddamn Stevenson. Jesus. Peace at any price. You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two.
We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?
So what?
Next time I'll be ready. You get the word to who ever it is.
Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.
Is it the plane?
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
My mother find you?
No.
Edward T. Dowd.
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
...he wants to testify...?
One hour.
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
Everything went great, I thought.  We really got you, didn't we?
So, it's back to the islands.
I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
Musta been a lesson tellin' ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out?
They sure do stink.
Let's get ahold a' her quick.
I got your message... But you went right to Johnnie, didn't you?... I can't trust you, bitch - not for one minute... Naughty girl... Sailor and Lula are headed west, and guess what? There's no turning back. I'm in a killing mood.
I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp.
He's writing his name in water.
I wasn't feeling well.
You're scared.
Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
I love you.
How do you manage to put up with all this confusion? You always said people bore you.
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
She'd punish me.
How does she know that?
I've been watching. We were fine 'till she came. She brought the devil here.  There was blood on her hand that night.
I haven't decided yet.
Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?
Sure. .
Gie's a kiss!
Here, Chaz.
All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.
When?
Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now. Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.
Well... there's one indoors now. I've brought her back to see you.
You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?
We were never told flat out "Don't talk." But the message was clear.
--I know, I know, the pressure's off the White House and it's all back on the Post--
What's your middle name?
Did I miss anything?!
Oh...ungghhhhh!
And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid.
God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.
I always wanted to do that. I saw it in a movie.
You're a princess...
So whatta you... You're not gonna come back to New York?
Oh, gosh.
Escape hatch.
Are you my big hard hero?
Your phone.
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
Well I mean like they also took our fuel -- We've been here two days.
We've been attacked.
This is evil -- evil, Captain. We're all gonna die here.
When I was a boy, my father would take me there, to hunt. There are a few savages, but no man can live there, no white man.
Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?
What?
Had?
I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...
Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.
Four minutes.
One hundred thousand?  That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
Well, don't get carried away.
I figured you more as a Socialist?
Why don't we both forget about him?
So, what have you got to say for yourself? Was he good in bed?
Pictures from the play. Jamie looks pretty --
The play's going to be really good.
Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
You smoke Pall Mall?
She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--?
Apache?
Jesus... They can tell that...
Jean Michel, this is Mary Boone. She's got the great new gallery.
I'm not black.
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called – hmmm...  – yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
We got beat.
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
Selina!  Selina Kyle!?  You're fired!  And Bruce -- Bruce Wayne! Why are you dressed up as Batman?
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
What the hell did you think you were doing?
Who is The Batman, Edward?
Where are you sending Batboy this time?
How much do you weigh?
'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?
They look like a couple of kids chief.
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books.
... Evening, Chance.
Good morning, Louise.
Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?
I have to go back now.
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
You getting into bed to think about yellow?
You still know.
Can't locate him.
What run him off? Tell me that!
Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.
Dude here.
Fuckin' A.
How do you feel?
So that's down and dirty.  Got anything to say for yourself?
I see from your questionnaire that you don't have any immediate next of kin?
-- he's a vampire.
You killed Domini, didn't you, witch??
Something was wrong.
Yeah. Me too.
...What're you gonna do in Houston?
...What was that back there?
What did you take these for?
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
I asked first.
God. you scared me.
Greetings, Mr. George.
That's it.  My client doesn't have to take this crap from you.
Yes.
What did he say?
You lied to me!
Francesca?
Bones!  How baddass is zat?  This is the place for us.  Patrick, you get platinum props, man.  Platinum.
One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...
Are they on the radio?
Shut up, Violet!
Hey, Caesar!  You take care of this girl, or I find out!
It's not much, but it should get you to Switzerland.
Yes, of course. Sorry.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker.
Okay.
Play back the last line...
Nervous?
I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
Figures.
Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
Oh, yeah!
I'm yours.
No ballplayer ever said "no" to a date with me.
No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
As far as the world was concerned Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, was a legitimate guy.
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
I never see - You know, I never seen him act like that with anybody else. I think he's crazy about you. I mean, he really loves you. He does.
Oh Man, not the sewer, I just had this cape cleaned...
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
You timed that beautifully.
My fence in San Francisco ... 305-4410.  Maurice.  Don't take less than a third on the face value of those bonds.
He's back, Col
What?
I think Tex did it.
Are you in the book?
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
No, they won't -- I won't let them.
She's my daughter, Tom.
I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.
Now don't be nervous.
Hey, listen!  Do you know what I think?  I...
Okay.
Arlo!
...here, and the White House is screaming about chemical weapons,  and we're...
Get 'em on line, then stall.  Long can't have gotten far.

...tunnel now!
Would you like something to drink?
Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check.
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
You weren't expecting me?
Jesus.
She was pretty young, hunhh?
Let me borrow your car.
What the fuck did you do that for?
What're you talking about?
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
Have her come up.
What about Basil? Where's my snake?
Hullo, son, how are you?
How many to a cell?
...got off the phone with his dispatcher.  What an asshole. Cabbie's name is Max Rilke, been driving that cab for ten years...
What, no insurance?
I'm sorry, Miss Arroway, not only is it too Speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation, at this point in your career it'd be tantamount to suicide.
Do you want a cigarette? I started to smoke at the hospital. It's rather stupid of me.
No, really. Tell me about the promotion.
I don't know.
Where is he now?
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues.
Could be.
I wish to possess what you have now.
Ronald is one of the few high school students attending Juliard. He's composing his first opera.
Cecile, you have to tell me.
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped.
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word "bag." It used to be "No, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. But now "my bag" means "my fault."
What choice do we have?
Look.  If there was some mistake...
Where's it gone?
Cynthia! Sure.
Kill him... kill him.
Hello?
Ms. Harvey... my name is Taryn Miles. I'm a criminal psychologist working for the FBI. I'm here to ask you a few questions.
You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right.
Brother, Mookie, if I love you I love you, but if I hate you...
Sal's Famous Pizzeria, yeah, two large pizzas, pepperoni and anchovies, hold on...  See, Pop, Mookie fucking talking on the phone and people are trying to call in orders.  He's making us lose business.
There she goes, now wearing nothing but her underwear.
Guys, this is much better.
So what did you say to my parents on the phone?
What are you doing here?
Did they try and fail?
Who are you?  What do you want?
"Graverobbers From Outer Space"! It's <u>money in the bank</u>.
How long's he been here?
What the heck is THIS?!!
We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
Are the TV people with you?
I mean, that worked out.
You're kidding, right?
Good morning, Mr. McAllister.
I was lonely.  You took advantage
I don't know.
God knows I would, sir, but I have a previous engagement this evening.
Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
You disappeared.
He says they turned the card down.
Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.
Barks a blue streak.
I have felt it.
What do you want? You must desire it for me to weave it.
Incidentally, just a chance in a million, I know; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night?
No it's alright I'll take it straight.
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
Yes
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
The audience was a little off tonight.
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
How'd the show go?
What's it to you?  I declare it.  Here I am, back in the States for less than a month --
-- Castor?
Fighting’s a part of it, Annie.  You know that, right?
Right, for us. But...I’m afraid that if you get on that plane...
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
Yah!  I... those are in the mail.
Yah.
What do you do, Tyler?
I've got everything.  The bombs.  The army.  I've got Marla.
I know.  I've gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp. We're all meeting at my apartment tonight.
For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
Come on! Go for it! What the hell are they gonna do? They can't do nothin!
Why'nt you take 'at sign off your tit, Ray, an' let's go on out.
I'm not going to get up an' leave you.  Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.
You think I'm a fake.
Oh no, it's been much more than that.
So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.
I'm terrified.
Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
It's all over.
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
And he has finer moments now and then.
So you didn't do it after all.
Don't think too badly of her... After all, you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman.
How long before this car's hot?
Though nicer than most?
Roma!  I'm talking to you...
Are you alright?
Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you. Reminds me of old times.
... He said he had shot his Grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden.  And he asked me... he asked me, Tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge.  How does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'?
She took a flight to San Francisco. We figure she's going to connect to New Hampshire; her parents' place.
I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill...  ANYBODY.  But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't you going to tell me at all?
If that's what it takes; then yes, I will.
Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting.
The look on your face!  You're not marriage material.  You're not even boyfriend material.  You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid.
Sorry.  Not today.
How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today?
What are you doing here?
What did you hear about that thing?
Well, you just turn around and walk the other way.
They were very upset.
Well...  So you tried riding again?
Of course not.
Four plus Myers.
Look.
Annie, was that you?
Promise?
Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
No, I am.  I am.
I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.
Guess who?
I guess I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
Is it sleeping, dude?
Everyone take their places on the stage!  Isn't this thrilling?!
You have it.
Poor Father . . .
Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.
The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.
What will you do?
We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.
What if it goes south?
Don't lie to me. What's your name?
This won't do.
I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?
Wish I could take the credit, but --
Well, you know where to reach me. The church is a stone's throw away if you want to come to mass.
Hey, don't take your disguise so seriously.
I Want to make things up to you. That's why I got you this gig, doll.  Hawk, my name's George Kaplan and to quote the late, great Karen Carpenter, "We've only just begun."
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.
Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
You know what she is!  That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!
If I were as sure as you, Mrs. Rand, we wouldn't be here.  I'll tell you quite bluntly: for the peace of the island and possibly for her own safety, we've come to ask you to send Mrs. Holland away to St. Thomas.
I have to get back.
Pain is terrible for you. You feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire. You don't want it to go on.
You can't look at them...
Ray...what are you doing?
Put those things in the car and I'll get your tie and studs together.
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
I think they'll come out now.
I have two right feet.
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
Ah - - they're here.
Nurses. That's why I went into medicine.
He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
Everybody's got some, I guess.
How's the new job?
I am sorry, Lhamo.
How big is Tibet's army?
Listen, uh... Hank and I think it best if you stay on shore.
You sure?  I don't mind...
Not yet.
Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now.
What happened?
You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm?
You still going to all the home games?
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
My father says the day you're  born you start from scratch, no breaks and no excuses, and you got to pull yourself up on your own.
I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work.
Historic occasion, isn't it?
Which is why we need to talk to you about the new jail--just so we're all on the same page.
Why'd you come here?
That's too scary.
What do you want to drink?
What is it?
So...what did you think of the tape.
She came to me with a wild story about demonic possession.
What?
Later when?
Quincy, please...
Yeah.
Is this boyfriend bothering you?
I'm gonna start rolling --
I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
It's over.  I talked to her this morning.
You coulda been in front --
Porthos sleeps, and you plot.  Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting?
I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven.
Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
Linda King's desk.
He's very strong physically.
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this.
I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
Don' need you okayin'.
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
You said you liked me.
I know you said you didn't want any calls...
She has no idea who I am.
Aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers.  So...
Listen, I gotta have money.
Which way?
The word I'm getting is the Times review is gonna be a love letter.
Hi.  Hi.
What about Johnny?
Oh my God.
Why not?
What, "is"?
Bravely ran away, away.
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
What did he want?
Does that thing work?
But I'm not broke.
You'd better fix this, Ray!!!
Parking tickets ? That's it ?
Visualize a spare?
Yeah.
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
I would have tried to show her a good time. I promised her when she left that I would never forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.
I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.
Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.
I don't think so.
Well...How have you been?
I don't know who you are.
What do you think of him?
Mickey!
Scott, genius cameraman, Roger, magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I could sooner do without my arm than Unruly Julie.
My son? I ain't got no son. You Duff?
Too bad. I likes you better with her. Now, sometime you get maybe to artistic; you wind up in the clinic tanks, spare parts.
Hello, Case.
Where did you here that?
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
Who?
"March 7th - Glen asked me to sleep with him again.  I can't yet - I like him, I want to make him happy but I'm not sure that I love him. I can't sleep with someone I don't love."
So, school going alright?
Save your breath, Ms. Thompson.  Dr. Simms gave me specific instructions. Nobody gets to see Kristen -- especially you.  She made that real clear.
Oh hi.  Forget something?
Okay -- fine.
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
Yes, Mister Harding?
You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
Have you seen him with someone?
It's still the new year...
I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.
So?
Sociologist.  And because.  Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners.  They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money.
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or— or human kindness in your whole body.
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
I talk to the guy you work for, Emil. He tole me your number and where you live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you.
We still talk, though.
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
She did, huh.
I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.
We gotta face some facts here.
Does everybody have to hear?
You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things.
You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three.  We'll start with something easy. What is your name?
What do you love about it?
In some situations.
Step aboard, Carolyn.
Christ, you don't know what's out there!
'I am not a missing link.'
What happened?
Bunker...
Where's he from?
Charles!  I didn't know you were back.  Have a good holiday?
Thanks for stepping in.
It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar.
Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.
Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.
We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
What do you mean?
Good.  Yes.  Thursday.
Why?
I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'...
Tell me, just what you know of Dr. Meirschultz.
He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
Make it snappy, Colonel.
It will always afford me great pleasure to see you. 
She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area --
Afraid of the hospital?
Hasn't he got enough problems, or didn't you notice that's not cream soda on his breath?
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
D'you really wanna call?
Ya always in a bad mood --
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.
Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
How could you have done that?
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.
You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
Shortcut?
How'd what go?
What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?!
Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention.
And this woman is a writer! That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers.
Upham?
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
What?
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
Where is Sidney's father?
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
Take it off.
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
Oh shit.  Hello? Director's office.
Or a man's mentality.
Where are you going?
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
Will you calm down.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
See if you've been making it with my mother.
-- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there...
-- He reached up and tore them.
Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?
Now I said I had something for you, as I believe you will recall.
Are you leaving us?
Do you hear that?  That choir?  Eddie, in here, that's what they call music!
I can't believe this.  Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time.
What is it?
Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.
Let's go, Vaughan.  Frank, we'll be back in a little while. I'll bring you back somethin'. You're food's in the oven warmin' over.
Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.
What do you mean?
He's got something to tell you, Auggie.
Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.
Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
Bet there's a few things you could teach me.  Kendo, for one.
But suppose it doesn't?
OH!
And you'll be in all evening?
Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
You shave with your spats on?
All right, Charlie - this the joint?
Crikey.
He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.
You feel alright today, Daddy?
Dear David, if you are coming to school here, be sure to bring some warm clothes. The school term will begin September 8th, but it would be good for you to be here by the 4th or 5th of the month. I do hope everything is fine and you will be here. Give my "hello" to your family. Yours truly, Miss Camille Johnson...
He eats all right -- his throat ain't scarred.
-no Cheesy Poofs.
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
What? What do you mean you don't belong here? Relax guy, hell is for children.
Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
Evening.
Yes he did.  Yes he did. Barnes looks at the monitor - Taylor and the others are still in the dining room -
Man, I'm hungry.  I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?.
Given a malfunction, how would a rescue team get you out if the doors won't open?
You have orange whips?
You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo.
What makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum? Huh?
He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.
Yes.
I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.
Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.
I know em, I don't know what order they come in...
What?
Eight hundred grand to show her tits...
Zat true?
I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together.  <u>Hate</u>.
You try to center on the big issues, y'know.  What it's all about.  What this whole trip has meant.  But then, the <u>really</u> big issues keep swamping y...
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
Hey, Mikey!
You see, it paid off--you broke away from the old guard, congresswoman.  It won't be long till they're calling you Senator Filmore--
Give that back to me.
Yes, I stand for -
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
Use the bathroom, because the Port-a Potties on the field are gross.
If I could be of any help...
You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.
Hey, where you going?
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!
Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.
You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this.  It really isn't easy.
I can't! It's out of control!
Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.  Nuts...
Boy!
Hi, Nicole.
Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.  They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.
It's just as if I've seen a ghost today...
I didn't do anything!
I love you.  I always will.
I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.
Where'd you pick up your checks?
You did?  How is he?
Mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?
I don't know.
This is where we're going?
What kind?
She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
...Mm.
...You're not gonna screw me on this?
OK, we forget the blackmail. *You* killed him. How come?
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh...
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
Argo!  Hobbes!
Why?
Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame.
Him dying like that.
I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
Yes?
It's not safe, they say.  The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live.  Free diving is over as a sport.
Sure.
What the hell are you doing?
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
I've had it with that bum, Floyd. Stack me a cooler.
What happened to your face?
I don't know.
What about Jorgensen?
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
It's all right now, shhhh it's all right.

Are you insane? You've to get out of here at once! She may come back any minute.
It's disgraceful!
Like that!
Yes, Gaston?
We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay, here...
I know.  Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal.
Gone fishing.
Is the helicopter ready?
It was nip and tuck.
I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.
B-3.
Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible.
The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.
I'm Melanie.
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.
Big time. Absolutely fucking radge. 'It's me or Iggy Pop, time to decide.'
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.
"Row, row, row your boat..." I love "Row..."  Do - do you know "Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?"
Dumont!
Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.
What a team.  See you at eight.
There's another guy, still in the car.
Why did you continue to see him?
Where were you?  On a... uh,					* mission?
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -
We're very close!  Because of you!
I've thought about you every second since I left.  I can still taste you on my lips.
His father worked in a strip mine north of here.  Toby's school class went up to the mine one day.  School takes field trips up there every year.  Big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground.  Anyway, on this particular day Toby's dad up and falls into the machinery.
Where's the fire sweetheart? Don't know how they work things in Nevada, but we got speed limits in this state.
I assumed because of the train.
Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?
You... you remember Eagle Hendershot?
What about Redfoot?
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.
After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep.
...this is a snappy song....
We are virtually certain it isn't...
Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.
She got it.  Turned it down.
Remember how we were?
Claire?
What's wrong?
This is the life, baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK!
Oh, how inappropriate is that!
In what sense?
That's part of growing up, honey.
You kicked us off your turf, Merk. Don't rain on our parade.
And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?
But why would they murder...
Did you find him?
Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help!
...junk!
What is it?
A word? I’m sure by now he’s engineered a hostile takeover.
What??
Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.
That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.
I had to inspect the merchandise first.
I felt like she almost killed me.
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
How?
Are you busy?
