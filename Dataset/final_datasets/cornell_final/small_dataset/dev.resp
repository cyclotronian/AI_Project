<s> I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
<s> Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
<s> Make anyone cry today?
<s> Tonight.
<s> Credit?
<s> Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
<s> Good luck..
<s> You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
<s> Apipoussan!
<s> I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
<s> You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
<s> Avoid-all-contact-day.
<s> Don't worry, honey
<s> It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
<s> I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
<s> Toward the Pole!
<s> Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
<s> Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
<s> Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to the right. Got it?
<s> Accelerators down.
<s> Did you learn anything?
<s> Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.
<s> On my way.
<s> Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
<s> That's right.
<s> In a harem.
<s> Do you have bad dreams, too?
<s> Heathcliffe didn't howl.
<s> Where is he now?
<s> You're right, sir.
<s> A fair number, Ma.
<s> I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
<s> Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
<s> Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
<s> I think that's great, Milo. I do.
<s> Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
<s> Okay. I'm Gary.
<s> You know who.
<s> Lay it on me.
<s> Not for a moment.
<s> It's called Black Leather.
<s> '... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
<s> Nothing... Let's get crazy!
<s> Hey, do I know you?
<s> Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.
<s> "Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."
<s> Well do something about it.
<s> So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
<s> Always keep 'em laughing.
<s> What is your uncle's name?
<s> I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
<s> Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.
<s> Stop.
<s> I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
<s> That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.
<s> My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
<s> Everyone loves my father. He's a very likeable guy.
<s> What? No you're not..
<s> Test. Shit. What kind'a test you thinkin'? You mean like, if you a man or not? If you a killer? Only one way to prove that. You just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back.
<s> Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
<s> I'm not wearing his pants.
<s> Nobody.
<s> I'm doing it.
<s> No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
<s> Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
<s> Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
<s> What happened?
<s> Y-Yes my son.
<s> But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
<s> Careful. Check his pulse.
<s> As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
<s> Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
<s> I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
<s> I am trying.
<s> Yeah? Why?
<s> What friend?
<s> Digital laser readers.  Wow.  Terrific.
<s> Sure. Thanks.
<s> We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
<s> It's the truth.
<s> In the casino.
<s> Well, life's not fair. We know that.
<s> When?
<s> Wasn't that hard.
<s> Lauren's not my wife.
<s> How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
<s> Oh, yeah...?
<s> I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
<s> What did you say?
<s> I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
<s> No. That makes you keep searching.
<s> Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home.
<s> She's the winner and we're going to state.
<s> That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
<s> WHAT  ?
<s> Perhaps he will listen to you...
<s> And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
<s> We don't HAVE to help anybody.
<s> I know.
<s> Thank you.
<s> I don't care about rocks, I care about you.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
<s> I understand the business reasons.
<s> What a guy.
<s> Well...
<s> He was hot, wasn't he?
<s> I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?
<s> Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.
<s> A major!
<s> Just an observation.
<s> I'm fine! I'm fine!
<s> I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
<s> No, no, they're all dead...
<s> I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
<s> I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
<s> You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
<s> No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.
<s> Yes.
<s> The first female President?
<s> Quellek. What are you doing in there?
<s> But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
<s> Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over.
<s> Bring it on, dude.
<s> I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone.
<s> What did I do?
<s> You're hearing about somebody else.
<s> Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
<s> Waiter!
<s> What?
<s> What else?
<s> It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.
<s> I could take care of her.
<s> Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is.
<s> It's not your fault.
<s> You know me, boy.
<s> It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
<s> It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
<s> I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
<s> It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
<s> A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
<s> I don't drink, but you can go out.
<s> I know.
<s> Alone?
<s> Please. I can't bear it...
<s> What?
<s> Don't let them take me, Steve --
<s> I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
<s> The less exposure I recieve around government buildings the better.  You, as Mrs. Taupin, will attract considerably less attention than I.
<s> All living things pay dues, Conor.  They must be respected for that.
<s> American.
<s> What's the idea of locking this?
<s> Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
<s> Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.
<s> Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
<s> You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
<s> What?
<s> We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
<s> I did.  Hold the wire.
<s> It's like telling fibs.
<s> Out.
<s> Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
<s> Quiet.
<s> These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
<s> Firefly.
<s> Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.
<s> Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
<s> Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
<s> ...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
<s> Ounpoo. Ungh.
<s> You think I can lose?
<s> That's fine.
<s> I had a feeling you would.
<s> How long would their shields be down?
<s> But, Mr. President...
<s> He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!
<s> No.
<s> Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
<s> It's not your time. I get time off.
<s> Oh....Sure.
<s> Who are these people?
<s> It acts as a...
<s> Quite a little shopping spree. How do you spend six figures in less than six hours? Oh, never mind I've seen it before. I've seen everything.
<s> Excuse me?
<s> Heh heh.
<s> Outside!
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> There's a word - orders.
<s> That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered.  My statements...
<s> They're gonna love you, chief.
<s> No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
<s> If I were to tell you "no it isn't..."
<s> He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
<s> Sure.
<s> I told them.
<s> Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
<s> I'm walking, aren't I?
<s> Where are we?
<s> Let go!
<s> I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
<s> Sit down.
<s> God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
<s> The hull's imploding!
<s> They're back here.
<s> At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
<s> Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
<s> Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago!
<s> It's a whale out there.
<s> What's going on with the beaches, Chief?
<s> Well, you're lucky it's not you.
<s> Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.
<s> Yeah, but it sucks for free.
<s> Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls.
<s> But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
<s> Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games.
<s> Why did he what?
<s> Yes. It is today.
<s> You said nothing. You told me nothing.
<s> OK.
<s> Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
<s> Then come.  I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
<s> Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
<s> Precisely.  Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant.
<s> It's terrible.
<s> If that's what it takes.
<s> You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
<s> You're so predictable.
<s> He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
<s> You're not well.
<s> Don't even...I'm there.
<s> You can't go because of Sam?
<s> Oh my... I'll try.
<s> All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave.
<s> Wait-- listen--
<s> They're inside.
<s> On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
<s> Case #1108, previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
<s> Some -- somebody's father?
<s> They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
<s> Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
<s> Soho Grand, right?
<s> Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.
<s> I ain't said I'm ashamed.
<s> Allah Akbar.
<s> If she got eyes, she do.
<s> Your control over your children, therefore --
<s> For a year?
<s> No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
<s> Okay.
<s> Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...
<s> That's right.
<s> And get ourselves another touchdown to win.  I wish to hell we knew what they were plotting.
<s> Duke Forrest.
<s> You can cut the bow.
<s> I can try, sir.
<s> I got it all ready. Here.
<s> Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
<s> It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis.
<s> -- Waiter.
<s> I told you twenty!
<s> What do I play?
<s> What?
<s> Henry Hill.
<s> This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
<s> Office of--Senator Smith?
<s> Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
<s> You're more than that. I've had example of the fact that wild horses couldn't pull confidential matter in these two offices out of you. That's why I tell you what I do--about Smith and this situation. So, you see--
<s> John—
<s> Uh-huh.
<s> What exactly is it supposed to do?
<s> -- Which I don't necessarily agree.
<s> A little.
<s> Oh?
<s> I was mistaken.
<s> And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
<s> He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.
<s> Thank you.
<s> Hello.
<s> No, sir.
<s> I'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her.  Anything but a talk with her.
<s> I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
<s> The Rangers and DEA are heading out to the desert this morning. You gonna join 'em?
<s> Step out of the car please, sir.
<s> No. Do you?
<s> Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in.
<s> You do, I reckon.
<s> No sir.
<s> They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?
<s> To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
<s> I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
<s> I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
<s> She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
<s> How many more do we have after this?
<s> Fuck that, we've got company...
<s> You know I think Brother Judge needs our support right now, not our suspicion  This is beautiful man. Folks around here never read the truth like this before.
<s> No man. Gonna walk.
<s> It's already over.
<s> Is there quicksand?
<s> She let it escape because she wants me to die.
<s> Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
<s> I don't mind her if you don't.
<s> I'm glad.
<s> All right, all right! It's your funeral, Anne Schuyler!
<s> Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
<s> Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
<s> ... Sex.
<s> Oh, gosh no.
<s> Oh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you want to.
<s> You should go on a trip.
<s> Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
<s> Your Lisa?
<s> It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
<s> They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?
<s> He hates me.
<s> Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
<s> He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
<s> Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
<s> This is what he was doin'.
<s> In the grub box.  Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
<s> To the other side of the street.
<s> No, I'm fine.
<s> I've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.
<s> I'm afraid.
<s> But why come to me?
<s> Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings.
<s> I can't believe you did that!!
<s> She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
<s> OK. But late.
<s> We live in 703.
<s> But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?
<s> WITH LEGS LIKE MINE I'M REALLY MADE FOR DANCING
<s> A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
<s> My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
<s> I haven't done anything.
<s> Lucky.
<s> -- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
<s> Not, "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
<s> Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...
<s> That's happening in about ten minutes. Israel's at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can't wait.
<s> Human beings can die.
<s> I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
<s> Hey -- Comrade! Over here! This is Harry Shapiro -- the Volga Boatman of Barrack four!
<s> I wanted to save Geordi. I tried. But I experienced something I did not expect.  I believe it was fear.
<s> But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
<s> It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
<s> Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.  Data,lock onto that plasma coil.
<s> They've knocked out the damn automation center.  I've got no control over anything!
<s> Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
<s> Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa.
<s> But we can't just sit here -- !
<s> KHAN!
<s> A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
<s> The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
<s> No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
<s> Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.
<s> Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
<s> What?
<s> I didn't mean this future.
<s> Yes.
<s> Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
<s> Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
<s> A lie?
<s> That was another time.
<s> Aye, sir.
<s> When can we expect containment?
<s> Shermin!! Shermin!!!
<s> What for?
<s> It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.
<s> No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
<s> I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
<s> Slow down a second, you met with Low --
<s> You're an actor. Find the Zen in the role.
<s> Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs.  I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.  The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  I don't care if we all go down together.
<s> That's good.
<s> I think you're right.
<s> I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
<s> Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
<s> Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
<s> You can do it in my mouth.
<s> Would you like me to go for her?
<s> Seven o'clock then.
<s> I am sure.  I mean to report it. It's like Burke and Hare all over again.
<s> But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
<s> This is Michael.
<s> I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
<s> Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
<s> Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.
<s> It doesn't look all that different.
<s> Why "of course"?
<s> Louise, I'll do anything.  I know what's makin' you run.  I know what happened to you in Texas.
<s> Oh yeah.
<s> Fresno.
<s> Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
<s> Big time.
<s> Where's Puffy?
<s> What if I can't?
<s> ...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
<s> If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.
<s> They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
<s> That's right. Turn around.
<s> Like what?
<s> Tell me one thing.
<s> I'm late.
<s> I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet.  Now you tell me.  Is that worth three hundred measly credits?
<s> Damn straight!  Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing!
<s> Hey, I don't want spend the night out here!
<s> You don't get it, Pham.  The idea was: we were ripping you off.
<s> Sustained.
<s> A spinal injury, in the line of duty. It was in Kitty's report...
<s> ... An hour.  That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.
<s> We just discovered him, your Honor! His appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case! He is an inmate at Ossining Correctional and --
<s> James...
<s> You thought it was just.
<s> And ask me what?
<s> Would you like some coffee, General?
<s> I don't know.  A couple months.  Why?
<s> Chase, you'd better come home.
<s> What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.
<s> Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
<s> So?
<s> James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
<s> James, like it or not, they're your parents.
<s> K through sixth.
<s> I'm not that crazy.
<s> What did you do to them?
<s> How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
<s> I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
<s> You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
<s> Right now?
<s> After God... before the waste-paper basket.
<s> The one up on the third floor?
<s> I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
<s> Eh, there's only three of them.
<s> Me!
<s> Take care.
<s> Shit...
<s> Damn it!  How long to fix?
<s> Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
<s> It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd loves me, I love him!
<s> What?
<s> Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
<s> Finch, you got the Latin homework?
<s> Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
<s> I was all out of dynamite!
<s> THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
<s> Yes, you do. You do.
<s> Oh, I'm in her acting class.
<s> U-huh.
<s> Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
<s> Oh my God, the sitter.
<s> Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
<s> This is insanity.  Sally...
<s> He's my favorite.
<s> How long have you been married?
<s> Like your business managers?
<s> Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
<s> It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
<s> Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
<s> I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.
<s> You ought to see my backhand.  And wait till I serve the meatballs. 
<s> Yes?
<s> Hit by a swinging door? Or maybe a Yellow Cab?
<s> Where ?
<s> Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
<s> Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
<s> Why?
<s> He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
<s> What?
<s> He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.
<s> Thanks.
<s> It was the biggest I could find.
<s> You don't miss a thing.
<s> Your parents are divorced?
<s> What if you lost your keys?
<s> No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
<s> I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.
<s> Who?
<s> Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
<s> Know about it? I can practically see how they're doin' it. Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.
<s> You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
<s> There's a name from the past.
<s> Fine.  How's your back?
<s> Ignorant art?
<s> Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
<s> Too good?
<s> I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle.  And Interest Number One, is <u>moi</u>.
<s> Hello, Jason.  I think I've had a change of heart.
<s> Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
<s> God!  How old are you?  There ain't no bat.
<s> All aver the world.  They say he's spent half of his life overseas.
<s> It was nothing.  We're not ... He just makes me laugh.  When was the last time we laughed?  Any of us?
<s> Uh... I think you scared them off.
<s> Yup. Huh huh.
<s> That's my girl!
<s> I'm beeyoo-teeful.
<s> Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
<s> Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.
<s> Yes. That is surprising.
<s> Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
<s> She ain't crazy. She love those children. She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
<s> I want a child.
<s> What's your point, Dude?
<s> Sure.  That and a pair of testicles.
<s> I don't like it.
<s> Human?
<s> <u>Now</u> you can bring the vehicle to a stop: there on the left.
<s> It must be great.
<s> Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
<s> I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
<s> I want you to stay with me.
<s> I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
<s> Oh hey, one more thing?
<s> It's only the beginning.
<s> I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now.
<s> Cremated?!
<s> Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
<s> What are you going to do with it?
<s> 
<s> She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
<s> Thank you or calling Central Services. am sorry, due to temporary staff shortage, Central Services cannot take service calls centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours - have a nice day - this has not been a recording, incident-
<s> What is this?  Who the hell are you?
<s> Stressed? He's psycho.
<s> Mary said you might be coming.
<s> Crazy fucker.
<s> This conversation is not worthy of you.
<s> Right there, Bobbie.
<s> Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
<s> How can you say that to me?
<s> What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.
<s> N-no...
<s> That's really nice of you Mayolia.
<s> He looks wonderful, Jackson...
<s> Yep.  So how's Annie?
<s> Even if it's the Carolina League-- this is a chance to play everyday.
<s> 702 472 1862.
<s> It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know.
<s> I know, I should probably tell you, but I just don't feel like it. To be honest, I'm really angry at you. I admired you so much more when you were purely wicked. I mean, look at you now, running around trying to "get to the bottom" of things. Trying to "save the city." It's true we're about to do a very nasty deed, but really, what's it to you?  Since when do you care what happens to a bunch of pathetic Oasiburgians? You're just not yourself, anymore.
<s> But of course you are.
<s> I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  Get this door open!
<s> You won't disconnect.
<s> She's not that either.
<s> Never said a truer word.
<s> Some judge...
<s> Be careful, Peter.
<s> But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
<s> I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
<s> You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
<s> Oh, shit.
<s> Elvis is still in there!  It's gonna go off!
<s> ...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
<s> ...to be off the island tonight.
<s> INT. DARLENE'S STORE - DAY.
<s> Mr. Sweeney, how goes it?
<s> He must've had a damn arsenal in there.
<s> I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
<s> How are you, Mr. Thatcher?
<s> Persia.  It belonged to a king.
<s> You lie.
<s> I'm just kidding.
<s> We're not playing in the street.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Maybe.
<s> Why do you say that?
<s> Up ahead.
<s> Oh, good. For a minute I thought you'd lost your mind.
<s> The only faster way up is the East Face and it's smooth as glass.  Maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather, only a psycho would try it in a storm.
<s> Then go fetch.
<s> Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
<s> Prison custody?
<s> Now then. Face the wall. Bend over and touch your toes. Chief Guard inspects Alex's anus with a penlight.
<s> Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
<s> What am I gonna do with flowers?
<s> I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs?
<s> Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
<s> Any special reason?
<s> Truth'll set you free.  I'm listening.
<s> Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.  Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
<s> I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
<s> Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this.
<s> Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
<s> Go and look for a note.
<s> Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop...
<s> Home free.
<s> Open up.    I want to see.
<s> Relax. It will be fine.
<s> How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
<s> I will.
<s> I love you.
<s> I told you to lock the door.
<s> Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
<s> But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
<s> What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
<s> I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
<s> What?
<s> Well... you remember Cynthia?
<s> Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean...
<s> No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?
<s> No?
<s> Right.
<s> Kimberly!
<s> I was part of the escort team that re-animated him.  My partner's dead because of this guy.
<s> It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
<s> Yeah.
<s> They'd have a good neighbor, Jabez -- and that's worth much more than anything else -- much, much more!
<s> What about the kids?
<s> Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
<s> What are you talking about?  What do you think I'm doin'?  I'm gettin' the ball rollin'.  I'm keeping these people happy ... I'm keeping you happy ... I gotta keep the cops cooled out ... I gotta do everything ... I gotta pay for the pizza ... I'm workin' on it, do you know what I mean?  I'm workin' on it ... Jesus Christ!  I gotta do it all ... I got all the ideas ... you want me to give you the gun?  You want to take it over?
<s> You stopped?  Why?
<s> Motherfuck a window, Radio Raheem is dead.
<s> We all know you're gonna get over with the insurance money anyway! Ya know da deal.
<s> Gotta go.
<s> You and me? Dream on, desperado.
<s> Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say.
<s> Looks like the best man won.
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> "Oh, tract housing, huh?"  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
<s> He says --
<s> No. It's your fault.
<s> What?
<s> What's the dif --
<s> When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
<s> That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.
<s> No, sir.
<s> Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
<s> Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers.
<s> I don't believe it is, no.
<s> I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
<s> You gotta let me bring you in to the police.
<s> Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
<s> And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
<s> Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased.
<s> Bluebacks. I'm not bullshittin'. I swear to God.
<s> You.
<s> Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
<s> That's good.
<s> I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
<s> She'll get here.
<s> Good idea.
<s> ... Thanks.
<s> Retching and convulsing while those bastards didn't even try to save her sorry ass.  You gave her mouth to mouth -- man -- even then you had some constitution.
<s> Is that what you think?
<s> Frank.  Where’s Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
<s> I was in the city.
<s> Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
<s> Victor, are you feeling alright?
<s> What'd this guy look like anyways?
<s> He was killed in action.
<s> There's nothing to say, Tita...
<s> I don't think that's accurate...
<s> Hi.
<s> Spooky.  I'll process her.
<s> Jesus, how could you be so stupid?  Come on, we're going to a hospital.
<s> I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
<s> Can he trust you?
<s> No.
<s> Shut up.
<s> No, we're just...
<s> That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George.
<s> Will you get out of here.  Will you get out of here.  Will you.  I'm trying to run an office here.  Will you go to lunch?  Go to lunch. Will you go to lunch? 
<s> I'm going home.
<s> Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
<s> No Tom, just listen.  All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that.  One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.  I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him.  What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me.  And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary.  I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone.  I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent.
<s> I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
<s> Go wash glasses if you don't like it.
<s> Atley Jackson came to see me ...
<s> "Shadow games?"
<s> I know. I've missed you, too
<s> You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
<s> Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
<s> Yeah, yeah.
<s> --And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him!
<s> I don't know.
<s> Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
<s> Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
<s> What?!
<s> You!
<s> Go fix the phones.
<s> Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.
<s> Really?!
<s> We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...
<s> Or, perhaps...
<s> Orderly.
<s> I've come to see you, sir, about an Auction...
<s> I have not, I would <u>not</u>.  For life  life goes on Starling.  And, wait, wait, I wish to <u>talk</u> to you... I'm...    One moment.  I was <u>afflicted</u>, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter.  I was <u>afflicted</u> before. Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance. Do not  Do not curse God when you are humiliated.  Listen to me: <u>embrace</u> it, and you embrace <u>life</u>.... <u>Listen</u>, and you hear the word of <u>God</u>...
<s> Color me educated. I learned high school happiness is for members only, Pauline Fleming wouldn't know reality if it lived in her uterus, and reality's name's Heather James. Also, J.D.'s a major creep.
<s> They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!
<s> Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
<s> Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
<s> I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
<s> Why sir?
<s> Please, be quiet.
<s> Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
<s> As a tumor.
<s> I am.
<s> They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.
<s> Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
<s> Ti-Misery?  What's that?
<s> I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
<s> So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
<s> Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
<s> Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
<s> Paul? Yeah. You think --
<s> You know Libbets, I really feel, you know, like a real connection to you --
<s> Maybe we can just watch some TV.
<s> What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
<s> Paris? You came from Paris?
<s> What you wouldn't do. It's almost sunrise. It will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me. The sun or the fire!
<s> Carter –– bank examiner.
<s> Yeah . . yeah . . . maybe . . . maybe . . .
<s> Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
<s> Until we find something.
<s> No.
<s> ... I'll go to McDonalds.
<s> Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
<s> Stop busting my hump....
<s> Mom....
<s> My equipment doesn't crap out....
<s> Fine, I just --
<s> Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
<s> Baryonyx?
<s> Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
<s> What kind of park is it?
<s> Then its authority is in doubt.
<s> No, I'm look --
<s> Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --
<s> You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!
<s> Someone's been doing all these things.
<s> Billy, don't eat with your fingers.
<s> No, I did not.
<s> It happens when I land.
<s> They can survive winter.  As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive,  am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?
<s> Then do it!!
<s> No.
<s> Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
<s> General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
<s> "Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.  When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness."
<s> You screw around like that again and--
<s> Try that one.
<s> I can fix cars.
<s> Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. Danny Padilla from the Sentinel, that crowd.
<s> You think he killed anybody in Korea?
<s> Harry-?
<s> Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
<s> No, I thought it was funny. Forget it.
<s> You're right.  I must've made a mistake.
<s> That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
<s> What?
<s> It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
<s> What?
<s> Who was it?
<s> What's up?
<s> Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
<s> OK...where do you want to start?
<s> Where is he?
<s> How far away's the back-up?
<s> I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
<s> Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
<s> Are you sure?
<s> Charlie...?
<s> Yeah, so things'll be even.
<s> I am, too.
<s> I said get out.
<s> That's it.
<s> Can I ask you something?
<s> You said you were leaving town.
<s> Really?  So, what is this, a party?
<s> Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
<s> I had to lay eyes on you.
<s> Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
<s> I know.
<s> Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
<s> Manny...
<s> My pleasure.
<s> How do you suggest I go about it?
<s> Yes.
<s> You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?
<s> You don't vote for kings.
<s> I'll decide when it's exaggerated.
<s> It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
<s> We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
<s> I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...
<s> I bet your mom sang to you.
<s> WHAT?
<s> I know that, but what do you want from me?
<s> Hi.
<s> I wanna live with them too.
<s> But, I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...
<s> Yea.
<s> Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
<s> That dyin's gonna be done two ways.
<s> Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
<s> Yeah. On the section gang.
<s> ...Yeah, but the Hosaka's history.
<s> I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
<s> Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.
<s> It's an amazing gift.
<s> He's heavy in the halls...
<s> Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
<s> Anna Scott?
<s> I— I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's.  Yours is coming out at the elbows.
<s> Who is it?
<s> What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
<s> He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit.
<s> Gay movies.
<s> Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
<s> Get out of our way.
<s> I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship.
<s> Don't bother
<s> Shhhh!
<s> Nah...
<s> As I said before...
<s> What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.
<s> Do you think I was faking?
<s> I never notice the view after the first week.
<s> You didn't play it for laughs last night.
<s> They're getting better equipped every day.
<s> I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
<s> I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
<s> No. No. We have already succeeded.
<s> -- what? --
<s> Let me explain --  -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.
<s> Don't say another word, Valerie.
<s> Nobody's hearing nothing!
<s> Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
<s> Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
<s> It's all yours.
<s> I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
<s> I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
<s> I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
<s> Know what I love about dynamite?
<s> Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
<s> I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.
<s> I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.
<s> Whatever I got, I always got on the slide. This shot's no different. I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none.
<s> Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.
<s> Uh...C?
<s> He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.
<s> You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
<s> You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
<s> Go for a walk in Central Park --
<s> So what happened?
<s> How's it going?
<s> No. No. I can't. If Ramón ever found me on a picket line ...
<s> And you admire that?
<s> What?
<s> Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims.  I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.
<s> Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.
<s> Okay.
<s> I just can't have any social life right now.
<s> Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu thing’s been done.
<s> Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
<s> Her old boyfriend?
<s> It may be Maureen Reynolds --
<s> Absolutely.
<s> I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
<s> That all depends on you.
<s> He came to make up.
<s> For once, Stu, drop it.
<s> Hello.
<s> We're screwed.  He's fucking with us.
<s> Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  We've got pizza.
<s> The Divine Comedy.  A History of Catholicism.  A book called Murderers and Madmen.
<s> Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
<s> And I love poetry above all.
<s> Take another look at these two.
<s> I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
<s> Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing, so that I could have nothing --
<s> What are you talking about?
<s> Going where?
<s> Your advice!
<s> I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
<s> Okay, thanks.
<s> No --
<s> Yes, sir.
<s> You did what?
<s> Because we're
<s> Chosen me?
<s> Baptized? Well, get baptized then. I don't give a shit. Call a fuckin' preacher, goddamnit! I can't baptize you.
<s> Me, too.
<s> I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it.
<s> No thank you.
<s> Actually, I'm his father.
<s> It's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little.
<s> I used to smoke Raleigh cigarettes. They came with a free gift coupon in every pack.
<s> Fair enough. We wouldn't want to get carried away, would we?  Now call your aunt Em and let her know you're alive.
<s> Fight it.
<s> Look, if William Morris doesn't come through -
<s> I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
<s> Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
<s> Kat, we must talk. This guy, there’s something not quite right.
<s> He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.
<s> Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
<s> Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
<s> Then we've got to get to the lifepods!
<s> What's it look like to you?
<s> Now swing it out a little to the right...
<s> Storm?  What storm?
<s> Antihistamine.  For bites.
<s> Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
<s> I'm trying to keep balance with --
