alright .  if you guys don &apos;t want it to be special ,  fine .  you can throw any kind of party you want .

ya know ,  i mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion .  my sister &apos;s graduating from college ,  nobody thought she would .  it &apos;s a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a celica .

 hey ,  monica ?  can i ask you a cooking question ?  
chandler !   is he ?  
ooh - ohh !  
why ?  
well ,  you can &apos;t just not see rachel anymore ,  she &apos;s one of your best friends .  
that &apos;s true !  
thanks for the help ,  problem solved .    
 hey mon !  
see ,  there was kind of a mix up in my agent &apos;s office ,  but i &apos;m still on tv and that &apos;s good exposure .  
how many times have i told you guys ,  you never watch the cooking channel !  
hey !  
oh that was yours ?  uh ,  yeah ,  we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars .  
expect it in 4 - 6 weeks .   umm ,  hey ,  umm ,  joey &apos;s gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day ,  we have the whole place to ourselves .  
well i just ,  thought maybe you &apos;d wanna book some time with the best you &apos;d ever had .  
why ?  
 okay ,  that &apos;s it .  i cannot make this decision !  it is too difficult ,  so i &apos;m just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate .   
well ,  i don &apos;t know what else to do .  i mean ,  i either keep my wife and lose one of my - my - my best friends or i keep my friend and get divorced the second time before i &apos;m 30 !  so - so if anyone has - has a better suggestion ,  let &apos;s hear it !   &apos;cause i - i got nothing !  all right ,  don &apos;t be shy ,  any suggestion will do .   okay then .  here we go .  magic 8 ball ,  should i never see rachel again ?   ask again later .  later is not good enough .   ask again later .  what the hell !  this is broken !  it - it is broken !  
 look ,  maybe i got carried away before .  but there &apos;s something you gotta know .  if i &apos;m the best ,  it &apos;s only because you &apos;ve made me the best .  
i mean i was nothing before you .  call the other girls and ask .  which wouldn &apos;t take long .  but when i &apos;m with you ,  and we &apos;re together ,  oh my god .  
oh - aw my god !  now ,  i understand if you never want to sleep with me again ,  but that would be wrong .  we &apos;re too good !  we owe it ,  to sex !  
well ,  i was kinda hoping we could do this without him .   oh no - no - no ,  leave the gloves on .  
yeah ,  why don &apos;t we lose the gloves .  
all right ,  let &apos;s show them how it &apos;s done .  
okay .   
y &apos;know that wasn &apos;t part of it ?  
but it &apos;s dark out .  
i guess i &apos;ll get washed up then .  watch that sunrise .   
i know ,  me too .  hey !  y &apos;know what if we went away for a whole weekend ?  y &apos;know we &apos;d have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time .  
yeah ,  i can say that i have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing .  
okay ,  y &apos;know your not though .  let &apos;s go .   
oh weird ,  chandler just told us he &apos;s got a conference there !  
hey !  
is rachel here ?  i gotta talk to her .  
well look ,  i &apos;m just trying to focus on the  &quot; i get to see my wife ,  &quot;  part ,  all right ?  and not the part that makes me do this .   
oh yes ,  somebody just said ,   &quot; can you hear anything ?  &quot;   
 well ,  remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything ?  well ,  when ross said rachel at the wedding ,  i figured it was gonna happen again ,  so i hid this in here .  
oh god ,  it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine -  - teen blocks .  oh .   oh my god .  
 i can &apos;t believe it !  we &apos;re here !

monica .

mon ,  honey youre not dying .  im just moving out .  yknow ,  i mean were gonna see each other all the time .  
are you okay ?  youre not blinking .  
oh ,  all right .  but yknow i gotta say ,  i dont ,  i dont think six years counts as an era .  
what is the matter with you ?  !  
all right ,  fine ,  but dont get mad at me .  its - its just a little hard to believe .  
well yknow ,  its you guys .  you - you do this kind of stuff !  yknow ?  i mean ,  you - you were gonna get married in vegas and then you backed out !  i guess im not upset because i dont see you guys going through with it .  im sorry .  
but i 
it is ?  really ?  
 i mean were not ,  were not gonna live together anymore ?  
what ?  oh my god !  im gonna miss you so much !   
i mean its the end of an era !  
well ,  that would be great but then what do we do about denise ?  
i dont know !  how about ,   &quot; thanks for taking the message .  &quot;  jeez !   
sure !  
well ,  i like that idea .  obviously !  i was thinking maybe - maybe - maybe it could be a game room ,  yknow ?  i mean you can buy old arcade games like uh ,  like space invaders and asteroids for $200 ,  the real ones !  the big - big ones !  
okay so you mean no as in ,   &quot; gee chandler ,  what an interesting idea .  lets discuss it before we reject it completely .  &quot;  
so ,  thats it ?  
which is why asteroids is perfect !  its the oldest game !  
i dont have anything against the beautiful guest room ,  especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away !  
hi .  
hi ,  listen ,  im sorry about before .  i dont need to have a game room .  i mean when i was a kid i only played those games because i couldnt get girls ,  and now i can emnow ,  i have you .   not - not that i think that i have you or think of you as property in any sort of way ,  i see women 
really ?  
ohh .  
thats a great idea !  we can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room .  
we dont have to come up with this now .  
hey ,  yknow what ?  why dont we think about changes we can make in the living room ?  
yeah ,  i mean were gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair .   
is that a problem ?  
oh ,  thats cool .  then ill just bring them both over .  
okay ,  i get it .  so ,  i get nothing !  nothing here is mine !  everything here is yours !  ill get up in the morning put on your clothes ,  and head off to work !  
in the game room !  
whats all this about you guys fighting ?  !  is this really over a room ?  !  i mean ,  that is so silly !  
well ,  we are fond of the silliness ,  but we also have a soft spot for the love .  
thats laughter .  
and mon ,  you wanna live with chandler ,  dont ya ?  
so are you sure about this whole moving in thing ?  !  i mean its a really big step !  and - and whats the rush ?  !   
no ,  i - i - im serious ,  okay ?  i mean ,  think about it .  you move in ,  you start fighting over stupid game rooms ,  next thing yknow you break up !  
yeah ,  i &apos;m not so worried .  
fine !  its your life !   i just dont want to see you guys break up !  which you will do if you move in together ,   but thats what you want ,  theres nothing i can do .   dont do it !  !  !  !  !   
of course !  
scared me out of ever wanting to live with him .  
oh my god !  someones killed square man !  
oh thats so sweet !  i want to show you something too !  
yknow those big - big uh ,  road signs that say  &quot; merge ?  &quot;  
yknow ?  so i was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed .  because ,  thats you and i together !  merge !  
really ?  !  
so ,  which of this kitchen stuff is mine ?  
and ?  
 uh - oh ,  saved by the bell .   hello ?   
no - no ,  i bought those .  
yeah .   
 no - no - no ,  thats great !  ill be there monday .  and thank you again !   okay .   umm ,  that was the head of the paleontology department at n uh ,  y ,  uh u !  
hi .  
yeah ,  and i know you guys dont know a lot about psychic readings ,  but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get .  
monica !  
did - did you take these back ?  
oh yeah ,  theyre really great !  arent they ?  
 hello !  
hey !  
i knew all i had to do was let the material speak for itself .  everyones all ,   &quot; ross you have to be funny and sexy .  &quot;  well ,  i proved them wrong !  and now ,  im gonna pass the news onto joey and chandler .  
well ,  were a little early ,  the lecture doesnt end for 15 minutes .  
 im sorry ,  ive got plans with my sister .  
 right ,  will you excuse us for one moment ?   what are you doing ?  
no !  they are mine !  
you stole them from me !  !  
gimme them !   
well 
monica you really think i should try this phasing out thing ?  
really ?  really ?  !  
what ?  
 oh my god !  !  
na - uh !   hey did anybody lose their keys ?  
 oh ,  good ,  good ,  you guys are here !  listen ,  how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies ?  !  
 please !  please !  please !  please !  oh please !  please !  please !  frank and alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and im nervous cause ive never done that before by myself !  
yeah ,  im gonna pass .  cause i was kinda iffy when it was puppies .  
 im doing okay .  i think its going well .  do you think theyre having fun ?  am i talking to fast ?  
see thats where i think that youre wrong .  weve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense .  
okay ,  im a rookie .  i should not be in the end zone .  chandler adds the powder ,  begrudgingly ,  and monica puts the diaper on . ] 
the ones that got me the porsche !  will you keep up !   but i figured ,  if - if people keep seeing me just standing there ,  theyre gonna start to think that i dont own it .  so i figured ill wash it .  right ?  monica ,  you got a bucket and some soap i can borrow ?  
you dont even have a car !  
and ?  
i dont know why i was so nervous about this .  and i dont know why frank and alice are always complaining .  this is so easy .  
 check it out !  check it out !  when the babies wake up ,  they can meet krog !   
oh ,  look at little leslie stretching in her sleep .  
oh ,  i can still do that .  
 all right .   i thought about it and maybe youre right .  maybe krog is not a safe toy .  
well ,  i was trying to prove that i was right .  yknow ?  and it turns out i was wrong .  and now its lodged in my throat .   
no .  no ,  i just uh ,  i just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks i own a porsche .  
oh ,  ive been there .  yeah ,  i am gonna go drive my porsche .   
ahh ,  i think it just moved .  its really poking me .  
what ?  !  no ,  you cant ,  you cant leave me here with them !  were baby - sitting !  
but you - you cant leave me with them !  we - were a team !  were playing a zone !  theyre gonna triple team me !  
and protected them from a tornado ?   
i know ,  the babies are asleep .  
i did it !  i took care of the babies all by myself !  
was the setting of phoebes triumph .  
is not as important as the fact that phoebe took care of the babies all by herself .  
well that would help the pride thing .  
hey !  wow !  you look great !  wanna move in with me tomorrow ?  
okay !   so ,  what do you girls have planned for tonight ?  
and also ,  my birthday .  
 pheebs ,  i was wondering 
well and clearly not a minute sooner .  
well ,  what youre wearing is fine for that .

oh nope ,  i - i have plans with joey .

ohhhhhh ,  look its the roller blades .  
you remember when we got these ?  
im sorry pheebs ,  i guess im just really said that im leaving .  
well ,  this doesnt have to be so sad though .  yknow ?  maybe instead of just thinking about how much youre gonna miss each other ,  you should like think of the things youre not gonna miss .  
come on ,  theres gotta be something .  
good thats a good one .  okay ,  monica ,  anything ?  yknow ?  does rachel move the phone pen ?  
okay ,  good .  there you go .  doesnt anyone feel better ?

yknow ,  i know youre talking ,  but all i hear is ,   &quot; blah .  blah .  blah - blah - blah .  &quot;  
 yknow i think you can take her .  
yeah !  yeah !  that would be very helpful !  yeah .    
i was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior !  id really like it if we could be friends .

me too .  
ill see you .  
 or ill hear you .  
wait !   
pretty much ,  yeah .

monica ,  you remember me telling you that joke ,  right ?  
seriously ?  
 hey .  
oh ,  i want to look too !   .  yikes !  
oh ,  yeah ,  sure .  i mean ,  like in the case of this young woman ,  she has lost her clothes ,  so she rides naked on the horse ,  shes crying out ,  where are they ,  where are they ?  
you see ,  now ,  i would date this girl .  shes cute ,  shes outdoorsy ,  you know ,  and she knows how to build a fire .  i mean ,  thats got to come in handy 
 i dont know .  
rachel .  
 he took my joke ,  he took it .  
you know who else picked rachel ?  ross ,  and you know what else ross did ?  he stole my joke .  you know what ?  im going to get a joke journal .  yknow ?  and document the date and time of every single one of my jokes .  
yeah !  
picking rachel .  
maybe its the sound of ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts .  
 i finished my book .    
 hey ,  you guys .  
monica ,  what are you doing ?  
i guess it was kinda funny .  
fine .  the reason that i was leaning a little bit more toward rachel than you is just that youre just kinda high maintenanceokay lets go to lunch !  
oh my you think im a pushover .  well wait ,  watch this ,  you know what ?  youre not invited to lunch .  what do you think of that ?  i think thats pretty strong ,  thats what i think .  come on ,  monica ,  lets go to lunch .   
i cannot believe her .  
oh ,  oh ,  i love that japanese place .  
all right ,  wherever you wanna go is cool .  
no .  
you got it .  
okay ,  but i dont see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons .  
okay .  
yes ,  we are very sorry to tell you this ,  but you ,  phoebe ,  are flaky .  
yeah ,  totally .  
thats great .  good for you guys .  
okay ,  okay .  you have to help us decide whose joke this is .  
yeah .  
well each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truthme .  
okay ,  i thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with steve .

im not arguing with that .

 im out of words .  should i just say the whole thing again ?  
 youre a little high maintenance .  
im sorry .  youre not easy - going ,  but youre passionate ,  and thats good .  and when you get upset about the little things ,  i think that im pretty good about making you feel better about that .  and thats good too .  so ,  they can say that youre high maintenance ,  but its okay ,  because i like maintaining you .

you too ,  you let uh ,  your hair grow long .  
richard !  no one supposed to know about us !   see i ,  did it again .  
yeah ,  ill sit down .   
and - and then i sneak out and before monica can her parents come in .  
its so great seeing you guys again .  id like to make a toast .   uh ,  as a poet once said ,   &quot; in the sweetness of friendship ,  let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed .  &quot;  
oh you knew that .  good !  
yeah ,  i was but uh ,  she was a little busy with a water balloon fight .  
yknow ,  maybe she is too young for me .  yknow ,  when i was over there and she was running around with her friends ,  i felt like i was a baby - sitter .  i finally started to see what you guys were talking about .  i dont know what to do .  
okay umm ,  bad stuff .  well ,  im - im 12 years older than she is .  
hmm .  
okay ,  good stuff .  umm ,  well shes - shes sweet and pretty and 
no !  no !  i didnt do that .  its just okay ,  honestly no .  i dont ,  i dont see a big future with her .  
ohh ,  let me see it !  let me see your hand !   
eww !  oh ,  its all dirty .  you should throw this out .  
hey ,  being you is finally gonna pay off !   
yeah !  and also ,  a little like a french guy .   i never noticed that before .  
hey !  
 yeah ,  big brother .  
yeah ,  well yknow ,  it just got me thinking though ,  why would anybody ever want to get married huh ?  
eh 
hey monica ,  theres a customer who wants to complement the chef ,  should i let him in ?  
hi !  
actually ,  im not here to complement the chef .  
well ,  it was great seeing you the other night .  
i still love you .  and i know i probably shouldnt even be here telling you this ,  i mean youre with chandler a guy i really like ,  and if you say hes straight ill believe you !  after seeing ya the other night i knew if i didnt tell ya id regret it for the rest of my life .  letting you go was the stupidest thing i ever did .  
well yeah ,  im sorry .  i know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but i had to tell ya !  i wanna spend my life with you .  i wanna marry you .  i wanna have kids with you .  
i know this is crazy but am i too late ?  
well i know i was an idiot !  and i tried to forget you ,  i really did !  yknow after we had lunch last year i spent six months in africa trying to get you out of my head !  
working with blind kids .  
okay thats fine ,  ill walk away .  and ill never bother you again ,  but only if you tell me chandlers willing to give you everything i am .  
you are ?  
why ?  
sure i do .  in fact ,  i think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural .  i mean look at pigs .  lets take a second here and look at pigs .  okay pigs dont mate for life .  i mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime ,  and thats just an ordinary pig not even a pig thats good at sports !  
if marriage worked ,  id be all for it .  but do you know what the divorce rate in this country is ?  97% .  
well ,  never say never but yknow probably uh yeah ,  never .  
whoa !  whoa !  whoa !  what is all this pressure ?  !  is this some new kind of strategy ?  why dont you put down your copy of the rules huh mantrap ?  !  
hey monica !  
this is for my boat ,  pretty cool huh ?  
whoa - whoa ,  whats the matter ?  !  talk to the captain !  
chandler giving you a hard time huh ?  
well ,  you know chandler .  
maybe you changed ?  
maybe thats the problem .  
chandler is a complex fellow ,  one who is unlikely to take a wife .  
i dont know !   i havent totally decided how to talk on my boat yet .  
monica face it ,  chandler is against marriage .  and - and always will be !  
there are ?  
r - r - richard said he wants to marry you ?  !   and - and chandlers tellin ya how much he hates marriage ?  !  
chandler loves marriage !  !  
hi .  
i didnt ask .  you wanna come in ?  
oh ,  okay .  well ,  ill just leave the door open and go sit on the couch .   
 drink ?  
on the rocks with a twist ?  i remember .   
uh ,  no !  no !  thats art !  if it bothers you i can put my art out .  
so monica let me ask you a question .  yknow ,  since we broke up do you ever ,  think about me ?  
oh really ?  
who is it ?  
yeah hes no good .  do you ever  think about me in a  non - eye doctor way ?  
ahh .  
excuse me ?  
oh .   whew !  
yeah !  youre saying ,  you need to be with someone more mature .  maybe someone with ,  a license to practice medicine .  or a mustache .  
i think thats fair .  
its okay !  shh !  hey .  hey .   shhhh .  
i know .   
i am so sorry man .   
oh my god .   
okay !   okay !  okay !  oh god ,  i thought  wait a minute ,  i - i can do this .   i thought that it mattered what i said or where i said it .  then i realized the only thing that matters is that you ,   you make me happier than i ever thought i could be .   and if youll let me ,  i will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way .   monica ,  will you marry me ?  
yes .   
 can we come it yet ?  !  were dying out here !  
oh no wait no ,  this is wrong !  ross isnt here !  
where is she ?   
oh no ,  let her stay out there .  its sweet .   
its okay ,  i want this to be your night too .   to monica .

oh my god ,  the wedding book ?  !  i havent seen that since the forth grade !

now ,  do i get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding ?  
okay .  
centerpieces !  
definitely roses .   well ,  i just think theyre a little more weddingy .   but lilies are the clear choice .  
oh ,  i dont think i ever heard that story .  
what a sweet story .  
what ?  !  they wanted a scary story !  
you tell her jack ,  i cant do it .  
were sorry honey ,  but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 youd pay for it yourself .  
we started saving again when you were dating richard and then that went to hell ,  so we redid the kitchen .  
clearly i did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal .   
well what happened at dinner ?  
honey ,  its gonna be okay .  
look ,  why dont you just pay for it yourself ?

look ,  i understand ,  but i have to put my foot down .  okay ?  the answer is no .  
hey .

look ,  i thought about it too ,  and im sorry .  i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding .  
yeah ,  im putting my foot down .  yeah look ,  when i proposed i told you that i would do anything to make you happy ,  and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then ,  then thats what were gonna do .

yeah .  
uh ,  four ,  a boy ,  twin girls and another boy .  
well ,  stuff like whered we live ,  yknow ?  like a small place outside the city ,  where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff .  yknow ,  we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door .  of course ,  wed have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old .

oh ,  but he will .  he still tells the story how monica tried to escape from fat camp .  
then how did you get caught in the barbed wire ?  
if that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off !  
lets give it a shot .  
oh ,  what was that for ?  like a bake sale ?

46 .  wow !  who &apos;s well educated now ,  mr .  i - forgot - ten - states ?  
 all right .  don &apos;t look at my list ,  ross ,   &apos;cause there &apos;s a lot on there that you don &apos;t have .  
but the drawer full of take - out menus is okay ,  right ?  
pshhshhh !  
i don &apos;t know .  maybe it &apos;s because it smells a little weird .  it &apos;s like old pumpkins or something .  
which smells delicious !

oh my god !  that guy at the counter is totally checking you out !  
go for it .  
im just saying ,  get his number just in case .  but no an accident and cant perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill .  
op ,  can i just tell you something ?  very flattered but umm ,  im engaged .   talk to your friend .  
oh hey !  
oh ,  great !  we couldnt keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while yknow ,  hed kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck .   
 all i could think of was yknow ,   &quot; is he gonna kiss me ?  is he gonna kiss me ?  &quot;  
im a lady monica ,  i dont kiss and tell .  but this hickey speaks for itself .   
i just like him so much that i just feel like ive had 10 drinks today and ive only had six .  
you sound like a guy .  
bye !   we said good - bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love .  
 i miss you too !  !  !  !   
no .  why ?  
okay ,  dont sweat it .   chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system .  that guys cute .   
no ,  that is the last thing you want to do !  
because youre marrying him !  
all right ,  ive never been engaged and ive never really been married ,  but i can only tell you what my mother told me .  whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship ,  do not communicate them to your husband .  
that is correct !  yes ,  youre supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight .  
yes !  
okay .  well ,  i think the centerpieces are too big 
kinda .  theyre really big .  
what ?  
no .  no ,  see when i first meet somebody its uh its mostly panic ,  anxiety ,  and a great deal of sweating .  
sleeping with somebody new more sweating .  
i was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship .   look ,  for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives .  
well yeah !  but now that i know that youre having these thoughts ,  im back to panic ,  anxiety ,  and uh im definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink .  
well no ,  not yet .  but the audition went really good .  
they want me to be totally naked in the movie !  
hey ,  the wedding is so close !  are you getting nervous ?  
a no sex pact huh ?  i actually have one of those going on with every woman in america .  
sure .  
cassie ?  
wow ,  i havent seen her for ,  like ,  forever .  i wonder if she still carries that barbie everywhere she goes .  
 hi !  
yeah !  
what ?  !  
 well okaywell dont ruin it !  just play along at least !  
i dont know !  its not like its porn !  this is a serious ,  legitimate movie .  yknow ?  and the nudity is really important to the story .  
youre right .  maybe i shouldnt even go on the call back .  
well thats true .  and i am only naked in one scene .  plus it sounds really great .  my characters catholic and he falls in love with this jewish girl .  who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm .  so we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other .  its really sweet and - and tender .  
hey !  
yknow im - im really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding .  
yknow i was thinking if we had a a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours 
technically we could have sex again .  what do you think ,  bossy and domineering ?  !  
thats me !  come on !  
well ,  get rid of her ,  obsessive and shrill .  
nice to meet you too .  
yeah .   
whatwhy ?  
i was not staring at her .  okay ?  i was just listening intently .  its called being a good conversationalist .  watch .   say something .  
fine ,  she can stay at my place .  by the way ,  what - what does cassie even look like now .  
umm ,  so this aunt marilyn is - is - is - is she coming to the wedding ?  
nope .  
yep .  
thats right .  
i dont know !  i really want this part !  and they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes .  like if - if they want you to ride a horse ,  you tell em you can !  and just figure out how to do it later .  
i kn - i know !  i know !  okay ?  and apparently tomorrow when i go in to meet the_director i have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like .  
i just have to call my agent and tell her i cant do the part .   
unless what ?  
like what ?  
okay .  okay !  well okay ,  who do we know thats coming ?  me .  are you ?  
hey !  whats up mon ?

i dont know .  just uh ,  just tell em it was a mix - up with the invitations ,  orno - no - no !  blame it on the post office .  they hate the post office .  and the irish !  but i dont think you can blame it on them ,  so

okay ,  i can fix this !  okay monica ,  rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding .   
oh !  right .  umm ,  maybe thats because i didnt send him an invitation .  
i dont even know the man .  okay ?  were not that close .  i havent seen him in years .

look forget it okay ?  i dont want to go .  i dont want to see him .  i dont wanna .  
no - no all kids are embarrassed by their parents ,  youd have to come up with a whole new word for what i went through .  when i was in high school ,  he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different hollywood starlet .  yknow its hard enough to be fourteen .  youre skinny .  youre wearing speedosthat your mom promised that you would grow into !  and you look up into the stands and theres your dad cheering you on dressed as carmen miranda .  he was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack !  
he had sex with mr .  garibaldi !  
does it matter ?  !

no look ,  weve apologized twice !  i cant do anymore than that .  i know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it .  
why did you invite my mother ?  !  
eight weeks .  i mean i love my mother ,  but my god ,  a long lunch with her is taxing .  
youre right .  youre right .  i mean im about to have a baby ,  i can tell my mother that i dont want her to just be sleeping on my couch !  oh my god !  shes gonna want to sleep in my bed with me .  this cannot happen !  
okay .   
i have new respect for chandler .  all right everybody !  its time to open the presents !  
what ?  !  it goes ten times a day !  what are we feeding this baby ?  !  indian food ?  !  
okay .  while she is standing and rachel is sitting ,  seeing this monica decides to join in on the hugging by hugging mrs .  green from behind her back . ) 
no ,  not a thing .  
oh .   its like im not here ,  which i almost wasnt .  
nothing !  you have apologized to her like a million times and shes been nothing but terrible to you .  and dont forget you just threw her daughter a lovely ,  albeit slightly boring ,  shower ,  and she hasnt even thanked you for it .  
yeah i mean if you want to say anything to her ,  id tell her off .  
uh - huh !  
okay !  i will !  mrs .  green ?  mrs .  green !   it is rude to leave a party without saying good - bye to the host !  yeah ,  and - and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it !  now what i did to you ,  it wasnt on purpose !  but what youre during to me now is just plain spiteful !  
 wrap it up ,  wrap it up ,  wrap it up 
you were fantastic !  im so proud of you !

because that &apos;s who i am ,  okay ?  i &apos;m sure a mature man like richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn &apos;t bother him .  just &apos;d be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men &apos;s club over brandy and moustaches .  
this is about you and richard .  he &apos;s clearly not over you .  he keeps a tape so he can .  .  .  look at it whenever he wants .  
oh ,  yeah ,  well ,  poor richard .  y &apos; .  .  .  i can grow a moustache !

y &apos;know but they &apos;re right .  i &apos;m not a strong father - figure and i never will be .

i thought i heard a mans voice before ?

you know ,  its funny .  ive been practising the art of seduction as well !  hya !   
yeah .   its joey .

alright .  ive got a plan .  ill go down the fire escape 
hear me out ,  woman !  ill go down the fire escape ,  then ill wait for a while .  then ,  when i come back up the stairs ,  itll just be like i got back from tulsa .  then ,  joey and i will come in here and see that there is no guy in here .  
just gonna wait for a little while .  
well ,  youre forgetting about the time difference .   
thats right .  your husbands home ,  so now the sex can stop .   
joey said that youre in here with another man !  
whats he doing ?  
why do i smell mens cologne ?   
i guess not .

you kidding ?  you &apos;re the most beautiful woman in most rooms .  .  .   whoa !  whoa !  whoa !  what &apos;s going on ?  you and i just made out !  you and i are making out ?  
but we don &apos;t do that .  
how drunk are you ?  
 that &apos;s the perfect amount !  
okay !   
what ?  
i know .  
well ,  i have kissed over four women .   do you wanna get under the covers ?  
okay !   
it bodes well for me that speed impresses you .  
yep !  
count of three ?  
two !  
well i think it &apos;s safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined .  
so ,  are you really gonna go out with that nurse man ?  
y &apos;know ,  i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary .  .  .  well ,  i have ,  and the technical definition is ,  two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together .  but if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me ,  then we have to ,  y &apos;know ,  get you my original dictionary .  i am *so* bad at this .  
really ?  okay ,  so .  .  .  
y &apos;know ,  i sensed that i should stop .  so we &apos;re okay ?  
okay ,  all right ,  all right ,  all right !  okay !   okay ,  here &apos;s something ,  here &apos;s something blue and new .  
let &apos;s go !   
oh ,  okay ,  i have condom in my wallet that i &apos;ve had since i was twelve .  
i don &apos;t think so .  
 here just .  .  . take this .   
no ,  we &apos;ll - we &apos;ll bring it back !  just put it under your dress .   
ehh .  
look ,  i thought about it too ,  and i &apos;m sorry .  i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding .  
yeah ,  i &apos;m putting my foot down .  yeah look ,  when i proposed i told you that i would do anything to make you happy ,  and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy ,  then ,  then that &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do .  
eh ,  forget about the future and stuff !  so we only have two kids ,  y &apos;know ?  we &apos;ll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college .  
yeah .  
uh ,  four ,  a boy ,  twin girls and another boy .  
well ,  stuff like where we &apos;d live ,  y &apos;know ?  like a small place outside the city ,  where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff .  y &apos;know ,  we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door .  of course ,  we &apos;d have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old .  
sure you do .  
you sure ?  
i love you so much .  
wow ,  it really is !   
aren &apos;t we done with that ?  
hey - heeyyy  -  look at that ,  it &apos;s a christmas miracle !  
i never want to leave you again !  
turns out they can &apos;t fire me .  because i quit .  
 i have *not* thought this through !  
i know ,  i ,  i should have talked to you first about it .  
actuary .  .  .  no .  book - keeper .  .  .  no .  topless dancer .  .  .  (he looks down on himself ,  checking ,  then nods satisfied and marks the realized ?  you are the sole wage earner .  *you* are the head of the household .  i don &apos;t do anything  -  i &apos;m a kept man !  
hey !  
i &apos;ve got nowhere to go this morning .  i &apos;m unemployed !  i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m gonna do with my life .  
i mean ,  what am i supposed to do with myself ?  
but it &apos;s all so overwhelming .  i don &apos;t know where to start .  
hey !  this is where your hyper - organized - pain - in - the - ass stuff pays off !  
how long was i in there ?  
wait .  advertising !  that &apos;s a great idea !  
i don &apos;t think i have to hear the rest .  advertising makes perfect sense .  sorry you had to waste all this time ,  though .  
i mean ,  i can write slogans .  i mean ,  how hard can it be ,  right ?   &quot; cheese .  it &apos;s milk that you chew .  &quot;   &quot; crackers .  because your cheese needs a buddy .  &quot;   &quot; a grape .  because who can get a water melon in your mouth ?  &quot;  
honey ?  leave it to the pros .  
 &quot; the phone .  bringing you closer to people .  .  . who have phones .  &quot;  
 good - bye .  
yeah ,  and i was really hoping that i could hang out .  what do you feel like doing ?  
i don &apos;t feel like having sex .  maybe we can watch a movie or something .  
oh ,  yeah .  but you have to give it back if i get a job .  of course ,  by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we &apos;ll all be wearing silver jump suits .  
here &apos;s an idea .  you walk into a room .  .  . take a quick scan !  
oh god ,  i have to tell you something .  you &apos;re not pregnant .  
that thing that i have to do to make a baby .  i faked it .  
oh yes you can .  you just make the faces and the noises .  
that &apos;s actually why .  look ,  i &apos;m starting a whole new career now ,  and i &apos;m not saying that i don &apos;t want to have a baby ,  i &apos;m just saying maybe we could wait a little while .  
or a year ?  
it could be less than a year .  i mean ,  you &apos;ve heard my stuff .   &quot; pants .  like shorts ,  but longer .  &quot;   it &apos;ll probably be more than a year .  
yeah ,  me too .  look ,  i &apos;ll just get my old job back .  
i quit and you learn what i do ?  
i guess .  it &apos;s always gonna be scary when we have a baby .  
should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind ?  
oh ,  and i promise ,  i will not fake it this time .  
sure .   
i wasn &apos;t staring .  i was leering .  
looks like joey is doing allright with her .  
bye 
fine .   
oh ,  please ,  i don &apos;t care about you enough to bug me .  in fact ,  from now on ,  i &apos;m going take the high road .  and i &apos;m going be very very nice to you ,  you  &quot; momma &apos;s boy &quot;  ,  starting right now .   
hi !  
pleased to meet you .  
why did you invite him ?  ?  i can &apos;t stand that guy !  
hey ,  mr philips ,  nice suit !  
 i still can &apos;t believe you invited gavin .  allright ,  he is the last person i want to see .  
god ,  i hope he doesn &apos;t show up .  of course he &apos;s not gonna show up ,  the guy hates me .  
what ?  
oh ,  ok ,  thank you .   do you see what all the guys see in her ?  
oh  .  .  .   happy birth  .  .  .   oh ,  see you later  
ahhhh  ,  you brought rats to my birthday party ?  
hi .  thanks for the party ,  honey .  should i help you clean up ?  
yeah ,  i just get a little bummed when my birthday &apos;s over .  
yeah ,  hey .   
well ,  it was ,  and you would have seen it if you didn &apos;t showed up at   .  .  .  ?  ?  god !  oh ,  this party was lame  .  .  .  
oh ,  uh ,  well ,  i haven &apos;t seem it but if i do i &apos;ll let you know .  
on how far along he &apos;s in the sex change process !  
oh before i forget ,  are you coming to mike &apos;s piano bar tonight ?  
but everybody sings .  it &apos;s so much fun !  last time this adorable old man got out there ,  forgot all of the words ,  flipped out and everyone booed him off the stage .  so funny .  
oh !  what &apos;s the matter ?  are you scared ?  you &apos;re afraid i &apos;m a better singer ?  you &apos;re afraid i &apos;m gonna beat you at singing ?  
ok fine !  please come and support mike .  you don &apos;t have to sing .  
while drinking .  .  .  
oh my god .  
yeah .  it was after the party ,  we were on the balcony and .  .  .  
it was the end of the party ,  you were probably ironing wrapping paper .  
you know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and ,  oh and he gave me this scarf .  .  .  
you know honey ,  there is a thin line between love and hate ,  and it turns out that line .  .  . is a scarf !  
i don &apos;t know .  it &apos;s so complicated .  i work with this guy ,  you know ,  i have the baby ,  and i have ross ,  and i just .  .  . i don &apos;t know what to do and i have to be at the office and see gavin in ten minutes .  
hi hi .  .  . oh you have got to sing .  
but you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice .  
all the time when you &apos;re cooking .  
yeah you &apos;re always singing  &quot; yummy yummy yummy ,  i &apos;ve got love in my tummy &quot;  
ok so isn &apos;t there a little part of you that wants to get up there ?  
well i &apos;ve got a book around .  .  .  
all right ,  that was kenneth with his much too literal rendition of  &quot; i touch myself &quot;  .  coming up next we &apos;ve got monica singing  &quot; delta dawn &quot;  .  
just pretend they &apos;re not even here !  it &apos;s ok monica ,  when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won &apos;t see anyone anyway .  
like an x - ray .  bad day not to wear a bra .  
every little bit of you !  
mon &apos; ,  not that you didnt sound good ,  but .  .  .  
i am sorry i am late .  youll understand when youll see joey .  
really ?  in front of all this people ?  
yes ,  she gives the people what they want .  
all right ,  watch !  
i gotta stop this .  
hey !  
i was just asking  &apos;cause i need someone to watch emma tonight .  
well ,  phoebe set me up on a date .  
why ?  what &apos;s the big deal ?  
well ,  i think it &apos;s great that you &apos;re going on a date ,  you know ?  i mean ,  it sounds healthy .  i mean ,  you have needs .  embrace your womanhood !  
so i &apos;ll bring her by around seven ?  is that okay ?  
no ,  no ,  no ,  no !  no ,  no ,  no ,  no !  it &apos;s okay ,  it &apos;s okay .  i didn &apos;t go .  don &apos;t cry ,  it &apos;s just a bit !  i &apos;m your uncle chandler; funny is all i have !   
i &apos;ll try to stop .  wait ,  did you say until the sixth ?  
today is the sixth .  
yes ,  it &apos;s also 2003 .  
it &apos;s okay .  go take the test and see if we &apos;re okay .  
tough crib .  
i might have checked to see if i was ovulating a couple times .  
oh ,  good ,  because as of four o &apos;clock this afternoon ,  i am not .  
i  -  i don &apos;t think i can .  
because of emma .  
sorry .  
well ,  she &apos;s aware when we leave the room .  she may notice if we start .  .  .  canoodling in it .  
well ,  i can &apos;t say  &quot; hump &quot;  or  &quot; screw &quot;  in front of the b - a - b - y .  
horrifying ?  scarring ?  something people go to jail for ?  
you guess i &apos;m right ?  when we stayed at that bed and breakfast ,  you wouldn &apos;t have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window .  
she &apos;s asleep .  chandler ?   
emma was doing it !  
ooh ,  she &apos;s asleep ,  that means we can .  .  .  
i think we may have really done it this time .  
where &apos;s emma ?  
don &apos;t ask me ,  i was in there canoodling you !  
okay .   
oh my god ,  this is the worst date ever !   rachel sorry ,  but did you really think that this was going well ?   what &apos;s up ?  
no .  
oh my god ,  then .  .  .   
what ?  what do you mean ,   &quot; there you are &quot;  ?  where was she ?  
because you two were having sex !  
no ,  no ,  no .  
hey ,  i gotta !  unless .  .  .  
uh ,  ah ,  monica &apos;s pregnant ?  !  
thank you .  i got a job in advertising .   
you know ,  if i didn &apos;t already have a job ,  i think ,  i would have been really good in advertising .  
 hey !  
where &apos;s chandler ?  i wanna wish him good luck on his first day .    .  .  .  and i smelled bacon .   
 i did ?  
oh my god ,  that is great !  that is *** for a play on broadway and in a real theatre ,  not that little one underneath the dally like last time .  
yeah ,  yeah ,  and directing .  
 you saw that ?  
 i know .  when the monkey hits him in the face with that giant rubber phone .   
well ,  they wanna see me again this afternoon ,  but ,  err ,  well ,  lennart haze did not like me .   
well ,  he said i wasn &apos;t urgent enough ,  you know ,  and that everything i did was horizontal and i should be more vertical .  oh ,  and he said that i should think less .  
 honey ,  i &apos;m old !  
i am so much older than these other interns .  i can &apos;t compete with them .  
wooooooooow  it &apos;s like they &apos;re on fire !  
what am i supposed to do with these ?  
well ,  first of all ,  they &apos;re not called  &quot; sneakers &quot;  anymore .  apparently ,  they &apos;re called  &quot; kicks &quot;  or  &quot; skids &quot;  and i think i heard somebody say  &quot; slorps &quot;  .   roll around  &apos;cause ,  apparently ,  walking is too much exercise .  kids ,  kids ,  roll your way to childhood obesity !   would you help me try to sell these ?  
hey ,  you &apos;ll never guess what just happened phoebe and i got mugged !  
 yah ,  because phoebe knew the mugger !  
you wanna know how she knew him ?   because phoebe used to mug people .  
well ,  i &apos;m not proud of it ,  but ,  you know sometimes when i was living on the street and i needed money for food and stuff i 
well ,  ok ,  i wasn &apos;t rich like you guys ,  ok ,  i didn &apos;t eat gold and have a flying pony i had a hard life ,  my mother was killed by a drug dealer 
 okay 
why ?  
yeah ,  it was pretty traumatic .  i was outside st .  marc &apos;s comics you know ,  i - i - i was just there minding my own business ,  you know ,  seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week -  
i know !  and - and the worst part was they took my backpack which boy &quot;  
a superhuman thirst for knowledge .  
okay ,  i think we have a problem here .  
well ,  uhm ,  back in my mugging days ,  you know ,  i ,  uhm ,  i worked st .  marc &apos;s comics .  
well ,  a pipe was my weapon of choice and ,  uhm ,  pre - teen comic book nerds were my meat .  
well ,  there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said -  
hey !  
probably wanna know what i &apos;m doing  ?  
 hey ,  uhm ,  phoebe didn &apos;t by any chance mention that 
i see .  you didn &apos;t happen to tell 
did you see our bank statement ?  can this be right ?  
i &apos;m not sure what they did ,  but i &apos;m inclined to blame enron .  
maybe i should quit and get a job that pays .  
you know what ?  you know what ?  i think we &apos;re making too big a deal out of this .  ok ?  so we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things .  and maybe we start eating out of joey &apos;s refrigerator for a change .  you &apos;re chef .  .  .  what can you make out of backing soda and beer ?  
no !  we &apos;re not borrowing money .  
because we don &apos;t do that .  we are bings !  and if there &apos;s one thing my father taught me was .  .  .  well to always knock before going into the pool house .  .  .  but the other thing was never borrow money .  
hey !  
i &apos;d be lying if i said i haven &apos;t thought about it myself .  chandler is my best friend ,  it would be wrong .  good .  .  .  .  .  . but wrong .  
aww ,  i don &apos;t know monica y &apos;know .  .  .  erm .  .  .  lending friends money is always a mistake .  
and i think he would tell you it was a mistake .  
oh .  .  . how much ?  
two thousand dollars !  ?  what do you think i am ?  i soap opera star !  ?  
oh .  .  . baby - proofing .  .  .  why is this such a big deal now ?  y &apos;know ,  when i was a kid it was like .  .   &quot; whoops !  joey fell down the stairs !  &quot;  or er .  .   &quot; whoops !  joey electrocuted himself again !  &quot;  huh !  
monica .  .  . would you please tell joey that he is a pig ?  
i know it &apos;s so exciting !  you know i &apos;ve never lived with a guy before .  
yes dear .  
uh huh .  .  . we &apos;re playing you two .  
i can &apos;t believe you guys are moving in together .  that &apos;s ,  that &apos;s great !  i mean .  .  . i &apos;m happy for you guys .  .  
yeah !  you bet roomy !  
boob job .  
hi !  
don &apos;t look at me i never get his jokes .  
oh no .  . don &apos;t thank me .  thank you .  you know there &apos;s not one thing i would change about you ?  not one single thing !  and definitely not .  .  .  two .  .  .  single things .  
no no !  i just love the way you look ,  i am warm ,  for your form .  
well yes yes .  .  .  you look nice can mean that your face looks nice .  i want to compliment your body .  i mean .  . i wouldn &apos;t change it .  at all .  and more specifically ,  i wouldn &apos;t want anything to get any bigger .  
just when you thought that dude couldn &apos;t get any wierder .  
i don &apos;t know !  i mean ,  what brought that on ?  
no you really think that &apos;s what it is ?  
hey rach !  ah .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  perfection .   wouldn &apos;t change a thing .  not a thing .  
yeah ?  
but honey you don &apos;t have to .  
argh .  fascist 
they .  .  . do that ?  
god why why would you want to do that to yourself !  ?  
because she is !  
i &apos;m so sorry pheebs .  
hi .  
ok .  i mean i know i did the right thing .  you know ,  mike never wants to get married and i shouldn &apos;t be in a relationship that has no future .  .  .  but .  .  .  pretty soon i &apos;m gonna miss him so much .  i &apos;m gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that .  
 unless .  .  .  maybe it &apos;s too crazy about this .  .  .  alright so .  .  .  you know ,  there is no future .  .  .  but that doesn &apos;t mean we still can &apos;t have fun .  you know what ?  forget what i said .  
that was a test and you just failed .  
because i told everyone he slept with dinosaurs .  
would you get that please ?  people have been calling to congratulate me all day .  
hang up ,  hang up .  and that was a great movie !   i &apos;m so gonna get back at ross .  .  .  oh yeah ,  this will show him ,  here we go  .  
god ,  i wish mike were here .  
okay if mike were here what would the two of you be doing ?   
i gotta call him .  just to talk to him ,  there &apos;s no harm in that .  
here .  
okay  
yes .  
yes ,  it reminds me of a simpler time .  
phoebe ,  where &apos;s your purse ?   
you can &apos;t have it .  
no  
 oh yeah .  
phoebe come here  
you know ,  it &apos;s a lot less surprising to do that after i &apos;ve buzzed you into the building .  
those are my shoes .  
monica ,  i really appreciate you checking in on me ,  but i &apos;m actually feeling a lot better .  yeah ,  i just kinda want to be alone right now .   
what are the chances ?  1 billion chinese people and they send mike !  ?  
phoebe called me .  
i &apos;m sorry ,  i broke down .  .  .  i wanted to see him .  
there is a speakerphone on the base unit .  .  .  
look ,  if i wanna see phoebe and she wants to see .  .  .  
oh !  sorry ,  i guess i was thrown off by the mention of my name !  
not if nothing happens .  why can &apos;t .  .  .  why can &apos;t we just hang out as friends ?  
sit down .   
 so how &apos;ve you been ?  
thanks ,  you look good too .  
i &apos;ve missed you too .   
 
it can &apos;t be any harder than this .  .  .  i mean ,  if i had known the last time i saw you would be the last time ,  i .  .  .  i would have stopped to memorize your face ,  the way you move ,  everything about you .  if i had known the last time i kissed you would have been the last time .  .  .  i never would have stopped .

no ,  you didn &apos;t .  
ok ,  we &apos;re taking that paddle home ,  mister .

god ,  you &apos;re amazing .  .  .  i didn &apos;t even have to ask you to call me that .  
oh that tart .  .  .  floozy .  .  .  giant .  .  .

i think .  .  .  .  i think i can see your scalp .  
i thought so .  
you go back to work tomorrow night ,  right ?  
so if you want people to see them ,  then by definition you &apos;re not having them taken out .  .  .  say ,  at the break of dawn ?  
what are you singing ?  
it &apos;s  &quot; ride of the valkyries &quot;  from  &quot; apocalypse now &quot;  .  .  .  hair problem .  and now that we &apos;re home ,  we don &apos;t have that problem anymore ,  so if you think about it .  .  .  i hate them !  
did i ?  let &apos;s refresh .  i believe what i said was that i could see your scalp .  
again ,  let &apos;s journey back .  .  .  as i recall what rachel said ,  was she had never notice the shape of your skull before .  and joey .  .  .  well ,  joey didn &apos;t realise that there was anything different .  
hit yourself in the tooth ?  
honey ,  you &apos;ve been in there for a long time .  .  .  is everything okay ?  
not really .   
really ?  what happened ?  
you can &apos;t move at all ?  
if i untangle you ,  will you please get rid of the corn rose ?  
 some of these look a little frayed .  
now that i untangled you ,  how  &apos;bout you doing a little something for me ?  
i think you know .  
this is what i want to do .  
hey guys !  
you know ,  it &apos;s funny .  every time you say  &quot; triplets ,  &quot;  i immediately think of three hot blonde 19 - year olds .   
hey ,  what &apos;s all this stuff ?  
ooh ,  babies !  oh ,  this one is so cute ,  get this one !  
oh ,  how does it work ?  
well ,  if you &apos;re having a hard time ,  you should talk to my friends ,  bill and colleen .  they adopted a kid .  i &apos;m sure they &apos;d help you .  
good to see you .  
hi frank .  
oh ,  my goodness ,  they &apos;ve all gotten so big !   
i mean ,  you have a lovely home .  
it &apos;s pretty much all the information you need .  
everything is broken down into categories ,  and then cross - referenced ,  and then colour - coded to correspond with the forms in the back .  
you want me to wash my hands first ,  don &apos;t you ?  
i would have told him to do it too .  
where are bill and colleen ?  
we have to leave !  !  
i didn &apos;t get to the bathroom .  i bumped into owen on the way ,  and he didn &apos;t know he was adopted .  and there &apos;s a slight chance i may have told him .  
hey .  
owen didn &apos;t know he was adopted ,  and monica told him .  
 hey !  
eh ,  you got a spray - on tan ?  
so ,  do you get colours or just french tips ?  
hey pheebs !  
oh ,  you won &apos;t believe who moved back to town .

ugh ,  let &apos;s just cut her out !  
cut her out of our lives !  just ignore her calls and dodge her  &apos;till she gets the point !  
oh ,  yeah .  could be rachel asking if someone could baby - sit again .  
hello monica .  its amanda calling again .  i am in the neighborhood hoping i can pop by your flat !  
hang on ,  shes right here .   someone &apos;s on the phone ,  for ya .

 how do you count to five ?  
well ,  it wasn &apos;t just me ,  alright ?  he freaked out too !  he couldn &apos;t even undo my bra !  
i do not know what &apos;s wrong with us ,  i mean ,  we have kissed before and that &apos;s been great !  but this time it was leading somewhere and i was very aware of the fact that it was joey touching me .  
 no need !  !  problem solved ,  we are powering through  .

well ,  it was 1992 ,  and i remember because that was the year i had sex with evil knievel  .

well .  .  . kinda .  
yeah well ,  in america you &apos;re just an  &quot; ass &quot;  .   
 oh my god .  was mike with him ?  
 soldier down !    
oh chandler !  thank god you &apos;re alive .  monica ,  can i talk to you outside for a minute ?  
it was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy ,  okay ?  you were really controlling and compulsive and shrill .  
you &apos;re also so generous and kind and scrappy !  
exactly !  look ,  no matter what i tried to do ,  i couldn &apos;t keep you out of my life .  of all the people i have cut out ,  you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in .  
yeah ,  you are .  and i &apos;m so glad that you fought your way back in ,  because i don &apos;t know what i would do without you .  
i won &apos;t know what i would do without you .   
honey ,  i got us that room at the woodford inn this weekend .  
we &apos;re having a party .  
c &apos;mon you guys ,  this is really important to us .  
and i mean ,  you know ,  you guys .  .  .  this is a big deal .  i mean ,  how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle !  
fine ,  but if we end up not doing this maxim thing because of this party .  .  .  
yeah ,  but for a one - year - old .  what &apos;s the point .  .  .  the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup .  just a cup with a picture of elmo on it dressed as a farmer .  and he &apos;s standing next to this cow and the cow says  &quot; el - moo &quot;  !   yeah .  .  .  that &apos;s a funny cup !   
look ,  i know that you guys really want to get to vermont and this isn &apos;t a really big deal to you ,  but it really is to us ,  ok ?  emma will never have a first birthday again .  
no really ,  she didn &apos;t sleep well last night ,  so we can &apos;t wake her up .  
 hey !  
which one are you ?   
i know ,  what are we gonna do ?  
oh ,  you &apos;re gonna love this cake .  i got it from a bakery in new jersey ,  corinos .  
well ,  anyway ,  they make these great novelty cakes ,  in all different shapes ,  and if you give them a photo ,  theyll copy it in icing !  
hey mon ,  that was really nice of you to loan rachel your car so she could go and get the cake .  
hi emma !  it &apos;s the year 2020 .  are you still enjoying your nap ?  
we used to be married ,  but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled .  because of you !  happy birthday .   
you guys ,  just please .  .  a little bit longer .  i promise ,  rachel will be back with the cake any minute .  monica ,  remember .  .  the frosting ?  huh ?

oh !  i got it !  ok ,  everyone pick a number from one to ten .  alright ?  whoever gets the highest number gets to go first .

i &apos;m too excited !  
come on robot !   
 what are you barking at ?   
yeah ,  see you later !   
some can sing ,  some can dance .  i apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures .  rachel and joey &apos;s apartment .  chandler ,  monica and emma are sitting on the floor ,  and emma &apos;s stuffed animals are lined up in front of them . ] 
i &apos;m sorry ,  is this a game for emma or for monica ?

i was kidding .  
oh good ,  i didn &apos;t miss the party .  
oh !  .  .  .  oh and emma ,  look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly !

i doubt that !  tell her about us last year .  
well ,  thats what i said ,  but it turns out ,  mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night !  
she &apos;s right !  if i were a guy and .  .  .   did i just say if i were a guy .  .  ?  
oh ,  i don &apos;t know ,  i don &apos;t know ,  isn &apos;t that a little desperate ?  
oh ,  i don &apos;t think it was desperate ,  i think it was amazing !  
ok ,  ok ,  so how should i do it ?  
 uuuh !  !  how about at a footlocker ?   
 can any of you watch emma ?  
great ,  i &apos;m finished !  in fact ,  i just dropped it off at the agency .

it &apos;s ok ,  it &apos;s ok .  you know what ?   i &apos;ll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter .

hey you know what ,  this kid needs me ,  okay ?  she needs to have a cool fun aunt !  
oh !  
 hey !

am i ?  really ?  am i ?  well ,  why don &apos;t you cook thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong !  well ,  think about it ,  think about it ,  you &apos;ll be trying to top than you did last year .  you &apos;d be in competition .  .  .  with yourself .  
don &apos;t let yourself get manipulated this way !  
oh ,  yeah ,  happy needless - turkey - murder day .  
you &apos;re not making the pies yourself ?  
did you at least win the contest ?  
can &apos;t wait !  
why come all the way from kansas to do that ?

somebody is gonna pick us .  
i &apos;m telling ya !  it &apos;s gonna happen .  next year it &apos;s gonna be you ,  me and the little hemingway bing .   what ,  he &apos;s my favourite author !  
  &quot; the firm &quot;  ?  
you know ,  you always cook this meal all by yourself .  let me help this year .  
i &apos;m serious ,  let me do something ,  just not the turkey or the stuffing ,  nothing  &quot; high profile &quot;  .  
tell me more .  
 they &apos;re out there !  
 everything is so distorted !  looks like joey has a giant hand !  which says  &quot; rangers &quot;  on it .  they went to the game !  
 ross &apos; shirt is torn .  
alright ,  come on .  .  .   alright ,  you guys .  we &apos;re so sorry we &apos;re late .  please let us in ,  so we can have dinner together .   
yeah ,  and there &apos;s a bowl of cranberry sauce that .  .  .   what happens to cranberry sauce ?  
i had a dream once about a fax machine that did that .    
oh yeah !   
ha - ha !  all you got was monica &apos;s stinky brussels sprouts !  
the cranberries .  .  .  ?  
the floating heads do make a good point .

uhm ,  we &apos;ve got turkey grease .  
i just wanna say that i &apos;m sorry i referred to the vein as a seperate person .  .  .   
okay .  
it isn &apos;t working .  
interesting .  .  .  
 oh ,  i left them on my bulldozer .  .  .  i don &apos;t have tools !  
i left them at the park .  
nice !   
 look !  look !  look what the .  .  .  look what .  .  .  look what the floating heads did !  
what &apos;s going on ?  
and ?  
are you serious ?   
i &apos;m so happy for you !  
i know .  have you considered pageanting ?  
hey !  
oh ,  right !  your adoption interview !  
and so incorrect !  
uhm ,  thank you ,  but we &apos;re really trying not to get our hopes up .  
but just think ,  ok ?  what if everything goes right ?  what if this woman does pick you guys ?  
so we &apos;re standing firm on the  &apos;not getting our hopes up &apos; ?  
yes ,  but .  .  .  
will back in a moment with erica .  
yeah .  just weird ,  you know .  it &apos;s like i &apos;m chandler .  may i have the human growing inside you ?  &quot;  
you &apos;re gonna be great .  
well .  .  .  obviously !  i &apos;d like you to meet erica .  
gosh ,  you know ,  you &apos;re just such an amazing couple .  it &apos;s .  .  .  kind of intimidating .  
 i don &apos;t think that &apos;s exactly .  .  .  
yeah ,  i read some great applications ,  but then i thought who better then a minister to raise a child !  
plus i thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor !  
reverend ,  can i ask ?  does the bible say anything about adoption ?  
i was wondering you both have such serious jobs .   would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock ?  
actually ,  i dont think we have to .  
yeah ,  when i read about you two ,  i was pretty sure i wanted you ,  but i just thought we should meet face to face .   .  i &apos;ve made my decision .  i choose them .  
yeah ,  i did .  
we are not signing those papers .  
it &apos;s wrong .  they made a mistake .  they think we &apos;re somebody else .  
you have gotta stop !  
she likes doctor chandler and reverend monica .  
your veal chop is $34 . 95 !  
but we are not the one she chose !  how can you feel okay about this ?  
i know .  .  
oh ,  honey .  .  
monica ,  i want a baby too ,  but this woman is giving away her child .  she deserves to know who it &apos;s going to .  
so ,  we &apos;ll tell the truth and who knows ,  maybe she &apos;ll like us for us .  
you &apos;re jewish .  
hey .  an open adoption .  there &apos;s a lot to go over ,  but i &apos;ll explain everything as we go through it .  
yeah .  it &apos;s a sonogram they took of the baby last week .  i thought you might want to see it .   
well ,  our names really are monica and chandler .  we &apos;re from new york .  
so you lied to me before ?  
i can &apos;t believe this .  
giving you my baby ?  you think i &apos;d give you my child after this ?  
you still want that baby ?   
my god ,  get a room !  
if you had to ,  what would you give up ,  food or sex ?  
 seriously ,  answer faster !  
hi !  
i was in the car with nancy all day .  
well ,  at least the perfume is not mine ,  be thankful for that !  
its perfect .  its everything weve been looking for .  
and the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps ?   what were the things you said ?  
and the fireplace in the bedroom .  
this is bringing out a lovely color in you !  
i dont know .  what do you think ?  
i do too .  
i know .  
i dont know what you mean ,  giant talking cigarette !  oh ,  by the way ,  phoebe called just as i was getting into nancys car ,  so if she asks you ,  i was at work all day .

thanks so much for showing me around .  
yeah .  .  .  it &apos;s almost definitely him .   
no ,  he &apos;s in prison .   
i &apos;ll bet his dad doesn &apos;t think so .   
of course i &apos;m awake .  assume from now on that i &apos;m always awake !   
honey ,  it &apos;s us .  of course it &apos;s the shovel - killer .  
i &apos;d keep an eye on him !  we have to find out which one the father is .  
i dunno ,  aren &apos;t there tests for these things ,  right ?  
o - okay .   so ,  is she gonna take the test ?  
oh god .  it &apos;s shovely - joe ,  isn &apos;t it ?  
oh god !  what was it ?  the thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do ?  
yeah ,  i don &apos;t know why we hang out with married couples more often .  
 hey ,  you guys .  .  .  i have great news .  
ooh ,  italian !   
 guess what ?   i finally got that seed out of my teeth .  
hey mon ?  was it weird changing your name to geller - bing ?  
where did you go to do it ?  
you never did it !  
no ,  thank you .  
but no ,  it &apos;s not close .  you said it was in escrow ?  i couldn &apos;t even find it on the map .  
damn it .  
okay !  
hey !  
oh ,  not anymore .  i changed it today .  
that &apos;s what we were gonna name the baby .  
uh !  princess consuela .  
uh - huh !  
well ,  my boss was at the same restaurant where i was having my interview and he heard everything .  so later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he &apos;s gonna have to let me go ,  because i &apos;m not a team player .  and i said  &quot; wait a minute !  yes i am .  &quot;  and i had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact .  .  .  was true .  
but also knowing it means a lot .  
take as long as you want .  just let me know when you &apos;re through .   
fungus !  yeah .  place is full of it .  
okay .  then i guess i have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason .  
maybe .  so this is the living room huh ?  ooh ,  it &apos;s pretty dark .   
 maybe .  well ,  i just think you guys can do better than this house ,  you know ?  or any other house for that matter .  
fine ,  ok ,  if you love this house so much ,  then you should just live here ,  okay ?  i just hope you get used to that weird humming sound .   hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm .  .  .  
hey .  
that &apos;s not funny !  you know i &apos;m afraid of little girl ghosts !  
hey ,  is rachel here ?  
she &apos;s still at dinner ?  
we ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her .  but i know he just wants to get into her pants .  
excuse me ?  
for your information ,  i was staring at her baby .  we &apos;re about to be parents .  
what ?  no ,  no ,  no !  no ,  no .  .  .  no .  .  .  no ,  no .  .  .  no ,  too much is changing ,  okay ?  first ,  phoebe getting married  congratulations !   .  .  .  and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs .  .  .  
well ,  rachel moving to another country ?  not being able to see her every day .  how can i be okay with this ?  
do you think if the ralph lauren people offered her her old job back ,  she would take it ?  
i don &apos;t know .  i could talk to her boss .  yeah !  i met him at that christmas party .  we really hit it off .  
we close escrow tomorrow ,  so seeing another house can only confuse us ,  and we &apos;re easily confused .  we &apos;re not very bright .  
you &apos;re kidding !  
yeah ,  she was just an agent .  
well ,  we cannot tell joey about this .  he &apos;s already flipping out about everything that &apos;s changing .  this will push him over the edge .  
well ,  not for a little while .  let &apos;s just give him a few days to get used to everything else .  
oh ,  sure .  im showing it to someone else right now ,  but please ,  look around .  
it feels like were cheating on our house .  and if were gonna cheat ,  shouldnt it be with like a hot ,  younger house ,  that does stuff that our house wont do ?  
so ?  what do you think ?  
well ,  we already have one offer on it ,  and i think the lady upstairs is goning to make another one .  
 don &apos;t ,  don &apos;t !   
 why !  ?  
this can not be happening !  
the only way that that is going to happen ,  is if the other couple are the hitlers .  
that is a great idea !  and by the way ,  i don &apos;t mean to sound distasteful ,  but when did you start crapping money !  ?  
alright alright ,  we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house .  we can still get out .  
will we love it so much with her next door ?  and she &apos;s gonna be louder out here too .  just the crickets and   &quot; oh my god &quot;  !  
oh ,  that sounds good !  
it &apos;s all done !  
i know .  .  .  honey ,  seriously ,  i did it all .  the luggage that i &apos;m taking is in the bedroom ,  this is emma &apos;s paris stuff ,  these are the boxes that i &apos;m having shipped ,  and that &apos;s the sandwich that i made for the plane .  .  .  
oh ,  well .  everything that i need  is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that i will be needing them .  
what ?  maybe i put it in here  .  oh ,  oh ,  it &apos;s not in there !  oh ,  no !  i must have packed it in one of these boxes !  
i know .  
hey ,  well ,  in a couple of weeks i won &apos;t be able to travel .  
hotel ?  why isn &apos;t she staying with you guys ?  
erica ,  those things aren &apos;t free .  in fact they have one of the highest mark - ups of any consumer product .  .  .  
oh man ,  i can &apos;t believe you guys are leaving this place .  
no ,  no .  this will always be your place .  it would be too sad .  plus ,  how much a month does it cost to feed joey ?  
hey ,  is chandler here ?  we talked about catching a movie .  
mhm ,   packing  -  sexy cheerleader comedy .  
we &apos;re taking a break !  
jumping on the bed ?  
hey !  
rock on !  wow ,  this is quite a spread !   what is all this stuff ?  
now it just hit her that she &apos;s leaving and she &apos;s kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off ,  ok ?  
no ,  no ,  no .  it &apos;s ok .  i &apos;m gonna be fine .  
oh ,  yes .  i decided to leave these out for you in case richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play !  
oh yeah ,  right !  good luck getting another scarf dance from me !  
really ?  then what are they doing in our guestroom ?  
rachel .  .  .  with handcuffs !  interesting !   
ok .  monica ?  
can you come here with me for a minute ?  
 are you wearing waterproof mascara ?  
mon .  .  .  okay .  .  .  i &apos;ve gotta .  .  .  just say what it is i &apos;m gonna say .  .  .  none of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years ,  would have happened if it wasn &apos;t for you .  no - one has been more like a sister to me .  .  .  
 i wouldn &apos;t know what i &apos;m gonna do without you .  .  .  
 
i .  .  .  i .  .  .  i .  .  .   
oh ,  you &apos;re definately not .  i haven &apos;t cried like that in years .  
unbelievable .  she says goodbye to everyone but me .  
you know ,  maybe she was just really spent from our talk .  it was pretty intense .  
ross ,  if you &apos;re this upset ,  you should go and talk to her .  
all right ,  i think i &apos;m gonna head out .  
i thought i was going home to go to bed ,  but i &apos;m sensing there &apos;s something less fun for me to do here .  
oh ,  yeah ,  yeah ,  good idea .   
 you couldn &apos;t be cool .   
okay ,  we &apos;re gonna start in the kitchen .  plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box .  the silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped .  got it ?  
hey mon ,  i think i figured out whose handcuffs they are .  
well ,  i was cleaning out the closet and i found some pictures of them .  .  .  being used .  
monica &apos;s grandmother .  
oh ,  it was okay .  i went to a movie with my cousin and then out for dinner .  we went to this place that had .  .  .  ooh .  .  .   hoo .  .  .  ooh .  .  .  anyway ,  they had these really amazing cheeseburgers .  
yeah ,  you know ,  maybe i ate too much .  i keep getting these stomach aches .  they come and go like every few minutes .  
relax !  we just get her some antacids .  
yeah ,  you got to get to the hospital .  
you can do this .  just breathe .  
 ooh !  are you sure ?

next time ,  can i say breathe ?  
no ,  i &apos;m okay .  
where are you going ?  
you can &apos;t leave me alone with her .  
this is exactly the kind of social situation that i am not comfortable with !  
it &apos;s just that we &apos;ve never spent any time ,  you know ,  alone together .  
the baby &apos;s head is crowning .   
i &apos;m okay .  
start pushing .  here we go .  here come the shoulders .  .  .   
he &apos;s just fine .  
well ,  that &apos;s spongy .

the next baby should be along in a minute .  
well ,  gosh .  that makes me feel so special and good .  
yeah ,  it &apos;s here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in ohio .  
i don &apos;t think so .  although ,  they did mention something about two heartbeats .  but i thought that was just mine and the baby &apos;s .  they kept saying both heartbeats are really strong ,  and i thought well ,  that &apos;s good  &apos;cause i &apos;m having a baby .  
what do we do ?  
 twins !  twins !  !  
uh - huh !  join me ,  won &apos;t you ?  !  okay ,  what do you say we keep one ,  and then just like have an option on the other one ?  
why not ?  we could give each of them half a medallion ,  and then years later ,  they &apos;ll find each other and be reunited .  i mean ,  that &apos;s a great day for everybody .  
what if they &apos;re not ?  what if it &apos;s adopted by a king ?  
monica ,  we are not ready to have two babies !  
okay .  
we &apos;re going to take erica to recovery now .
