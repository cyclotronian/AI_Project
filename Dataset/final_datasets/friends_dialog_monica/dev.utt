oh god .  .  .  well ,  it started about a half hour before the wedding .  i was in the room where we were keeping all the presents ,  and i was looking at this gravy boat .  this really gorgeous lamauge gravy boat .  when all of a sudden -  sweet  &apos;n &apos; lo ?  -  i realized that i was more turned on by this gravy boat than by barry !  and then i got really freaked out ,  and that &apos;s when it familiar ,  but .  .  .  anyway ,  i just had to get out of there ,  and i started wondering  &apos;why am i doing this ,  and who am i doing this for ?  &apos; .   so anyway i just didn &apos;t know where to go ,  and i know that you and i have kinda drifted apart ,  but you &apos;re the only person i knew who lived here in the city .  
ooh ,  i was kinda hoping that wouldn &apos;t be an and are trying to figure out what is going on . ] 
look daddy ,  it &apos;s my life .  well maybe i &apos;ll just stay here with monica .

i &apos;m sorry ,  i didn &apos;t catch your name .  paul ,  was it ?  
a wandering ?  
here &apos;s a little tip ,  she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red .  
i know ,  i know ,  i &apos;m such an idiot .  i guess i should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week .  i mean ,  how clean can teeth get ?  
well ,  you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers ,  say her -  
 that &apos;s one way !  me ,  i -  i went for the watch .  
ooh ,  steer clear of you .  
ever since she walked out on me ,  i ,  uh .  .  .  
no ,  it &apos;s ,  it &apos;s more of a fifth date kinda revelation .  
isn &apos;t there ?  
well ,  ever - ev -  .  .  .  ever since she left me ,  um ,  i haven &apos;t been able to ,  uh ,  perform .    .  .  . sexually .  
it &apos;s okay .  .  .  
two years .  
so you still think you ,  um .  .  .  might want that fifth date ?  
listen ,  while you &apos;re on a roll ,  if you feel like you gotta make like a western omelet or something .  .  .   although actually i &apos;m really not that hungry .  .  .
