<monica> it &apos;s that terrible ?  
<monica> me ?  what are you talking about ?  nobody could steal me from you .  i mean ,  just because i &apos;m friends with her doesn &apos;t make me any less friends with you .  i mean ,   you &apos;re my .  .  . we &apos;re ,  we &apos;re .  .  . oh ,  i love you .  
<monica> look ,  i know that you &apos;re in a place right now where you really need to hate julie &apos;s guts ,  but she didn &apos;t do anything wrong .  i mean ,  she was just a girl who met a guy ,  and now they go out .  i really think that if you gave her a chance ,  you &apos;d like her .  would you just give that a chance ,  for me ?  
<monica>  i &apos;d do anything for you .   
<monica> so how was joan ?

<monica> wow !  play that message for emily and this whole problem goes away !  
<monica> man ,  i would be great in a war !  i mean ,  i really ,  i think i would make a fantastic military leader .  i mean i know i would make general way before any of you guys .

<monica> first of all um ,  i love you both so much and youre both so important to me

<monica> if phoebe were my maid of honor 
<monica> rachel would be phoebes ,  i would be rachels ,  that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset .  
<monica>  well thats the best part .  umm ,  you guys get to decide !  
<monica> because then i dont have to !  
<monica> im really not deciding !

<monica> lewis posin !  he was my best friend in fifth grade ,  and - and then one day i asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no .  do you know why ?  
<monica> no !  but because he thought i was too faaaaa  .   and every time i think about it ,  it makes me feel as bad as i did in fifth grade !  yknow ,  i - i really think that you should apologize to julie .  
<monica> no ,  i know .  but yknow what ?  it would make me feel better if lewis apologized to me .  
<monica> its pretty clear .  
<monica> why dont you just stop doing stupid things ?  then you wouldnt have to apologize .  
<monica> all right ,  i i have to ask .  
<monica> are you gonna break up with me if i get fat again ?  
<monica> well ,  you broke up with julie grath !  how much weight could she have gained ?

<monica> why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it ?  
<monica> is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache ?  
<monica> isn &apos;t that sad ?  i mean ,  can you see how pathetic that is ?  you shouldn &apos;t be jealous .  you should feel bad for him .  
<monica> chandler ,  this is not our problem .  we &apos;ve got each other .  that &apos;s all that matters .  
<monica> cowboy boots ?  i &apos;ve never worn cowboy boots in my whole life !   
<monica> that &apos;s not me !

<monica> that was me .  
<monica> ok .  .  . listen er .  .  . i know that you &apos;re having a little bit of a family crisis but you don &apos;t have to take it out on the plates !  in fact i think ,  that ,  everyone ,  should erm .  .  . cut their food like this !   now ,  see ?  this way you protect the plates ,  and let &apos;s face it .  you have fun .  
<monica> that &apos;s not how you see me is it ?

<monica> why don &apos;t you take ross ?

<monica> what are you doing here !  
<monica> great !  
<monica> listen phoebe .  .  .  
<monica> you know how much i love listening to your music ,  you know ,  but .  .  .  
<monica> this is kind of a classy place .  
<monica> yeah .  
<monica> let me think .  oh ,  when i was younger i used to dream that i got married to mayor mccheese ,  and on our wedding night i ate his head .  
<monica> wow ,  do you mean like kiss him - kiss him ?  
<monica> what do you think brought than on ?  
<monica> a love scene ?  with who ?  
<monica> olivia ?  i thought she was marrying connor !   oh right ,  real life more important .  
<monica> i don &apos;t know .  i mean ,  you saw him do a love scene ,  so maybe you don &apos;t have a thing for joey ,  maybe you have a thing for drake .  
<monica> of course it was !  trust me ,  when it comes to psychology i know what i &apos;m talking about .  i took two psych classes in college .  
<monica> it was hard !   
<monica> oh .  .  . phoebe ?  maybe i wasn &apos;t clear before .  i really love listening to your music here ,  but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place .  
<monica> phoebe ,  it &apos;s not what you wear .  it &apos;s sort of your songs .  .  .  i just don &apos;t think you should play at the restaurant anymore .  
<monica> i didn &apos;t say your songs were not good enough .  
<monica> tiny portions ?  
<monica> phoebe ,  it &apos;s not about quantity .  
<monica> oh really ,  you want to talk about quality ?  have you heard of a key ?  it &apos;s what some people sing in .  
<monica> ok ,  so that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .  you know ,  when i &apos;m in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs ,  i &apos;m wearing ear plugs .  
<monica> you know what ?  i take back what i said before .  you keep playing at the restaurant ,  because with your music driving people inside ,  my bar sales are going up like crazy .  
<monica> thank god ,  it &apos;s just you !  i thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall .  
<monica> ok ,  you have to stop playing now .  
<monica> oh yeah ?  ok ,  let &apos;s settle this ,  come on !

<monica> yeah ,  and we &apos;ve paid for a room ,  that we &apos;re supposed to be in right now !  
<monica> no !  no !  let &apos;s figure out a fair way to decide who &apos;s staying .

<monica> thank you !   
<monica> yeah ,  it &apos;s just we don &apos;t think of you as really being so much  &quot; with the words &quot;  .

<monica> wow !  don &apos;t you look nice ?  !

<monica> alright ,  what was this sentence originally ?   
<monica> hey joey ,  i dont think we can use this .  
<monica> well ,  because you signed it baby kangaroo tribbiani  .  hey ,  why dont you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself !  
<monica> oh ,  well ,  i bought chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song .  
<monica> oh my god ,  mike was gonna propose ?

<monica> thank you .  
<monica> how about at a game ,  on the big screen ?

<monica> you hand - wrote it ?  
<monica> oh my god ,  oh my god ,  that letter is gonna go in our file !  we &apos;re never gonna get a kid .  no ,  we &apos;re gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds !  
<monica> okay good .  
<monica> ugh ,  we &apos;re screwed ,  aren &apos;t we ?  you know what ?  just tell me on the way to the bird store .  
<monica> what ?

<monica> well ,  of course i do .  what &apos;s not to like !  i &apos;ll take her in a minute !  but ,  you know ,  i think that you &apos;re giving up too easy ,  honey .  i think that you need to fight for her !  
<monica> absolutely !  yes ,  you say to him  &quot; i &apos;m sorry mike i can &apos;t live without her ,  she means too much to me !  &quot;  
<monica> damn it ,  i did not think this through !

<monica> wow ,  what &apos;s the bad news !  
<monica> huh !  
<monica> you know ,  i would give her up ,  for you .  
<monica> but i want to .  
<monica> but i insist !  
<monica> no ,  that landed in your food !

<monica> and it has to go perfectly ,  because if she doesn &apos;t like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state .  
<monica> ok ,  so i think i &apos;m just about done here ,  unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere ,  like .  .  .  porn or cigarettes ?  
<monica> chandler ?  
<monica> ok ,  so there &apos;s not a magazine under the couch ,  or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank ,  or a filthy video in the vcr ?

<monica> c &apos;mon chandler ,  i think we have been given an opportunity .  i mean ,  the mistake has already been made .  they are writing up the paper right now .  
<monica>  because .  .  .  we may not be who she thinks we are but no - one will ever love that baby more than us .  
<monica> i mean ,  who knows how long it &apos;s gonna take for someone else to give us a baby ?  what if ,  what if no one ever picks us ?  
<monica>  please .  .  please ,  we are so close .  
<monica>  okay ,  right .

<monica> look ,  doctor !   look ,  before we sign anything we really have to talk .  .  .  we &apos;re not who you think we are .

<monica> well ,  we .  .  .    &quot; bore false witness &quot;  .  .  .  see i could be a reverend .  
<monica> but we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider .  .  .  
<monica> well ,  you don &apos;t have to decide right now ,  but if you could just look at our file .  .  .  
<monica> god bless you chandler bing !  commercial break
