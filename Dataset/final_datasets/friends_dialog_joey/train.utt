all right .

why scott doesn &apos;t want to sleep with me .  it &apos;s  &apos;cause i &apos;m not sexy enough .  
really ?  that &apos;s so sweet .  i mean ,  i &apos;m officially offended but ,  sweet .  
 hey joey .  
how come you &apos;re watching a rabbi play electric guitar ?  
so ,  scott asked me to come over for lunch today and i did .  
and we did .  
yay me .  
well ,  i finally took your advice and asked him what was going on .  
he said that ,  um ,  he understands how sex can be like ,  a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that i was gonna get all ,  y &apos;know ,  like ,   &apos;ohh ,  is he gonna call me the next day &apos; and ,  y &apos;know ,   &apos;where is this going &apos; and ,  ya know ,  blah - la - la - la - la .  so he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious .  
yeah ,  so i said ,   &quot; okay ,  relax please ,  &quot;  y &apos;know ,  i mean ,  sex can be just about two people right there in the moment ,  y &apos;know ,  it &apos;s ,  if he wants to see me again he can call and if not ,  that &apos;s fine too .  so after a looooot of talking .   .   .  i convinced him .  
um - hum .  
and ,  uh ,  and then i kissed her .  
yeah .  
 there are no jobs .  there are no jobs for me .  
there &apos;s an ad for a naked chef ?

and then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest ,  and ,  and his stomach !  
and then right ,  right when the scene ends ,  he could take her with this raw ,  animal .  .  .  .

you should &apos;ve seen the look on her face .  i don &apos;t want rachel to hate me !  i don &apos;t know what to do .  
yes !  please !  
that &apos;s okay .  
that &apos;s not advice !  
i &apos;m going to the bathroom .   
 hi !  
look ,  i know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and ross but y &apos;know ,  i &apos;ve been obsessing about it all day and i &apos;d just love not to talk about it .  all right ?  
oh my god ,  its happening .  it &apos;s already started .  i &apos;m kip .  
 do you even know who kip is ?  
kip ,  my old roommate ,  y &apos;know we all used to hang out together .  
 hey !  
yes that was mine .

i know that too .  
yeah ,  it &apos;s in there .    
joey ,  can i talk to you for a second ?   
oohh !  !  ohh !  oh - oh - oh !  oh - oh !  !    
yes .  yes .   
yes ,  but you cannot tell anyone !  no one knows !  
it happened in london .  
the reason we didn &apos;t tell anyone was because we didn &apos;t want to make a big deal out of it .  
please ?  please ?  !  we just don &apos;t want to deal with telling everyone ,  okay ?  just promise you won &apos;t tell .   
i know ,  it &apos;s great !   
count in our heads as - as good madlibs .   
uh - huh !

i &apos;ll take it all .  
oh my god !  you got off easy !  when my friend silvie &apos;s husband said someone else &apos;s name in bed ,  she cursed him and turned his thingy green .   
now calm down joey .  
look ,  i &apos;m not happy about this either ,  but y &apos;know if - if ross says he &apos;s happy then we &apos;re just gonna have to keep our feelings about emily to ourselves .  are you cool with that ?  
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m gonna do about this coat .  
that might work !   
 no - no - no ,  it &apos;s just a bit sudden .   no ,  it &apos;s great .  okay ?  i &apos;m totally on board .  i love you too ,  all righty .  bye .   
well ,  her thought is ,  and i agree ,  fresh new furniture ,  why not a fresh new apartment ?  her cousin has this great place to sublet ,  it &apos;s got a view of the river on one side and columbia on the other .  
now that &apos;s so funny ,  because last christmas i got the gift of space .  we should get them together and make a continuum .   
 yeah ,  i - i - i just pulled the tab and i just fogged his yeti ass !

i &apos;m really gonna miss this apartment .  y &apos;know ,  ben - ben took his first steps right over there .   
i loved this place !  to tell you the truth ,  i wish i didn &apos;t have to move .  
well ,  i mean if uh ,  if emily gave me a choice 
why ?  
what &apos;s going on ?  
no ,  ross ,  we do not hate emily .  we - we just ,  we just think that you &apos;re having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy .  
look ,  we just think that maybe she &apos;s being a little unreasonable .  
oh ,  i know .  
kind of ?  if you just kept this to yourself none of this would &apos;ve happened .  
y &apos;know what ?  i &apos;m really not in the mood .  
 you &apos;re kinda stepping on the song .   
you do ,  huh ?  
what are you talking about ?  
ross ,  i 
okay .  okay .  joey ,  it &apos;s okay .  settle down .

 yeah ,  well ,  y &apos;know umm no honey ,  listen i think it &apos;s a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them ,  but i think the way you do it is y &apos;know you meet someone ,  become their friend ,  build a foundation ,  then you ask them out on a date .  don &apos;t hit on your existing friends !  
yeah .  yeah .  oh ,  but once you find it ,  ohh it &apos;s so worth the wait .

i &apos;m sorry ,  i thought you were joey &apos;s other grandmother .   i &apos;ve done it again .  
she &apos;s my biggest fan .  yeah ,  she &apos;s the only one in the family that &apos;s believed in me .   
oh ,  umm ,  okay ,  yeah ,  i &apos;ll be ,  yeah i &apos;ll be right back .    
because i lose her stuff !  rest of the episode takes place in monica and rachel &apos;s apartment .  why are they called apartments when they &apos;re all stuck together ?  something to think about . ] 
okay ,  see that blind guy right there ?  i &apos;m gonna bash his head in later .   
okay ,  but there is a big difference .  you are a lot hotter than i am .  
okay that is the one we already have !  
what ?  
 well ,  what is it ?  
 maybe your scene &apos;s coming up ?  
 yeah .  
 this is terrible ,  what are you going to do ?  
 that &apos;s not good .  
 if we keep talking this way ,  aren &apos;t we gonna freak her out soon ?  
soon ,  soon ,  i &apos;m gonna be on soon .  there i am !   
all guys that are awake .  then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way .  
joey !  this is like the last commercial .  you &apos;ve got like  ten minutes left !  
no !  you are not gonna run out and leave her here !  
yay !  
almost over man .  
why am i looking ?  
oh ,  here i am ,  here &apos;s my big scene !   
 all right back off !  i gotta gun !  i &apos;m not afraid to use it !  
you couldn &apos;t have at least changed your shirt .  
oh no !  
 ground control to major tom !  commencing countdown engines on !   
okay ,  guys ,  listen ,  don &apos;t forget that tomorrow is the day that emily gets married again ,  so whatever we do ,  just try to really keep ross &apos;s mind off of it .  
 oh ,  eh ,  just thinking about emily getting married tomorrow .   
 what ?  where ?  
what am i looking at ?  
monica ,  i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t come by last night .  i was out with gary; he let me ride around with him in his cop car .  we saw and prevented crimes .  
uh - huh !  
it &apos;s thechandler !  !   
hey joe does it have meatballs on it ?  
does it have melted cheese and marinara sauce ?  
yeah ,  you can &apos;t eat that in my car .  
your tax dollars ?  
 wow !  that sandwich really does smell good .  
i can &apos;t smell your sandwich ?  
okay ,  i &apos;ll give them back .   look !  what is so great about that sandwich ?  
okay .  
yeah .  
sur - surprise him ?  we &apos;re not ,  we &apos;re not gonna make anybody mad are we ?  
yeah ,  no one talks like that !  
look at officer ross riding back here with the visitors .  
what ?  what ?  what ?  what is it ?  
hey ,  it &apos;s okay .  it was just a car backfire .   hey ,  look at that !  you tried to save your buddy .  you see that ?  you see what he did ?  
uh ,  hello !  !  
yeah ,  but - but he didn &apos;t know that !  
bye !   
oh ,  i just went for a walk ,  around the living room .  whatever 
no .  no i &apos;m just tired .  y &apos;know ,  from - from the walk .  
you dove in front of ross !  ross !  
i do not hate ross !  
what picture ?  
look i &apos;m very glad that you saved ross from the car backfire ,  but y &apos;know ,  it could &apos;ve been a bullet and you y &apos;know ,  you didn &apos;t try to save me !  
when it comes down to it ,  you would risk your life for ross before you would for me .  that &apos;s the bottom line .  
from a bullet !  
much sense ?  !  
so you risked your life ,  for a sandwich !  
so you didn &apos;t uh ,  choose ross before me .  
really ?  !  
thanks .   
no ,  eh ,  oh - oi ,  easy ,  it &apos;s not a hot dog !   
 oh - oi - ho ,  yeah !  
hm - hmm .   
i thought you were showing me how much you mean to me .  
yes ,  if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches .  
uh - huh ,  that &apos;s why they call it staten island .  
 also an island .   
 .  
are you serious ?  !  
wow !  we are pretty good at this !  hey !  we totally forgot about lunch !  
 hey ,  you guys 
what - what is it ?  !  
it &apos;s a ,  it &apos;s a cat !  
on a cat ?  ?  !  !  !  !  
free cats do that too ,  y &apos;know .  {which reminds me ,  if i might get a little political here ,  support your local animal shelter .  pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from ,  you get a much better deal from the shelter ,  plus they probably won &apos;t die on you in a week and a half .  if you want a leash ,  go to the pet shop .  if you want the dog for that leash ,  go to the shelter and save it &apos;s life .  now back to regularly scheduled programming . } 
 hey ,  you wanna get something to eat or uh ,  do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth ?  huh ?  
yeah ?  
uhh ,  yeah it would !  let &apos;s do it !  
okay !   
what ?  
i have to pee .  and rachel &apos;s in the bathroom !   
now when they found the remains of the mesozoic mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a paleozoic amphibian in its jaws !  how did it get there ?  !  {y &apos;know ,  sometimes i think the script writers throw in a line like that to try to trip me up .  but it won &apos;t work .  i &apos;ll always have the last laugh !  <manical_laugh . wav> okay ,  so maybe i &apos;m a little deluded ,  it &apos;s probably just my spellchecker .  but ,  i must admit i did get mesozoic and paleozoic on the first attempt .  yay me !  anyhoo } 
 hey guys !  
joey ,  i left my watch on the counter last night .   it was right here ,  where is it ?  
guys ,  could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it !  
monica ,  whatever you do ,  do not drop that ball !  
i don &apos;t want a cat !  
four hours ?  you guys have been doing this for four hours ?  
he &apos;s a dropper !  
oh !  oh !  that &apos;s so hard .    
come on guys !  suck it up !  we &apos;re closing in on ten hours !  it &apos;s gut - check time !  
oh ,  thank god !  
yeah .  yeah ,  i &apos;ll be alright .  
well ,  my eye is a little itchy .   
chandler !  
you okay there man ?  
uh ,  it &apos;s a piece of paper and it says ,   &quot; ross &quot;  on it .  
you got the lead in a movie ?  that &apos;s amazing !  what &apos;s the movie about ?  !  
ohh - oh ,  chilling !  
yeah ,  i know that means buddy !  
no !  no ,  her cab !  she probably won &apos;t be using it; you can drive it to las vegas .  
whoa - whoa - whoa ,  what are we going to do about my job ?  
oh hey joey !  what &apos;s up ?  
yeah ,  i &apos;ve been around .  
ooh ,  if you take the northern route there &apos;s a man in illinois with a beard of bees .  {okay ,  i must protest this ,  i &apos;ve lived in illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees !  wisconsin ,  on the other hand ,  might be a different story . } 
but on the southern route there &apos;s a chicken that plays tic - tac - toe .  
oh ,  i know a way that you can decide !  all right ,  i &apos;m going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can .  
good ,  but wait .  okay ,  all right ,  here we go .  now i want you to relax .  take a deep breath .  clear your mind .   which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites ?  
which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer ?  
who would you rather sleep with monica or rachel ?  
no thinking !  no thinking !  tie or ascot ?  
north route or south route ?  
bamn !  there you go !  huh ?  
oh ,  this guy again .   
uhh ,  not much .  you guys want to see a movie tonight ?  
i don &apos;t know ,  umm 
what &apos;s with her ?  
okay .  
action .  
dude ,  you are sick .  
 hey !  
i love you .  {there &apos;s another continuity error here .  before monica says i love you ,  chandler &apos;s holding the vests so that you couldn &apos;t see the collar ,  you could see all three ,  and they were folding nicely .  after she says the line and the camera cuts back to chandler ,  you can only see two out of the three ,  you can see the collar of the top one ,  and it looks like it was folded sloppily ,  unlike before .  hey ,  you notice things while spending this much time on this ! } 
hey ,  so where are we staying ?  is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite ?  
i see ,  but once you get your first paycheck you &apos;ll be springing a big hotel suite ,  right ?  i mean ,  lead in a movie ,  they must be paying you a lot ?  
so you don &apos;t get paid unless the movie makes money ?  
 hey !  
i just wanna say good - bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me ,  huh ?  twenty bucks on black 15 .  
bye you guys !  
okay !  
oh honey ,  i &apos;ll say good - bye to you at the car if you don &apos;t mind the puss .   
we &apos;ve been driving for a half - hour ,  and you haven &apos;t looked at the road once .

maybe i could give thanks by taking my playstation over to my new apartment .  
are you guys going to chandlers for thanksgiving ?

happy thanksgiving !  
and who else is going to be there ?

i - i - im leaving the show ?  
who told you that ?  
which one ?  was it bald or was it tall ?  
yknow what ?  it doesnt matter !  because it is not true !  
and if it were true ,  how dare you come to me ask me for tips about a character that ive been playing for 20 yearsill give you a tip !   
 im 16 .  
 youre absolutely right they are writing me out of the show .  they dont know exactly when its going to happen ,  but apparently it &apos;s going to be very soon and thats it .  
yeah ,  thanks .  
oh youre right .  thank you !  whats your name again ?  
 im having a conversation here !   you were saying ?  
all right joey ,  i will help you .  not because i - i owe it to this stupid show ,  but because i owe it to jessica .  
youre so welcome .  
is that supposed to be me ?  
yeah but jessica doesnt have an english accent .  
so ,  the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence .  so ,  when jessica enters a room for instance ,  she owns everything and every person in that room .   you try .  
no ,  he already knows that he owns everything in the room !  hes not finding it out for the first time !  so ,  try it again .  
right .  hes not angry at the room either .  try it again ,  he owns it !  he owns the room .  it is his .  he owns ,  owns ,  owns ,  owns the room !  he owns it !  !   all right ,  its a little weird ,  but its getting better .   oh well ,  im gonna miss this woman so much .  i dont know what im going to do !  i mean ,  its been 20 years of my life .  
i am .  i am ,  but i dont know ,  you know .  an actor of a certain age is not that easy .  
i probably shouldve just left years ago when the offers were pouring in ,  but yknow i just got so comfy here !  and ohh ,  i turned down some amazing work !  
well ,  lets just say if i left 15 years ago ,  the landscape of mexican cinema would be very different today !  
but well now ,  nows a different time for me .   
 you think im hot ?  
oh yeah - yeah ,  we should get the  so when jessica kisses a man ,  she usually puts umm ,  both her hands on the mans face .   
no !  its because that way the camera only sees her !   do you wanna try it ?  
well ,  you certainly own that room .  
hi .  
 monica !  !  !  !  monica !  !  !  !   
oh that explains all the womens underwear .

yeah .  o - okay .  
how about receiving ?

no ,  not us  us !   
see joe ,  we want you to tell stories but yknow ,  romantic stories .  nice stories .  
there you go !  
joe ?  
isnt that what happened with you and the bridesmaid ?  
no that is not what happened with us .  well ,  i was umm ,  i was really sad that night because this guy thought that i was rosss mom .  
and then chandler was ,  was really sweet and he consoled me .  and well we drank too much 
and i was a perfect gentleman and i walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight .  
but then later that night

chandler ,  please !  do you know how unbelievably glad i am that joey was not there that night ?  !  
 look there is no way youre doing this wedding now .  okay ?  
it is to me .  you wanted to sleep with batman ,  and instead you had to settle for robin .   
hey .  do you want this scone ?   it came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you !  
look joe ,  i know you wanted to do the wedding 
how can i not be upset ?  okay ?  i finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first !  
thats what you should say .  
when youre marrying us; thats what you should say .  
id love it if you would do it .  
but those are the words !  those exact words !  
hey - hey .

staying out of the way .  
there were only twelve .

 monica 
 yeah ?  
yes .   
oh ,  we were helping chandler write his vows ,  but he kicked us out because joey kept making inappropriate suggestions .  
i cant believe theyve been together for three years .  
believe me ,  it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long .    
i &apos;ve had a very long ,  hard day .  
ahh ,  no thanks .  no chicken ,  bye - bye then .  
i dont know why they didnt just tell us .  
i know !  i mean its not like we werent cool about it .   
yes ,  but you cannot tell anyone !  no one knows !  
it happened in london .  
the reason we didn &apos;t tell anyone was because we didn &apos;t want to make a big deal out of it .  
please ?  please ?  !  we just don &apos;t want to deal with telling everyone ,  okay ?  just promise you won &apos;t tell .   
okay ,  so now they know that you know ,  and they don &apos;t know that rachel knows ?  
phoebe knows about us !  
them ?  !  who &apos;s them ?  
joey !  
i can not believe he would do that to monwhoa !   joey ,  do they know that we know ?  
joey !  
god ,  they thought they can mess with us !  they &apos;re trying to mess with us ?  !  they don &apos;t know that we know they know we know !   joey ,  you can &apos;t say anything !  
he &apos;s not backing down .  he went to get lotion .  
joey look ,  just look at it this way ,  the sooner phoebe breaks chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open .  
okay !  
joey !   wow ,  you didnt rip off any buttons .  
i justi thought you guys were doing it ,  i didn &apos;t know you were in love !

but joey the baby is going to be crying ,  its going to be loud .

all right fine !  but im only doing this for you !  
i understand party ?  
what are you doing ?

i cant believe there is a naked hooker in there !  
uh ,  no .  but i could pretend to strip ,  but thats gonna cost extra .  okay ,  heres the extras ,  handcuffs ,  spanking  
that is funny ,  maybe for my birthday shell murder someone .  
hey !  i did not dump rachel !   nor are we still together .   can i just  why dont we just let the machine get that ?  
why would she do that ?  
whats taking you boys so long ?

i dont think weve actually done this before !  
well we we still hang out .  
well yknow ,  things are different .  im im married now .  
yeah ,  i miss that too .  i tell you what; from now on well make time to hang out with each other .  
 theres gonna be a wedding !   thats unacceptable rachel !  what the hell does love have to do with it anyway ?  !  there are more important things in a marriage other than love !   constantly thinking about things !  you have to think about the consequences of your decision .   
 oh my god !  let me see that !   
oh ,  and by the way ,  hes lost a bunch of weight .  i mean he looks goo - ood !  okay ,  i mean really ,  really gorgeous !   i still love chandler .  
all right okay ,  just so you know ,  im not gonna make a turkey this year .  
well phoebe doesnt eat turkey 
turkeys are beautiful ,  intelligent animals !  
all right !  okay ,  its just phoebe .  wills still on a diet ,  chandler doesnt eat thanksgiving food ,  and rachels having her aversion to poultry .  
remember i had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken ?  
anyway ,  it just doesnt seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people .  okay ?  its a lot of work .  
all right fine !  if it means that much to you !  but justtheres gonna be a ton left over .  
all right ,  youre telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting ?  
hey ,  what are you doing ?  you gotta save room ,  youve got almost an entire turkey to eat .  
all right .  
i actually know what youre talking about .  im here to tell you something my friend ,  you can eat and eat and eat but nothing will ever fill that void .  
will !  from high school .  
 uh rachel ?  rachel ,  why dont you sit here ?   and will you sit way over there .    
 this is chandlers chicken .  this is the turkey .   
about nineteen pounds .  
i said it was typical .  typical of you ,  rachel green ,  queen rachel does whatever she wants in little rachel land .   
joey stop staring !  theres nothing there !  its not true !  
oh !   the turkey ,  until he turns the plate around and reveals he only ate one side . ] 
joey ,  you dont have to finish that .

yes .  .  .  what is the end of that sentence ?  
wow !  
is that why he &apos;s acting so weird .  .  .  ?  he &apos;s jealous .  .  .  ?  oh my god ,  that is crazy .  it &apos;s not like i &apos;m attracted to geoffrey .  .  .  
science .  .  .  ?  academia .  .  .  ?  being a good father .  .  .  ?  
i can &apos;t believe he &apos;s that upset about this .  .  .  
hey !

who &apos;s up for puppets ?  
actually studies have shown that the movement and colours help their cerebral development .  .  .  the whimsical characters are just for us .

do you have any ideas ?  
joe .  .  .  emus are birds .  you raise them for meat .  
joey ,  i think you should consider something a little less risky .  i mean ,  i think in this market ,  real estate is your best investment . the fed .  just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible .   that &apos;s right ,  i know some stuff !  
oh hi ,  come on in .  i &apos;m catherine ,  the listing agent .  
mmm that &apos;s enough about you !  
oh .  .  .  okay ,  sorry !  
we &apos;re not gonna have this conversation again .  .  .  look at this place .  why am i so intimidated by this guy ?  pretentious art ,  this huge macho couch .  when we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing monica to a real man !   you don &apos;t think he &apos;s here ,  do you ?   
 look at these videos .  you know ,  i mean ,  who does he think he is ?  magnum force ,  dirty harry ,  cool hand luke .  .  .  oh my god !

i &apos;m not gonna watch it .  .  .  i don &apos;t need to watch it .  .  .  i mean ,  what good could possibly come from watching ?   well ,  we know i &apos;m gonna watch it .   
don &apos;t judge me ,  i &apos;m only human !  
i had to !  okay ,  imagine you were married .  .  .  and you found a tape of your wife in another guys &apos; apartment .  .  .  wouldn &apos;t you need to know what was on it ?  
some girl .  .  .  !  ?  
yeah .  .  .  !  ?  
allright ,  i &apos;m gonna watch it .  .  .  i mean look ,  it &apos;s probably not even what i think it is .  .  .  and even if it is .  .  .  it can &apos;t possibly be as bad as what i &apos;m picturing in my head .  .  .   can it ?  
then you &apos;re gonna have to watch it for me .  
just for a few seconds ,  so i can know what it is .  .  .  please ?  
why am i hearing cheering ?  
football ?  just football ?  
it &apos;s football .  .  .  it &apos;s just football .  .  .  this is great !  this is the first time i &apos;ve ever enjoyed football .  .  .  it may be customary to get a beer .  .  .   what the .  .  .   what are you doing ?

muskogee ?  that &apos;s like four hours from tulsa !  woo hoo !  soap ,  days of our lives .

and joey ?  
you mean ,  when you were a baby .  
 hey ,  listen ,  joey ,  about molly ,  i really prefer if you didn &apos;t go after her .  
because it took us months to find a good nanny and i wouldn &apos;t want anything to ,  you know ,  drive her away .

no  .  .  .  the leather sticks to my ass .  you know ,  this isn &apos;t fair .  what makes you think that i &apos;m just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off ?  huh ?  can &apos;t you guys open your minds to the possibility that i actally like her ,  and might want something real ?   look ,  the truth is ,  i haven &apos;t felt this way about anyone since rachel ,  ok ?  i didn &apos;t think i could ever love again .   
ok  .  .  .   well ,  uh ,  joey ,  i guess we have no problem .  
well it depends .  
no i totally disagree .  no i think it &apos;s fine for a guy to do something like that .  such you an actor .  not that you need to ,  your eyebrows are .  .  .  
your knuckles are kinda hairy too .  .  .

well ,  i &apos;ll probably be back to pick her up around six ,  but she &apos;s in the bedroom all ready to go .  but she did actually fall back to sleep ,  so .  .  .  
bye !  hey ,  i hope emma isn &apos;t making it too hard on you .  
yeah ?  
yeah ,  that &apos;ll do it .  
i &apos;m ,  i &apos;m okay .  
sure ,  i mean ,  do i wish me and rachel living together would have worked out ?  of course .  you know ,  i &apos;m disappointed ,  but it &apos;s not like it &apos;s a divorce .  
no ,  it &apos;s not a divorce ,  it is not a divorce !  anyway ,  i think rachel and i need to ,  you know ,  get on with our lives ,  maybe ,  maybe start seeing other people .  
yeah ,  sure ,  why not ?  in fact ,  if you know anyone that would be good for me .  .  .

goodie !  thanks .  so ,  how is it living with rachel again ?  i mean ,  apart from the great food .  
oh my god ,  rachel asked me if i knew anyone for her too .  
i don &apos;t know .  they &apos;re so perfect for each other; it &apos;s crazy .  
i just wish they &apos;d realise they should be together .  
i know .  they should be a family .  they should get married and have more children .  
you know what ?  maybe once they start dating ,  and they see what &apos;s out there ,  they &apos;ll realise how good they are for each other .  
so ,  what are we gonna do ?  are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people ?  
yeah .   oh ,  i know what we can do .  we could set ross and rachel up on horrible dates ,  so that they &apos;ll realise how good they are together .  
yeah ,  you know what the best part of it is ?  i get to do my  &quot; plan - laugh .  &quot;    
ooh ,  joey .  
hey .  i &apos;m so excited; i just set up rachel with the worst guy tonight .

oh ,  i uh ,  i mean ,  i .  .  .  dude ,  i spent the whole conference with charlie .  
ross is coming over .  i think now would be a really good time to talk to him .

yes ,  and i have to say ,  i am not just hurt .  i am insulted .  when i tell somebody i did something .  .  .  
why are you so sure i didn &apos;t watch this tape ?  
well ,  this is going well .   
 here &apos;s how i know you didn &apos;t watch the tape ,  ok ?   if you had seen what was on this tape ,  believe me ,  you would have some comments .  alright ,  now remember ,  i got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in japan .   joey says  &quot; ichiban &quot;  .  it displays a few girls dancing around and joey fills most of the screen ,  he puts something blue on his lips and smacks them saying  &quot; lipstick for men !  &quot;  it goes on to show him playing a guitar and putting on more blue lipstick .  in the end he says seductively  &quot; ichiban .  .  .  lipstick for men &quot;  and  &quot; sahiko &quot;  and it ends .  chandler and rachel are speechless . ) 
o - oh my god !  
joey ,  what .  .  .  is .  .  .  this .  .  . thing .  .  .  doing here ?  
joey ,  we &apos;re not keeping this !  
alright ,  fine .  you can keep it .  as long as you don &apos;t mind that she &apos;s haunted .  
she climbs out of the frame ,  and then drags her half - a - body across the floor ,  just looking for legs to steal .   and then with her one good hand ,  she slo - o - owly re - e - a - aches up and turns your doorknob .  
look ,  i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t give them your tape .  and i promise ,  next time to submit you whether i think you are right for the part or not .  
excellent !

ah ,  so glad you decided to come .  
what ?  
no it &apos;s not .  we had an inspection and they didn &apos;t find anything .

when your head was hanging out the window ,  it didn &apos;t hit a mailbox ,  did it ?

joey ,  this is al t .  booker ,   the guy who eats paper .  i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve heard that estelle passed away .   i wanted to let you know there &apos;s a memorial for her at the westside chapel ,  tomorrow at ten .  hope you can make it .  
 joey ,  it &apos;s estelle .   
yeah ,  i wanted to call and tell you that there &apos;s no hard feelings for firing me .
