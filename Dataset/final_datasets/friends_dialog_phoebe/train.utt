phoebe ,  you &apos;re on .  
 okay ,  hi .  ladies and gentlemen ,  back by popular demand ,  miss phoebe buffay .  wooh !  
 thanks ,  hi .  um ,  i wanna start with a song that means a lot i made a man with eyes of coal and a smile so bewitchin &apos; ,  how was i supposed to know that my mom was dead in the kitchen ?   la lalala la la la la lalala la la .  .  .   
  .  .  . my mother &apos;s ashes even her eyelashes are resting in a little yellow jar ,  and sometimes when it &apos;s breezy .  .  .   
no .  no ,  that &apos;s -  that &apos;s okay .  
noth -  i was -  i was just saying to my -  
 - hard quality .  and uh ,  while daryl hannah is beautiful in a conventional way ,  you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace .  then ,  uh ,  that - that - that &apos;s when you started yelling .   
just a smidge .  
i think it &apos;s romantic .  
yeah !  
wait a minute ,  wait a minute ,  i see where this is going ,  you &apos;re gonna ask him to new year &apos;s ,  aren &apos;t you .  you &apos;re gonna break the pact .  she &apos;s gonna break the pact .  
 .  .  . but ,  you can &apos;t actually test this theory ,  because today &apos;s particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions .  
yuh .  
uh ,  that &apos;s definitely a ,  uh ,  valid question .  and ,  uh ,  the answer would be  yes .  yes i was .  but ,  see ,  i wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment ,  because ,  well ,   &apos;cause it &apos;s you .  
right .  but ,  see ,  the longer i waited ,  the more phenomenal the kiss had to be ,  and now we &apos;ve reached a place where it &apos;s just gotta be one of those things where i just like .  .  .  sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it .  and ,  uh ,  i &apos;m not really a ,  uh ,  sweeping sorta fella .  
rrrreally .  
 .  .  . now ?  now ?  
okay ,  okay ,  okay .   y &apos;know what ,  this was just really expensive .   and i &apos;ll take -  this was a gift .

look ,  i .   .   .  
alright ,  that is not your father ,  that &apos;s just a picture of a guy in a frame .  
it was your mother &apos;s idea .  ya know ,  she didn &apos;t want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left ,  and ,  i didn &apos;t want to go along with it ,  but ,  well then she died and ,  and it was harder to argue with her .  not impossible ,  but harder .  
last i heard ,  he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate .  
honey .  
anyway ,  that &apos;s all i know .  that ,  and this .   this is the real him .  
hey .  
c &apos;mon now phoe ,  don &apos;t still be mad at me .  how &apos;s it going ?  
well ,  i think you &apos;re better off without him .  oh honey ,  i know he &apos;s your daddy but ,  but to me he &apos;s still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her gremlin .  
i know .  ok ,  i wasn &apos;t completely honest with you when i told you that ,  uh ,  i didn &apos;t know exactly where he lived .  
he lives at 74 laurel drive in middletown .  if you hit the dairy queen ,  you &apos;ve gone too far .  you can take my cab .  
now ,  remember ,  nobody else drives that cab .  
hey .   
hey .

how far &apos;d ya get ?  
alright ,  we &apos;re gettin &apos; closer .  
phoebs ,  what &apos;s goin &apos; on ?

well ,  so why not go knock ?  
phoebs ,  that &apos;s ok .  you took a big step today .  
yeah ,  and when you do ,  he &apos;ll be lucky to have you .

pheebs ,  who &apos;s evelyn dermer ?

you know ,  it &apos;s funny when my parents got divorced ,  they sent me to this shrink ,  and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves .  but in your case it &apos;s actually kinda true .  
damn .  my mail order grandfather hasn &apos;t come yet .  
yes ,  hi ,  mr .  adelman .  thanks for meeting me .  
um ,  do you wanna sit ?  i do for you ,  my dear ?  
i don &apos;t know how to say this ,  but i think when your wife &apos;s spirit left her body ,  it um ,  kind of stuck around in me .  
yeah .  ok ,  you don &apos;t have to believe me but um ,  can you think of any unfinished business she might have had ,  like any reason she &apos;d be hanging around ?  she always used to say that before she died ,  she wanted to see everything .  
everything ?  
whoa ,  that &apos;s a lot of stuff .  
if you want .

these are my night vision goggles .  this is the book i pretend to read when i &apos;m watching her in the park .  and these are mad lips ,  they &apos;re just for fun .  
oh ,  this is log i kept ,  recording her every movement .  do you wanna here something from it ?  
it &apos;s about you .  
 i met phoebe today .  she was really nice to me eventhough i &apos;m such a loser .  and ,  then when i was walking home i thought about her a lot ,  it was weird ,  but kinda cool .  
i was thinking what it would be like to kiss you .  
no .  
see that &apos;s just something i said now ,  so that maybe i could kiss you .  
maybe ,  i should call this place and get them to put my  &apos;days of our lives &apos; on here .  you know ,  juice this puppy up a little .  
how &apos;s the maniac ?  
phoebe ,  what are you doing ?  
pheebs ,  this guy has been obsessed with your sister ,  for god knows how long ,  okay ,  you don &apos;t just give up something like that .  
you &apos;re taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles ?  
pheebs ,  wake up and smell the restraining order .  
i think ,  that if you really like this guy ,  you should just trust him .  
phoebe ?  
what are you doing ?  
were you following me ?  
so you spied on me .  i can &apos;t believe you don &apos;t trust me .   
i &apos;m sorry .  i &apos;m sorry .  i tried to stop ,  but i couldn &apos;t .  i &apos;m so pathetic .  
uh - huh ,  i don &apos;t know .  
welcome everybody ,  welcome to amazing discoveries !  
 hey !  
well ,  i &apos;ll tell ya i do enjoy guilt ,  but ,  ah ,  it wasn &apos;t me .  
how is it you ?  
see ,  now this is why i keep notepads everywhere .  
well ,  estelle tried ,  you know .  the casting director told her that i missed my chance .  
pheebs ,  you can &apos;t do that .  the casting director doesn &apos;t talk to friends ,  she only talks to agents .  
what ,  what are you doing ?  what are you doing ?  
hang up ,  hang up .   
is anybody else scared ?  
come on baby ,  come on !  
very nice touch .

they actually said that ?  
no ,  no ,  no ,  see that &apos;s why you have to do this job ,  agents always lie .  you know ,  estelle just says stuff like  &apos;they went another way &apos; ,  but this ,  i can use this .   i canna work on a new accent .

oh my god !  !  great !  
y &apos;know ,  i mean ,  really we do realise that theres an age difference between us .  
pheebs ,  what ,  is it the age thing ?  
pheebs ,  he seems to enjoy it .  
well ,  have - have you told him how you feel ?  
pheebs ,  if you dont tell him ,  soon hes gonna be married ,  and then youre gonna hate yourself .

oh my god ,  who died on this ?  !

oh no - no ,  never say that .  if we cant get it out then we can cut around the stain ,  add a little lace ,  you make a stylish throw .  
 hi .   wait ,  no !  just put the mail down .  its - its me !  
oh well ,  um ,  your ,  your laundry just smelled so good ,  that i thought id curl up in it .  is that all right ?  
oh ,  well just probably the worst one since ive been alive .  
umm ,  alice ah ,  she ah ,  called it off .  
uh ,  no ,  not really ,  just that i was too young ,  y &apos;know ,  but i dont see how i could all of the sudden be too young ,  cause im older than i was when we first got together .  
yeah ,  if the best is like unbelievable pain !  
y &apos;know ,  i just was finally happy y &apos;know .  for the first time in my life !  after my dad left me ,  and then ,  and then getting arrested for stealing those birds ,  and then ,  and then the whole punctured lung thing !  i can ,  its still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather ,  but with alice all that stuff kinda went away .  and now its ,  and now its gone and i dont know why !  
what ?  
wait a minute ,  wait ,  this is because of you ?  
well ,  you ,  wait no ,  my mother didnt want us to be together ,  but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch .  
phoebes right frank .  i know its hard to hear ,  but it wouldve been wrong to go through with it .  i - i - i was being selfish ,  even though we ,  we want the same things now ,  in the future we may not .   is that it ,  is that what it is ?  
right ,  not just that .  umm ,  even though we love each other as much as we do ,  none the less 
none the less .  umm ,  youre too young to ,  to really know what you want .   
i gave you a key for emergencies !  
i know .  
well ,  i told him i would think about it ,  but im gonna tell him no .  
i mean i think id say no to anybody right now .   oh ,  but it was so strange .  i mean im standing there with this charming ,  cute guy ,  whos asking me to go out with him ,  which im allowed to do ,  and i felt guilty .  y &apos;know ,  like id be cheating on ross or something .  
i dont have any issues with my father .  
and youre our age .  youre our age .  
what like pete dakota ?  
absolutely !   now get out of here you !  !   okay ,  im running out of places i can touch him !  look ,  is there something wrong with me ?  i mean why am i only attracted to guys where theres no future ?  either theyre too old ,  or theyre too young ,  and then theres pete whos - whos crazy about me ,  and whos absolutely perfect for me ,  and theres like zip going on !  i mean ,  seriously ,  does it sound like somethings wrong with me ?  !  
cause its - its not his last name .  
no ,  its not like ,  like phil spiderman .  hes a spider ,  man .  y &apos;know like ah ,  like goldman is a last name ,  but theres no gold man .  
so ,  ahh ,  what kind of powers would gold man have ?

i know ,  but now we have this second one and it just ,  it feels like its snowballing ,  yknow ?  
i got offered the head chef job at allesandros .  
its okay ,  cause y &apos;know what ?  you dont really need me for the business .

yknow ,  youre right .  thank you .  
prague ?  
oh i know !  !

we were having lunch .  yeah and then all of the sudden we were like ,   &quot; hey !  y &apos;know ,  were here ,  having lunch lets get married !  
yeah ,  and they - and they say that our - that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm ,  her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl .  so we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into .

pheebs ,  youre talking about putting your body through an awful lot ,  i mean morning sickness ,  uhh ,  labour ,  and its all for somebody else !

hi !  
im sorry ,  im late .  
wow !  you really go all out when youre expecting company .

oh no !  no - no !  i understand the pain !  dont - dont hurt the puppy .  
oh ,  i get a puppy !  !  
why ?  and everything now ,  but umm ,   uhh phoebe ,  would you please look at me and not the puppy ,  its very important .  
okay .  i only wish i had someone there that had given up babies ,  that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies .  i just think that ,  it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life .  so ,  how ever hard it is to give up this puppy ,  it would be like a million times harder to give up a child .   i really shouldnt have given you the puppy first .  
why is phoebe singing to carl mulden ?

 what &apos;s with him ?  
 okay !  
it &apos;s not that weird ,  is it ?  
to be fair ,  he doesnt seem to be impersonating fonzie 
okay ,  phoebe ,  this dr .  oberman .  he has no strong feelings about fonzie or any of the happy days gang .  
hi !  and you &apos;re going into what grade ?  see ,  i - i graduated early 
 uh - huh ,  me too .  ross ,  maybe i should &apos;ve specified that i &apos;d be needing a grown up doctor .  
all right ,  you &apos;re getting there .  oh ,  and y &apos;know ,  these babies are very ,  very lucky .  
they have the honor of being born on the fonz &apos;s half - birthday .  
honey ,  y &apos;know i just gotta tell you ,  i think this is such a terrific thing you &apos;re having these babies for frank and alice .  
yeah !  
yeah !  
okay ,  phoebe ,  honey ,  you gotta be kidding .  i mean ,  you know you cannot keep one of these babies !  
yes !  yes !  yes ,  i do !  i do know !  frank and alice are gonna want to keep all of their children !  
phoebe ,  no !  this is ,  this is insane .  
me ?  !  
no !  forget it !  i am not gonna ask frank to give you one of his kids !  !  
you &apos;re right .   
no ,  i haven &apos;t had a chance to be alone with him yet .  
y &apos;know who i always liked ?  mork .   
 hey !  
 how are you doing ?  
hey ,  y &apos;know ,  alice is gonna be here so soon ,  you couldn &apos;t just like do me a favor and like ,  like hold them in ?

i think you &apos;re my favorite .  
 hi .   hey ,  hi !  so uh ,  frank and alice wanted me to tell you that they &apos;re still outside making phone calls .  
yeah ,  umm ,  no honey .  
yeah ,  sure yeah .  yeah .   
phoebe ,  we are so proud of you !  you &apos;re amazing !  
so does it really hurt as bad as they say ?  
so uh ,  now that little chandler turned out to be a girl ,  what are they gonna name her ?  
a little uh ,  good deed for pbs and a little tv exposure ,  now that &apos;s the kind of math joey likes to do !  
what &apos;s wrong with pbs ?  
why dont you like pbs ,  pheebs ?  
well y &apos;know a lot of those muppets don &apos;t have thumbs .  
i &apos;m sorry pheebs ,  i just ,  y &apos;know ,  i just wanted to do a good deed .  like - like you did with the babies .  
whoa !  whoa !  whoa !  what about you ,  having those babies for your brother ?  talk about selfish !  
well ,  yeah ,  it was a really nice thing and all ,  but it made you feel really good right ?  
it made you feel good ,  so that makes it selfish .  look ,  there &apos;s no unselfish good deeds ,  sorry .  
well ,  may i ask for one example ?  
that &apos;s because all people are selfish .  
are you calling you people ?   yeah ,  well sorry to burst that bubble ,  pheebs ,  but selfless good deeds don &apos;t exist .  okay ?  and you the deal on santa clause right ?  
 yay !   
that he doesn &apos;t exist .  
maybe joey &apos;s right .  maybe all good deeds are selfish .  
yes !

ooh ,  candy bars ,  crossword puzzles 
it &apos;s le poo .  
hi !  
that &apos;s not ross !

phoebe ?   i &apos;m sorry about the whole lifting out thing .   you gotta come with me !  
wherever i go .  come on you and me ,  we &apos;ll - we &apos;ll start a new group ,  we &apos;re the best ones .

we all hate emily !  
unreasonable ?  how about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married !  you have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work !  all right ,  it &apos;s about compromise !  do you always like it ?  no !  do you do it ?  yes !  because it &apos;s not all laughing ,  happy ,  candy in the sky ,  drinking coffee at central perk all the time !  it &apos;s real life ,  okay ?  it &apos;s what grown - ups do !

little baby girl chandler ,  where i have heard that before ?  oh right ,  coach ruben .   do you know what pheebs ?  when youre done over there ,  we kinda have a situation over here too .   
i just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone .  phoebe ,  you can be in charge of wiping .  and yknow mon ,  you can be in charge of diapering and i can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around  
this is so great !  this is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant .

oh my god .  
phoebe ,  what ,  what happened here ?  !  
no ,  i hope not !  i tried to offer him some money ,  but he wouldnt take it .  
i figure that $1 , 500 would cover him for a few months ,  yknow ?  but i have to trick him into taking it so i wont hurt his pride .

 why dont we do a trial run .  
im the supply manager .  
we dont need any toner .  
okay ,  what was wrong with that call ?  
theyre always going to tell you they dont need toner ,  but thats okay because whatever they say ,  you can find the answer to it here in this script .  
so ,  i think youre ready to sell toner ,  do you have any last questions ?  
i dont need any toner .  
not me .  
you wanna know why .  you wanna know why ?  
okay ,  i dont need any toner because im going to kill myself .

well ,  was there anything else ?  !  
philadelphia .

there you go !

oh ,  and plus im 1 / 16th portuguese .  
oh ,  if i only want two kids ,  can i keep him for another year ?

well mainly because he &apos;s kissing that other guy .  
oh yeah he &apos;s too cute to be straight .  
all right ,  straight ,  and not subtle .   
oh ,  well ,  we can hand it to gunther and he &apos;ll put it in lost and found .  
what if ,  um ,  if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and i answer and we start talking and we fall in love .  i mean wouldn &apos;t that be a great story ?  kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age .  
what ?  wait !  why why do you get the story ?  
phoebe ,  you had a date three days ago .  
okay .  okay ,  see ?  i get the phone .  
yeah !   and until now ,  i didnt think id love again .

well umm ,  maybe we could uhh  ah - ha !  too slow !  !   
no phoebe !  you cannot get the phone that way; thats not fair !  okay look ,  i have an idea .  why dont we ,  why dont we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial ,  and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him .  and then whoever does gets the phone .  
i dont think so .  
 all right ,  first name on the speed dial is mom .  
okay no way ,  you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin .

 &apos;days of our lives &apos; !  that &apos;s why you look so familiar !  
what ?  !  
 of course we do !  mike is playing a game that we used to play in high school .  yeah ,  where we pretend we don &apos;t know each other .  we played all kinds of games .   hey ,  remember the one where i punch you in the face for not being cool ?  !

i &apos;m sorry ,  really ,  i &apos;m so embarrassed .  really ,  i &apos;m a pretty nice guy .  just ask my parole officer .  .  . apparently i &apos;m not a funny guy .  
because i was told i &apos;d get a free dinner ,  which i didn &apos;t .  and that i &apos;d meet a pretty girl .  which i did .  
my name in mike ,  and i do play piano .  
there isn &apos;t a piano here .  
that wouldn &apos;t stand in the way of a true pianist .  
really ?  
that &apos;s great .  what kind of music do you play ?  
do you think that maybe ,  sometime ,  i could .  .  .  
 
okay ,  wow ,  wow ,  wow .  watch the tongue people ,  we &apos;ve got a baby over here .  
well ,  bye mon ,  bye ross ,  rachel ,  bye emma !

people  so why you all dressed up .  
oh yea now um how is that going ,  is it getting serious ?  
you know i really admire your whole dating attitude ,  it &apos;s so healthy i &apos;m always like is this moving to fast ?  is this moving to slow ?  where &apos;s this going ?  
but you ,  your so much better off you just go from guy to guy having fun and never worrying that it terns into anything serious .  
there isn &apos;t that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying .   
i know and yet here you are all ready for the next date .  
no ,  no ,  no there &apos;s nothing wrong with you i mean you don &apos;t strike me as the type of person that wants to get married anyway .  
please don &apos;t cry because of me pheebs i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m talking about ,  i &apos;ve been divorced three times .  
phoebe  what &apos;s wrong ?  
hey ,  so are you sure your ready to go .  
do you have a compact in your purse ?  
so how &apos;d the date go ?  
so he hasn &apos;t called ?  
now i feel terrible this is all my fault .  
hey !  
yay !   quick thing ,  i went to talk to mike .  
oh boy you got mad at that part .  i went over there to tell him how great you are but you know me blah ,  blah ,  blah ,  and i ended up telling him that .  
umm .  that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named vicrum .  
well he seemed to bum hard that you &apos;d never been in a serious relationship .  
well phoebe ,  i think you &apos;ll feel better when you know a little bit about vicrum ,  his a kite designer  and he used to date oprah .   
good yeah just be honest with him .  
i &apos;ll get it 
 you know i &apos;m trying to think of the last time i opened a door and you weren &apos;t there ,  phoebe are you ok ?   
but rachel i thought she just had a baby with ross 
that is so wrong and on top of that his a glue sniffer .  
i just think there &apos;s somebody better out there for you ,   i mean i &apos;m not saying me but .  maybe me .  
and you don &apos;t have to worry about glue sniffing with me .  although i do smell the occasional magic marker ,  yeah ah anyway i just think i can make you happy .  
what &apos;s wrong ?  
uh huh 
no .  well look can i think your weird and also cool for telling me the truth and also wanna kiss you .  
 see ordinarily i would talk to her ,  but my confidence is shaken did i sleep with her ?  did i not sleep with her ?  
thursday ?  but that &apos;s halloween .  
so ,  so ,  is mike coming to dinner ?  
pheebs ,  i would make a reservation for five ,  because one ofus has dinner ?

 hey !  
hmhmm .

actually ,  in oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areasand offices with fewer than fifteen people .

ok ,  fine ,  these rats are our responsibility .  what happens when they mate and there are hundreds of them ?  
yeah  -  not such a problem with rats .  no ,  they &apos;re more of a  &quot; love the one you &apos;re with &quot;  kind of animals .  
well ,  i know this is gonna sound crazy ,  but ,  we could not let the box of rats ruin our lives .

 oh my god ,  it was you !  i can &apos;t believe it ,  you you mugged me ?  
it &apos;s not the best !  
 there &apos;s nothing you can say .  that was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me .

 oh my god ,  crap from the street ?   
oh my god .   i never thought i &apos;d see this again .   it &apos;s all here .  what made you save it all these years ?

still this is amazing oh my god ,  thank you ,  phoebe .  
i &apos;m gonna go .   
i haven &apos;t been home in a couple of days and i need to get some more clothes .

me too .   you know what ?  i just realised something .  i don &apos;t wanna go home .  
no ,  no !  what i mean is ,  i hate going back to my apartment now .  .  .  and partly because i live above a known crack den but .  .  .  mostly because when i &apos;m there ,  it &apos;s just ,  i really miss you .  so .  .  do you want to move in together ?  
so we &apos;re doing it ?  
yeah !  
phoebe and i are moving in together .  
i &apos;m gonna go to the bathroom .  
is that a bit you guys do ?  
i hear wedding bells .  
phoebe ,  i had no idea you were so conventional .  
you ready to go ?  
what are you talking about ?  
oh please ,  these guys ,  we haven &apos;t even moved in yet and they have us picking out china patterns .   
well hey ,  i wanna ask you about monica &apos;s little  &quot; groomy &quot;  joke .  
i get the joke .  sophisticated as it was .  now the thing i wanna say is .  .  .  maybe we should have talked about this before .  us living together ,  you &apos;re not expecting a proposal ,  right ?  
yeah well ,  that &apos;s the thing .  for me it &apos;s as far as it can ever go .  
look .  phoebe ,  i - i love you .  very much .  but i never want to get married again .  
it &apos;s just my first marriage was ,  you know such a disaster .  i kind of lost faith in the whole idea .  
at one point near the end she deliberately defecated .  .  .  .  .  
look it &apos;s not about who i would marry .  and i was certain the first time i got married it would last forever .  and i was totally wrong !  
look phoebe ,  it &apos;s not about you .  i just never wanna get married again .  
i &apos;m sorry .  are you ok with that ?  cause if not .  .  . maybe us moving in together isn &apos;t the best idea .  
trust me ,  i will never .  .  .  
hey !  
oh great now you &apos;re seeking me out to make jokes ?  i mean i can see for all hanging out but to come to my home !  
why ?  
never ?  
wow ,  are you still going to move in with him ?  
yeah ,  marriage .  .  .  stinks !  i mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving ?  get them married .  
no ,  i &apos;m sorry .  look i don &apos;t think that &apos;s what you wanna hear right now but i can &apos;t help it .  i love marriage .  
if you have to call me name ,  i prefer  &quot; ross the divorcer &quot;  .  it &apos;s just cooler .  look ,  i know my marriage isn &apos;t exactly work out .  but i love to be that committed to another person .  and carol had some good times before she became a lesbian .  .  .  and once afterward .  i &apos;m sorry .  
but come on !  i mean living together will be great !  i mean you guys have so much fun and you love mike .  
yeah see ?  and you are so excited about moving in together before ,  and you know what ?  you should be .  it &apos;s a big deal !  
the divorcer ,  to the rescue !  
hey !  what do you guys think about this .   &quot; ross 
hey pheebs ,  you know i &apos;m i &apos;m really glad you came to talk to me the other day and i hope i was a little helpful .  
good ,  good .  yeah coz the more i thought about it ,  the more i realised i don &apos;t think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you .  
well ,  i know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing ?  but is that really you ?  i mean can you honestly picture yourself in a volvo ?  
i don &apos;t know you &apos;d be so bored with marriage .  i mean it &apos;s so .  .  .  normal .  
yeah ,  seriously coz this is really heavy .   i mean not for me because i &apos;m only pretending to hold this ,  but for these guys .  
no but .  .  .  you don &apos;t want to get married either right ?  
you wanna get married ?  
aaaaand .  .  .  .  .  .  .  hernia .  
but if you wanna get married why didn &apos;t you say something before ?  
i want to live with you too !  let &apos;s do that !  
can we at least try living together ?  i mean you might change your mind about marriage .  
no .  
but i don &apos;t want this to end .  
i can &apos;t believe this is gonna end .  i guess i &apos;ll have my stuff packed up .  
hey phoebe .  .  .  how you doin &apos; ?  you feelin &apos; better ?  
oh ,  i &apos;m so sorry !  
you &apos;re not gonna need my help ?  
oh good ,   &apos;cause i &apos;ve already thought of 3 .  .  .  4 !  i &apos;ve just thought of a fourth

i ordered chinese food .   
phoebe !  
damnit phoebe !  how did you even call him ?  
look ,  guys ,  you can &apos;t do this ,  it &apos;s just going to make getting over each other ,  that much harder .  
sure !  if you &apos;re just gonna hang out as friends ,  then maybe i &apos;ll join ya .  you know ,  i &apos;m your friend  and mike &apos;s friend  .  
 you look really beautiful .  
oh no no no no .  .  .  this is dangerous territory .  keep it clean !

i &apos;m not really comfortable with these questions !  
you don &apos;t have to do that ,  i &apos;ll pay for myself .  but just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys  -  that &apos;s so sweet !  come here  
although if we &apos;re gonna do that ,  we should probably call me  &quot; daddy &quot;  too .  
i  .  .  .  i was just talking about rachel .  
i &apos;m sorry ,  idea time is over .  
ok ,  fine !  !  i bought 20 extra tickets for me and chandler .

phoebe ,  we lost half of them .  
weird .  .  your psychic didn &apos;t mention anything about the scary pigeon .  .  .  
  &quot; hello .  th - this is the pigeon from the balcony calling to apologise &quot;    &quot; i sh .  .  i shouldn &apos;t have knocked the tickets out of the pretty lady &apos;s hand .  it - it was all my fault .  not hers .  bye .  coo .  &quot;   
no ,  she was just much better at job than me !  
no .  
me too .  so much for my dinosaur / amelia earhart theme park .  
you guys ,  what was the powerball number again ?  
what ?  
let me see !   
phoebe ,  you don &apos;t have any of the first five numbers .  
wow ,  you &apos;d think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout .  
so pheebs ,  what are you going to do with your $3 ?  
 hey guys ,  so i just called the powerball hotline ,  can you believe it ?  nobody won .  
maybe nobody won the jackpot ,  but there was this guy in here earlier ,  and he found the ticket on the street ,  right outside ,  and won $10 , 000  .   
hey !  
so ,  do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks ?  
well you can &apos;t !  we &apos;re booked solid for the next month !  
phoebe ,  what happened ?  
 have i got a surprise for you ?  pack your bags !  
what ?  no ,  i &apos;m taking monica to a romantic inn in vermont  !  
tell them i &apos;m a chef in a big new york restaurant !  
what are you doing here !  
great !  
listen phoebe .  .  .  
you know how much i love listening to your music ,  you know ,  but .  .  .  
this is kind of a classy place .  
 ok ,  say no more .  
it was hard !   
hey !  
oh .  .  . phoebe ?  maybe i wasn &apos;t clear before .  i really love listening to your music here ,  but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place .  
phoebe ,  it &apos;s not what you wear .  it &apos;s sort of your songs .  .  .  i just don &apos;t think you should play at the restaurant anymore .  
hey ,  so you guys ,  the funniest thing happened ,  at work .  .  .  
i didn &apos;t say your songs were not good enough .  
tiny portions ?  
phoebe ,  it &apos;s not about quantity .  
oh really ,  you want to talk about quality ?  have you heard of a key ?  it &apos;s what some people sing in .  
ok ,  so that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .  you know ,  when i &apos;m in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs ,  i &apos;m wearing ear plugs .  
you know what ?  i take back what i said before .  you keep playing at the restaurant ,  because with your music driving people inside ,  my bar sales are going up like crazy .  
thank god ,  it &apos;s just you !  i thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall .  
ok ,  you have to stop playing now .  
oh yeah ?  ok ,  let &apos;s settle this ,  come on !  
by a show of hands ,  how many of you were bothered by this woman &apos;s singing outside ?   
alright ,  let me ask you this question the music was fine ,  but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant ?   .  
ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone ?   
excuse us !   alright here &apos;s a question so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now ?   
i &apos;m sorry .  .  .  
ooohh .  .  .  hey !  wanna stick around and i &apos;ll whip you up some dinner ?  
yeah !  as long as it &apos;s free !  food here is ridiculously over - p .  .  .   
i could fall asleep at a play .  
yeah ,  it does sound interesting ,  i mean ,  to listen to a woman complain for two hours ,  i don &apos;t think it gets bett .  .  .   
 oh ,  hey you guys !  this is charlie !  charlie ,  this is phoebe and my sister ,  monica .  
yeah ,  charlie is gonna be joining my department .  
well ,  i think he &apos;s a little out there ,  but he does have some interesting ideas .  .  .  
 ranion &apos;s theory of species variegation ?  
ok professor or detective ?  
yeah ,  and he does it every year !  that &apos;s why he &apos;s sending you to that play !  that &apos;s why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory !  
 hey you guys ,  i &apos;m turning in .  have fun .  
oh yeah that &apos;s what you want  -  my inhibitions lowered .  
 oh my god ,  can you believe we are surrounded by all this ?  i can barely control myself .  
huh .  .  .  huh .  .  .  what a loser !  some more wine ?   
 oh great !  after i finish my wine i &apos;m going to blow my .  .  .  eh .  average - sized brains out .  
of course you would ,  your brains are smaller than mine !  !   man ,  i can &apos;t compete with the guys she goes out with ,  they are so out of my league !  oh my god !  
oh much ,  much worse .  i did my impression of joan rivers as one of the earliest amphibians .  .  .    &quot; can we walk &quot;  ?   oh ,  you .  .  .  you like that ?  
it &apos;s actually a 1 , 000 , 000$ prize .  
yeah ,  maybe .  i do have my whole career in front of me .  i mean ,  i can still win a nobel prize .  although the last two papers i &apos;ve written were widely discredited .  
and sexy .  
yeah ,  you &apos;re right ,  thanks pheebs ,  i &apos;m gonna go find her .  
oh ,  i don &apos;t know ,  they seem to have a shared interest in each other &apos;s tonsils .  .  .  
hey !  
oh ,  oh !  wow ,  i love those !  where did you get them ?  
 phoebe ,  shania twain is still alive !

oh my god !  oh my god thats awful !  what did you think of the house ?   
i knew he couldn &apos;t be with a woman for 45 minutes !  !  
when we found out that we &apos;re gonna get this baby ,  chandler and i started talking and we decided that we didn &apos;t want to raise a kid in the city .  
 so you wanna buy a house in the 50 &apos;s ?  
 it &apos;s so sweet .  it really is .  it has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there &apos;s these old maple trees .  .  .   
well ,  it is ,  all right ?  when we were out there is screwing this woman ,  but man this would be a nice place to live !

funny ,  because i was just gonna go across the hall and write that on chandler .  
ok ,  you guys ,  i dont mean to make things worse ,  but umm ,  i dont want to live with rachel anymore .  
whoa - whoa - whoa ,  phoebe you gotta take her !  yknow ,  i - i - i said some really bad stuff about her ,  but yknow rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate .  she gets tons of catalogs and umm ,  shell fold down the pages of the things she thinks that id like .  
yeah ,  i do .  i - i do ,  do that .  
rachel &apos;s right .  this is where you guys belong .  
yeah ,  we &apos;re gonna let you be alone .  
ooh !  oh wow this is so beautiful .

oh ,  d &apos;you like it ?  
what ?  
pheebs ,  i .  .  .  there isn &apos;t gonna be any flying about !  we actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that .  
seriously pheebs ,  it &apos;s not gonna be that kind of a party .  
 uh !  the police !  
so where &apos;s the young lady who i &apos;m supposed to take  downtown !   
all right ,  somebody show me where to plug in my box ,  and we &apos;ll get this party started !   whaaaa .  .  .   here ?  all right .  
yeah ?  
all right ,  look ,  we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find !  
oh my god ,  this man is gonna get naked in my apartment !  
whoa ,  whoa ,  whoa   .  she cringed !  
you were talking about me before !  look ,  i don &apos;t need this !  i &apos;m outta here !  where &apos;s my hat ?   look ,  i &apos;ve been in this business for a long time !  
now if you just pay me my three hundred dollars ,  i &apos;ll be on my way !  
no ,  that &apos;s ok ,  let &apos;s me just get my check book !  
didn &apos;t do anything ?  i took a bus all the way from hoboken .  i climbed  .  .  .  i dunno .  .  .  like a billion stairs .  .  .  it &apos;s not like i can take them two at a time !  
well ,  look  -  it &apos;s not my fault if you &apos;re too uptight to appreciate the male form in all it &apos;s glory .  
i may have borrowed this from my nephew ,  but let me assure you ,  what &apos;s underneath   .  .  .  is all man .  
what &apos;s the matter ?  you never saw a 50 year old stripper cry before ?  
so maybe something in an office .  
you know ,  actually that &apos;s not a bad idea .  i can do it out of my apartment .  i don &apos;t think my mom would mind .  
yeah ,  yeah ,  yeah .  .  .  this is so weird .  i mean ,  you never know when it &apos;s gonna be your last dance .  and i didn &apos;t even get a chance to finish it .

ooh .  .  .  she backed out .  
i made her .   steel drums don &apos;t really say  &quot; elegant wedding &quot;  .  nor does marjorie &apos;s overwhelming scent .  
hey !
