<phoebe> hmm ,  something bad to tell rachel bad news for rachel ,  what could that be ?  !  
<phoebe> ross ,  its not that big a deal !  so youll been divorced three times ,  youll still have a life ,  youll go on dates 
<phoebe> ross ,  youre being ridiculous !  okay ?  you are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces !  
<phoebe> yknow thats really fair .  yknow ?  most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60 .  ross ,  nobody cares about this except you !  this - this embarrassment thing is all in your head !  here ,  ill show you !  come here .  
<phoebe>  hi !  hi !  listen ,  my friend ross is about to be divorced for the third time ,  but wouldnt you date him ?  
<phoebe> okay ,  so what do you think ladies ?  who wouldnt be interested ?  who wouldnt want to date him ?  
<phoebe> okay ,  what about you ?   wouldnt you want a date ?  
<phoebe>  whatever !  what about you meg ?  
<phoebe>  she said ,   &quot; hes obviously still in love with this rachel girl .  &quot;   
<phoebe> well ,  i thought you loved her when you - when you married her .  
<phoebe> hey !  you could do a lot worse than joey tribbiani !  !  
<phoebe> yes ,  and now hes using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her .  i must say ,   &quot; well done !  &quot;  bravo meg .  
<phoebe> so ?  did you get the annulment ?  
<phoebe> i knew it !  because you love rachel .  
<phoebe> yeah ,  complicated cause of the love .  
<phoebe> ive never been more convinced of your love for her .  
<phoebe> oh we do ,  but not just yet .  
<phoebe> okay umm ,  well ,  first chandler and monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way .  yeah .  but it wont work out .  
<phoebe> i know .  then ,  im gonna marry chandler for the money and youll marry rachel and have the beautiful kids .  
<phoebe> but then we ditch those two and thats when we get married .  well have chandlers money and rachels kids and getting custody will be easy because of rachels drinking problem .  
<phoebe> i dont want to go into the whole thing ,  but umm ,  we have words and 
<phoebe> hey !  check it out !  this is unbelievable !  joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes !   
<phoebe> uh - huh ,  what ?  
<phoebe> oh !  
<phoebe> well ,  that would be great but then what do we do about denise ?  
<phoebe> my roommate .  
<phoebe> yes ,  denise .  denise !  
<phoebe> maybe because you never listen to anything that i say .  i talk about her all the time !  denise !  !  !  !  !  
<phoebe> so ,  what did rachel say when you told her you were still married to her ?  
<phoebe> you didnt tell her did you ?  
<phoebe> of course not ,  because youre in love with her .  
<phoebe> what do you mean ,  comforted her ?  
<phoebe> ah - ha !  a classic sign of love ,  the hug !  
<phoebe> yeah ,  not in your case lovey loverson .   
<phoebe> okay ,  just tell me this ,  did you or did you not smell her hair ?  
<phoebe> ninety percent of a womens pheromones come out the top of her head !  thats why ,  thats why women are shorter .  so that men will fall in love when they hug them !   oh come on ross ,  youre a scientist .  
<phoebe>  okay ,  whatever you say .  but just be careful ,  all right ?  rachels not in the same place you are .  
<phoebe> okay ,  i didnt understand that ,  but yknow ,  maybe thats cause you were speaking the secret language of love !   
<phoebe> shhhhhh !  im swamped right now .  
<phoebe> umm ,  im trying to move that pencil .   
<phoebe> it worked !  
<phoebe> wait ,  no ,  look at this !    &quot; two bedroom ,  two bath ,  must be non - smoker ,  satan worshipers okay  &quot;  oh ,  yeah ,  but its on the ground floor .

<phoebe> to kill bob ?  ?  
<phoebe> no ,  mike ,  i don &apos;t want to kill him !  i thought we were just gonna capture him and ,  and you know ,  set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl .

<phoebe> yeah ,  ok .  i guess you &apos;re right .  allright ,  so we should just give them away .  but to nice families ,  with children ,  and reduced fat wheat thins .  they &apos;re bob &apos;s favorites .  
<phoebe> you must think i &apos;m crazy .  
<phoebe> good .  it &apos;s just so hard ,  it &apos;s hard for me to  .  .  .  let them go .  i guess it just brings back memories ,  you know ,  from  .  .  .  when i gave birth to my brother &apos;s triplets and i had to give them up .   i haven &apos;t told you about that yet ,  have i ?  
<phoebe>  hey

<phoebe> oh !  
<phoebe> no !  i definitely don &apos;t wanna get married .  no i just wanted to make sure you didn &apos;t want to too .  whew !  coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there &apos;s gonna be hell to pay mister !  
<phoebe> yeah i get that .

<phoebe> someday .  
<phoebe> i haven &apos;t exactly had a normal life and i never really felt i was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it &apos;s my turn some of the regular stuff .  
<phoebe> because i just didn &apos;t know how much i wanted it .  and i love you ,  and i wanted to live with you .  
<phoebe> but i don &apos;t think i can !  it was ok to move in when i didn &apos;t know what was gonna happen ,  but i can &apos;t move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen .

<phoebe> ok .  i mean i know i did the right thing .  you know ,  mike never wants to get married and i shouldn &apos;t be in a relationship that has no future .  .  .  but .  .  .  pretty soon i &apos;m gonna miss him so much .  i &apos;m gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that .  
<phoebe>  unless .  .  .  maybe it &apos;s too crazy about this .  .  .  alright so .  .  .  you know ,  there is no future .  .  .  but that doesn &apos;t mean we still can &apos;t have fun .  you know what ?  forget what i said .  
<phoebe> that was a test and you just failed .  
<phoebe> i gotta call him .  just to talk to him ,  there &apos;s no harm in that .  
<phoebe> here .

<phoebe> yeah !  now ,  how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at city hall ?  
<phoebe> well ,  i think you &apos;re gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one

<phoebe> hey ,  thats not fair !  a persons wedding is important !  and especially to me !  ok ?  i didnt have a graduation party !  and i didnt go to prom .  and i spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to kill me or whatever .  so i deserve a real celebration and i am not gonna let some sweaty little man make me feel badly about it .  
<phoebe>  oh !  it ended okay .  one of my friends shot him .  
<phoebe> yeah ,  i really do .  you know ,  i had nothing growing up .   just like the kids i took the money from .

<phoebe> and if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time ,  my friend hasn &apos;t shot anyone in a really long time .  
<phoebe> yeah ,  because you know what ,  it &apos;s .  .  .  it &apos;s all about the children .
