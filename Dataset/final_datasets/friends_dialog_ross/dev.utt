you &apos;re welcome .  i remember when i first came to this city .  i was fourteen .  my mom had just killed herself and my step - dad was back in prison ,  and i got here ,  and i didn &apos;t know anybody .  and i ended up living with this albino guy who was ,  like ,  cleaning windshields outside port authority ,  and then he killed himself ,  and then i found aromatherapy .  so believe me ,  i know exactly how you feel .
