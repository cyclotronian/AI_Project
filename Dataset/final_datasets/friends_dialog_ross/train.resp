<ross> yes ,  i do have a laundry room in my building ,  um ,  but there &apos;s a .  .  .  .  rat problem .  apparently they &apos;re attracted to the dryer sheets ,  and they &apos;re goin &apos; in fine ,  but they &apos;re comin &apos; out all .  .  .  .  fluffy .  anyway ,  say ,  sevenish ?  
<ross> it &apos;s laundry .  the thinking through is minimal .

<ross> ok ,  ok ,  now what is wrong with my snuggles ?  what ,  it says i &apos;m a sensitive ,  warm kinda guy ,  you know ,  like a warm ,  fuzzy bear .  ok ,  i can pick something else up on the way .

<ross>  uh ,  that ,  that ,  that would be a judgment call .

<ross> marcel ,  stop humping the lamp !  stop humping !  now marcel ,  come back -   come here ,  marcel -  
<ross> what ?  it &apos;s ,  it &apos;s just a phase .  
<ross> would you all relax ?  it &apos;s not that big a deal .  
<ross> what ?  
<ross> at the vet .  
<ross> she says marcel &apos;s humping thing &apos;s not a phase .  apparently he &apos;s reached sexual maturity .  
<ross> she says as time goes on ,  he &apos;s gonna start getting agressive and violent .  
<ross> i &apos;m gonna have to give him up .  commercial break 
<ross> i know .  i know .  i mean ,  one day ,  he &apos;s this little thing ,  and before you know it ,  he &apos;s this little thing i can &apos;t get off my leg .  
<ross> no ,  no .  the vet says unless he &apos;s in a place where he has regular access to some .  .  .  monkey lovin ,  &apos; he &apos;s just gonna get vicious .  i &apos;ve just gotta get him into a zoo .  
<ross> well ,  we &apos;re applying to a lot of them .  naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos ,  y &apos;know ,  like ,  uh ,  san diego .  .  .  right ?  but that might just be a pipe dream ,  because ,  y &apos;know ,  he &apos;s out of state .  uh ,  my vet ,  uh ,  knows someone at miami ,  so that &apos;s a possibility .  
<ross> what ?  !  are you insane ?  this woman stole from you .  she stole .  she &apos;s a stealer .  
<ross> yeah ,  which she probably stole from some cheerleader .  
<ross> marcel !  marcel !  marcel ,  no !  good boy .  see ,  how can nobody want him ?  
<ross> yes .  
<ross> no - no ,  he &apos;s ,  he &apos;s very docile .

<ross> he &apos;s in !  oh ,  did you hear that ,  marcel ?  san diego .  san diego !  good ,  but if you give him to me ,  i &apos;ll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains .

<ross> no ,  i mean ,  look i dont know if anything is going to happen with us ,  again .  ever .  but i dont want to know that it - it never could .  so i stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector .  
<ross> youre welcome .    
<ross> you take care jill .  
<ross> i know what you mean ,  ive always wondered how different my life would be if - if id never gotten divorced .  
<ross> the first time !  no seriously ,  imagine if carol hadnt realized she was a lesbian .  
<ross> id bet id still be doing my kara - tay .   towards the end of our marriage i was doing a lot of kara - tay as a way of releasing the tension from yknow ,  not doing anything else physical .  
<ross> no ,  i just think monica was that fat .  
<ross> what ?  !  
<ross> hey ,  do you guys think that if all those things happened ,  wed still hang out ?  opening credits the usual opening credits .  oh no !  these credits are based on the world that would have been created had all of the above actually happened .  it starts out with all of them at the fountain sitting on the couch as fat monica runs up and sits on the arm of the couch ,  tilting the whole thing towards her .  it then goes on to show rachels still a shop - aholic and with barry .  fat monica is sweating while cooking and dancing while eating a donut .  phoebe as the wall street shark smoking while on two cell phones .  then theyre dancing in the fountain .  joey entering as dr .  drake remoray and meeting a groupie .  chandler trying to write as a bird does its business on his shoulder and falling asleep while typing .  ross doing some kara - tay and trying to get carol into bed .  and finally ,  some more dancing in the fountain ,  them all flexing ,  and the turning out the lamp and shutting off all the lights bit from the first season .  just remember one thing ,  this is an alternate universe .  everything from every other episode doesnt apply ,  for instance ,  ross and rachel have no history .  and in fact have not seen each other in years in this world . }

<ross> well ,  of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming ,  thats not enough .  look ,  i studying kara - tay for a long time ,  and theres a concept you should really be familiar with .  its what the japanese call  unagi .  
<ross> no ,  its a concept !  
<ross> all right ,  maybe it means that too 
<ross> yknow what ?  fine !  get attacked !  i dont even care !  
<ross> unagi is a state of total awareness .  okay ?  only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you !  
<ross>  all im saying is ,  its one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack ,  i dont know ,  like a  surprise !  !   
<ross> all right ,  you know that one was coming ,  but that doesnt mean you have unagi .   
<ross> yknow what  
<ross> no .  
<ross> so what are you gonna do ?  
<ross> a lesson in the importance of unagi .   
<ross> perhaps .  now im curious ,  at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass ?  
<ross> im sorry i had to take such drastic measures to make my point ,  but ilook ,  i just want you guys to be safe .   danger !  !  !  !  !   ahhh ,  huh ?  unagi .  
<ross>  chandler .  i sensed it was you .  
<ross> unagi .  im always aware .  
<ross> whats up ?  
<ross> oh ,  why dont you make her one of your little jokes .  
<ross> yknow what ?  shed - shed love this .   uh ,  its an exact replica of apollo 8 .  i made it in the sixth grade .

<ross> why not ?  
<ross> oh .    
<ross> its not something you are !  its something you have !

<ross> its a great class .  
<ross> yeah ,  yeah ,  i was watching .   umm ,  hey ,  a couple of questions though .  umm ,  about that - that - that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor ,  what - what - what - what would you do next ?

<ross> ok you .  .  . you really don &apos;t know what i am talking about ?  
<ross> ok !  last night after the party i saw rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony .  
<ross> right that &apos;s why i came over to talk about .  hum .  .  . i saw rachel kissing some guy on your balcony ,  even though there were no lights  !  
<ross> why .  .  . why should i ?  i mean if she wants to move on ,  that &apos;s fine !  
<ross> no i &apos;m serious .  i mean she wants to date people ?  fine !  i don &apos;t care but .  .  . at least she could have told me .  you know i .  .  . i &apos;ve been putting my life on hold and just concentrating on emma but if she wants to go out there kissing guys she barely knows ,  then so will i  !  very funny !  ross is gay !  ah !  ah !  
<ross> i don &apos;t know .  i mean i have plenty of opportunity .  just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me .  and then the other day on the subway a woman  &quot; accidentally &quot;  sat on my hand .  
<ross> well ,  and how about this ?  there is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter - departmental potluck dinner .  
<ross> not well .  i went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants .  
<ross> that &apos;s funny .  .  . do you think you &apos;ll ever work again ?  
<ross> i can &apos;t believe rachel just moved on and didn &apos;t say anything to me 
<ross> no no ,  about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar .  
<ross> no .  when he called ,  i .  .  . i threw the message away .  
<ross> you know what ?  enough !  enough talking !  i have to get moving !  hey check out those two blondes over there !  hey come with me !  
<ross> you don &apos;t have to do anything .  it will just be easier if it is the two of us ,  like college ,  remember ?  you .  .  . you break the ice with some kind of jokes so that they know you &apos;re the funny one and i swoop in with some interesting conversation ,  so they &apos;ll see that i &apos;m the brilliant ,  brooding ,  sexy one .  .  .  
<ross> don &apos;t you have to be at work ?  
<ross> hum .  .  . so .  .  . hum .  .  . oh hey i noticed you were reading the paper .  .  . another would you rather drown or be burnt alive ?  &quot;  
<ross> right ,  so that &apos;s a firm  &quot; no &quot;  .  i cannot believe this ,  i just keep striking out .  
<ross> this is great .  rachel &apos;s gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and i &apos;m gonna die alone .  
<ross> i know !   
<ross> but ,  whats great is that you dont mind talking about it .  
<ross> uh - ah !

<ross> oh ,  just this woman ive been seeing .  
<ross> yeah ,  didnt i mention that ?  yeah ,  i mean ,  we havent being going out for too long ,  but rather there is this amazing connection between us .  i - i mean ,  in fact just before you came in she called me her boyfriend .  i thought it was a little too soon ,  but it was also ,  you know ,  it was kinda nice .  
<ross> how great is this ?  you are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff .  oh ,  i am sorry michelle ,  thats my roommate ,  rachel .

<ross> i dont know ,  are we just kissing guys on balconies ?  
<ross> through the magic of sight !  i was here ,  putting our child to sleep .  .  .  
<ross> when i happened to look through the window and i see you kissing a guy you know ,  for what ?  a week ?  
<ross> ok ,  michelle ,  its time to go .  
<ross> ok .  
<ross> you know ,  if its meant to be ,  ill guess it .  bye ,  bye .

<ross> oh ,  really !  
<ross> oh ,  really !  
<ross> what about the guy from the bar ?  
<ross> the guy you gave your number to .  
<ross> because he called here looking for you .  so dont tell me this .  .  . this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing ,  ok ?  youve been out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now .  and you didnt even have the courtesy to tell me .  
<ross> what ?  
<ross> because i folded it up and put in my pants pocket .  do you .  .  . do you not look there ?  
<ross> i never gave it to you .  
<ross> i dont know .  
<ross> who am i ?  
<ross> i am the guy whos taking care of our baby while youre out at bars meeting guys !

<ross> yeah ,  uh ,  uh ,  ok ,  there &apos;s this great rare bookstore on madison avenue .  you know what ?  she loves architecture ,  you know what you should do ?  you should take a walk down fifth to the saint patrick &apos;s cathedral and there there &apos;s this great little pastry shop that she &apos;d love .  
<ross> but i &apos;m not !   .  you know what if you &apos;re in the mood for thai food .  .  .

<ross> ok ,  when you walk in the museum ,  take the right ,  that &apos;s the antiquities wing .  ancient egypt ,  mesopotamia ,  up to the byzantine empire .  
<ross> now ,  do you have any idea what you just said ?  
<ross> ok now ,  remember ,  when you get to the museum ,  monet is not spelt m - o - n - a - y .  i just .  .  .  i wrote that out phonetically for you .  
<ross> yeah ,  yeah that means .  .  .  you know ?  we just .  .  .  we don &apos;t have time for this .  
<ross> ok ,  but you know what ?  i gotta say ,  i &apos;m really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly !

<ross> what ?  
<ross> what ,  i mean ,  a little ,  but no ,  what ,  go on .  
<ross>  yeah .  but you know what ?  i think you should give joey a chance .  i mean ,  he &apos;s a great guy ,  and sure he doesn &apos;t know that much about art but you know ,  you can always talk about that with someone else .  
<ross> and if you think about it ,  i mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you .  you know ,  that &apos;s the kind of guy joey is .  
<ross> that was going to be my next argument .   
<ross> hey !  
<ross> glad i could help man .  
<ross>  hey ,  you guys !  
<ross> guess who &apos;s up for keynote speaker at the national paleontology conference ?

<ross>  what ?   
<ross>  what ?  no !  i am not going to give them ben !  
<ross>  i mean ,  we &apos;ve been accepting leakey &apos;s dates as a given ,  but if they &apos;re off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can  -  you can just throw most of our assumptions ,  you know ,  right in the trash .   so - so what i am saying is  -  is is that  is that the repercussions could be huge !  i mean ,  not just in palaeontology ,  but if - if you think about it ,  in evolutionary biology ,  uh ,  genetics ,  geology ,  uh ,  i mean ,  truly the mind boggles !   
<ross> oh ,  that &apos;s not what you want .  .  .  
<ross> joey !  hey ,  i need to talk to charlie .  is she there ?
