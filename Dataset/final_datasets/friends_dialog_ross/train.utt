ok ,  ross ,  could you just open your mind like this much ,  ok ?   wasn &apos;t there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat ?  and ,  up until like what ,  50 years ago ,  you all thought the atom was the smallest thing ,  until you split it open ,  and this like ,  whole mess of crap came out .  now ,  are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can &apos;t admit that there &apos;s a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this ?   
i can &apos;t believe you caved .

my parents called this afternoon to say they weren &apos;t coming .  
i mean ,  i knew they were having trouble with this whole thing ,  but they &apos;re my parents .  they &apos;re supposed to give me away and everything .  
and then susan and i got in this big fight because i said maybe we should call off the wedding ,  and she said we weren &apos;t doing it for them ,  we were doing it for us ,  and if i couldn &apos;t see that ,  then maybe we should call off the wedding .  i don &apos;t know what to do .

is there room on that step for a pathetic loser ?  
im so sorry .  
well ,  maybe you didnt want it to end ?  
you seem to really like her .  
ross ,  that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends ,  asking to hear stories about you ,  looking through monicas photo albums ,  i mean you dont do that if youre just in it for two weeks .  
yeah ,  you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport ,  and youre sitting here in the hallway with a 28 - year - old cheerleader with a fat lip .  
yeah .  
i dont know ,  it was you and a bunch of albino kids .

yeah that ,  plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything !  
do you love her ?  
you love her !

yeah ,  what were you trying to get her to do ?  !  
you play hard to get .  
it is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you .  and the reason why she couldnt ,  is because her feelings were so strong ,  it scared her .  now you go home and wait for her call ,  she could be calling you from the plane !  come on now go !  go !   
ross .  
it was dreadful .  i felt terrible about how i acted when you said those wonderful things .

she &apos;s right y &apos;know .  
hey ross ,  will you pass me that knife ?  
oh ,  it &apos;s okay .  you don &apos;t have to be so mean about it .

ooh !  thats good !  wow !  but now if you were pregnant ,  what would you  
hey !  
well umm ,  chandler and i are moving in together .  
okay ,  i gotta go find rachel but umm ,  if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesnt seem so bad ?   
hmm ,  something bad to tell rachel bad news for rachel ,  what could that be ?  !  
ross ,  its not that big a deal !  so youll been divorced three times ,  youll still have a life ,  youll go on dates 
ross ,  youre being ridiculous !  okay ?  you are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces !  
yknow thats really fair .  yknow ?  most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60 .  ross ,  nobody cares about this except you !  this - this embarrassment thing is all in your head !  here ,  ill show you !  come here .  
 hi !  hi !  listen ,  my friend ross is about to be divorced for the third time ,  but wouldnt you date him ?  
well ,  i dont care about the divorces either ,  but i wouldnt date him .  its just that hes obviously still in love with this rachel girl .  
 she said ,   &quot; hes obviously still in love with this rachel girl .  &quot;   
well ,  i thought you loved her when you - when you married her .  
hey !  you could do a lot worse than joey tribbiani !  !  
yes ,  and now hes using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her .  i must say ,   &quot; well done !  &quot;  bravo meg .  
you got married again .  
so thats your second marriage in two years .  
ross ,  i have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had i so much business from one client .  why dont you tell me what happened .  
 im sorry ,  is this the same rachel whos name you said at the altar in the second marriage ?  
oh ,  thats better then .  
i see .  have you considered therapy ?  
there are a couple of forms to fill out .  
and well need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh ,  sound mind .  
and well need you and rachel to testify before a judge .  
of course you did .  look ross ,  you cant get an annulment unless you and rachel are both there .  
 okay ,  bye !  
so ?  did you get the annulment ?  
i knew it !  because you love rachel .  
yeah ,  complicated cause of the love .  
ive never been more convinced of your love for her .  
i do not have feelings for rachel !  okay ?  !    
monica and chandler are really moving in here and i have to move out and everything is changing .  
thank you .  
hey .  
so ,  what did rachel say when you told her you were still married to her ?  
you didnt tell her did you ?  
of course not ,  because youre in love with her .  
what do you mean ,  comforted her ?  
ah - ha !  a classic sign of love ,  the hug !  
yeah ,  not in your case lovey loverson .   
okay ,  just tell me this ,  did you or did you not smell her hair ?  
ninety percent of a womens pheromones come out the top of her head !  thats why ,  thats why women are shorter .  so that men will fall in love when they hug them !   oh come on ross ,  youre a scientist .  
 okay ,  whatever you say .  but just be careful ,  all right ?  rachels not in the same place you are .  
wait ,  no ,  look at this !    &quot; two bedroom ,  two bath ,  must be non - smoker ,  satan worshipers okay  &quot;  oh ,  yeah ,  but its on the ground floor .

hes being silly ,  because he knows that we enjoy the silliness !  
ross ,  you were right before ,  it was just a stupid fight about a room .  
yeah ,  no ,  me neither .  
now if you want to receive e - mails about my upcoming shows ,  then please give me money so i can buy a computer .  
umm ,  well lets see monica and chandler are occupied .  
no ,  the other thing .  i really think its great they work things out .  
hey ,  can i borrow the key to your house so i can run across the street and make a copy ?  
thank you .   now are you sure ?  because once i make a copy ,  theres no turning back .  
umm ,  listen ,  ross do you really think this moving in with rachel is a good idea ?  
yeah well ,  maybe you should go back !  okay ?  rachel moves in ,  and before you know it youre right where you dont want to be !  back together !  
thats not gonna work out !  then shes gonna come home all weepy and youll be tellin her ,   &quot; oh thats okay .  youll find someone .  &quot;  and then ,  bamn !  she finds you !  
i am telling you ross ,  she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again !  now ,  is that what you want ?  
or not .  uh ,  rach ,  why dont you just move in with me ?

oh hi !  
oh thatd be great .  sure !  
oh ,  this is it .  this whats gonna kill me .

why dont you open with a joke ?  
wait a minute ,  hold the phone !  youre not talking about chuckles university ?  !  
ross ,  hey you know what might make it less boring ?  
oh - ooh - ooh !  yknow whats a good visual aide ?  
why not ?  !  
yeah .   nice try !   
howd the lecture go ?  
wow ,  thats great ross ,  im sorry we werent more supportive before .  
that youre not funny or sexy ?  
yeah ,  we could .  oh hey look !  theres some kappa kappa deltas !  i was a kappa .   hey sisters !   wow ,  we really are bitches .   
what the hell are you doing ?  !  
yeah ,  and not a very good one .  
will you - will you please ?   paleontology department here .  
oh .  
 monica gellerrr .   
 oh ,  you can have an accent and i cant ?  !   top o the morning to ya laddies !  
yeah that seems fair .  we never use them .  
yeah ,  i mean ,  come on ross ,  no one will even notice .  i mean theyre probably not even listening !  
of course theyre listening to you !  everybody listens to you .  
 all right ,  keep going .  we are phasing the accent out ,  phasing it out .  so without out re - testing the results in the laboratory  the team would never have identified  the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis  .  were there any questions at this point ?   yes .   
ross !  !  are you crazy ?  !  i am still your wife !  !  what ,  were you just never gonna tell me ?  !  !  what the hell is wrong with you ?  !  !  !  !  ugh ,  i could just kill you !  !  !  !  
i cannot believe that you didnt tell me that we are still married !  !  
ross !  
okay ,  let me just jump in and ask ,  at what point did you think this was a successful marriage ?  
okay ,  this is inexcusable .  i am shocked to my very core !  
 oh look who it is ,  my husband .  the apple of my eye .  
well sure ,  if you say youre gonna take care of everything i have no reason to doubt you .  give me those forms !   all right ,  now im gonna do this my way and i dont want to hear a peep out of you !  
ross !  yknow what ,  i just gotwhy ?  why did you do this ?  !  
i dont wanna hear  &quot; three failed marriages !  &quot;  
well ,  yknow what ?  thanks to you im half way there !  ugh !  oh !  i am so mad !  ross ,  i dont think i have ever been this angry !  
so based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that mr . _geller is mentally unstable .  
and based on the fact that mr . _geller is intravenous drug user .  
uh yes ,  heroin and crack .  
now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage ?  
and finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage .  well ,  that makes sense since youre gay and addicted to heroin .  
that wont be necessary .  
well ,  based on what i heard ,  you two certainly dont qualify for an annulment .  if you two dont want to be together youll have to file for divorce .  
 what ?  !  me ?  !  what about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense !  
all right look lady here is the deal ,  i came here for an annulment and i am not leaving here until i get one !  
this is totally your fault !  
well ,  you ripped the paper out of the court reporters machine !  !  
dont call us that !   
 oh honey thank god youre home ,  i was getting worried .  
oh ,  little xs !  great !  that makes up for everything !  
oh ,  name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one !  
hey !  wait a minute !  that was different !  i did those things because i was in love with you !  
yeah !  right !   
nothing .   
uh - hmm .   
okay ross ,  werewait a minute .  umm ,  i uh ,  i kinda have a little confession .  
well ,  yknow this whole marriage thing ,  kinda my idea .  
well ,  remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married ?  
and uh ,  yeah ,  i didnt really ,  i didnt want to say anything ,  but it kinda it just ,  it kinda kept coming back to me ,  and umm ,  remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes .  and uh ,  and i thought it would be funnier if we got married .  so as a ,  as a compromise we decided first to get married ,  and then  to eat a lot of grapes .  so umm ,  sorry i got us into this mess .  
yeah ,  dont push it though .  
i know .  i always thought if you and i got married ,  it would be the one that stuck .  and it wouldnt be a secret ,  and we wouldnt have our wedding dinner at pizza hut .   
no ,  it was on the house ,  it was ,  it was a newlywed special .  
hey ,  thanks ross ,  for taking care of all of this .  
im gonna need a copy of those .  
hey !  
well ,  instead of just hanging out ,  we figure wed do nothing .  
i dont know ross ,  not if youre gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist .  
okay fine ,  now ross 
 ive got ben .  
is he really coming ?  because i can see right into your apartment !

you guys ,  i &apos;m telling you ,  when she runs ,  she looks like a cross between kermit the frog and the six million dollar man .  
why don &apos;t you just be straight with her ?  tell her the truth .  
hey !  
no ,  wait phoebe .   
what does it look like i &apos;m doing ?  i am cleaning !  
authorization ?  i don &apos;t need that .  i &apos;m gonna put everything back .

she &apos;s not gonna care if i put her stuff back in the same stupid place .  
she is gonna recognize that i did a nice thing and - and ,  appreciate it .  
i see ,  i see ,  y - y - you &apos;re trying to freak me out .  
it &apos;s ,  all good !  okay bye - bye mon !   she &apos;s - she &apos;s gonna kill me .  
we should start with the big stuff .  yknow ?  that &apos;ll be the easiest .  uh ,  let &apos;s start with the couch .   i got it .   
what are you talking about ?  the couch is perfectly in line with the carpet .  and then i can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the .  .  .  ok ,  ok ,  here &apos;s what we do ,  we just uh ,  move the couch closer to the coffee table .  
ok well here ,  we &apos;ll just move the coffee table closer to the couch .  
 look ,  what am i gonna do ?  i &apos;m not flirting but still ,  i &apos;m drawing her to me like  -  like a moth to a flame !   what the hell &apos;s going on over here ?  !  ?  !  ?   monica &apos;s gonna kill you !  look i need your help ,  i have to do something to - to repel this woman !  wait a minute ,  wait a minute ,  you guys repel women all the time .  
no - no - no i &apos;ve seen it happen ,  you - you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it .  what &apos;s your secret ?  
oh no ,  yes we do my man .  remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the irish potato famine ?  
yeah ,  monica doesn &apos;t like that either ,  maybe i should stop doing that .  
this is great ,  this is great ,  what else ,  what else ?  
and they don &apos;t like it when you explain why your jokes are funny .  
man ,  i &apos;m so lucky i have monica .  
okay ,  is this lamp in the same place ?  
what ?  !  
 i couldn &apos;t say that i was naked because she &apos;s allowed too see me naked .  
why is ross naked ?

 okay ,  maybe this will make your teeth look less white .   nope .  okay ,  colors that dont work are blue ,  yellow ,  green ,  red ,  black ,  white ,  orange ,  and purple .  
hey ross ,  maybe if your skin was lighter .  your teeth wouldnt look so bright .  
im just saying ,  if we put just a little bit of makeup on you .  
ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working .  
please .  half the guys out there have makeup on .

so ,  what do you think ?  
i got glasses !

oh ,  just so you know ,  you - you have to let him win .  
oh no problem ,  maybe ill play with my left hand .  
 because im normal !  that was the one legacy my grandmother left me ,  and i know you wanted it as an engagement present .  
dont worry about it pheebs .  
okay ,  we owe you a present .  
i cant believe that !  now the only thing left of my grandmothers legacy is this crumb .   i wish you a long and happy marriage .

guys ?  
why do they put so much steam in there ?  !  
not that big a deal ?  there there was touching of things .  
i dont want him to tell this story for years .  
i wasnt escaping .  
i was trying to help out a squirrel .  
 all right ,  im off to see your dad .  
look ,  i figured i would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore ,  and i figure the best way to do that is face to faceand by face i dont mean his lap .  and by face ,  i dont mean my ass .   
i dont know .  yknow ,  they didnt get us anything .  
 hey .  
well ,  lesson learned !  rachel is mean !

no ,  just a friday night .   
yeah ,  but not as good as batch 17 .  
the ones we had right after you almost threw up .  
are there any more from the good batch ?  cause we could just work off of those .

well ,  ive tried everything .  i give up .  i guess im not gonna be the mom who makes the worlds best chocolate cookies .  i do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe .  kids love that right .

 hey ross !  so ,  i was checking out the uh ,  real estate section 
look at this .   
i cant believe mom and dad are selling the house !  
i cant believe i still dont know what happened to the window in the attic !   
well ,  after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you ,  its time the velvet ropes came down .  
oh please !  dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after i moved out !  i gotta say ,  a tanning bed and a stack of victorias secret catalogues ,  not a gym !  
as much as they love you ?  
 hey .  
ugh ,  i hate this year !  
oh thats right !  
yeah and yeah ,  and it would probably be better than the last telephone job i had .  yknow ,  i probably wouldnt have to say spank as much .   
im here !  
hi .  god ,  it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work .  
well ,  its time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling .  
i used to love to play restaurant .  
so ,  i think your boxes are over here .   
i dont know .  they - they must be your mothers ,  but please ,  please dont ask her .  ill throw these away .   
oh look ,  look theres your old makeup kit !  
well ,  the white seems to be untouched .   uh - oh .  
yknow how the garage floods every spring ?  
i think i accidentally used monicas boxes to keep the water away from the porsche .  
you dont secretly smoke do you ?  
well ,  shell understand right ?  its not like i did it on purpose .  
oh my god ,  does she really thinks that ?  
well i dont know ,  i - i suppose we may have favored you unconsciously ,  you were a medical marvel !  the doctor said your mother could 
really ?  
great !  
sure !  
 this couldve been hers !  
hey guys !  hey !  
 thats a good one !  do you hear that ross ?  three days !  
 okay .  so ,  which boxes are mine ?  
okay .   oh !  a coloring book !   
 really ?  wow !  it looks like i had some trouble staying inside the lines .  
wow !  look at this !   i cant believe i even fit into this shirt !  oh ,  this is yours .   
 this isnt mine .   hey ,  this isnt ,  this isnt my stuff !  ugh ,  ross !   these are your boxes !  where are my boxes ?  
what ?  
oh ,  this is terrible !  everything is destroyed !  look at this .   it obviously meant enough for me to save it ,  and i dont even know what it is !  ohh ,  its still soft .   what do you think this is ?  
 what ?  !  
wait ,  youre giving me your porsche ,  youre kidding me right ?  !  
all right !  
chocolate - chip pancakes !   
come on rach !  look ,  turning thirty is not that big a deal .  
yknow ,  im still 29 in guam .  
well ,  doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid ,  like ross .  
hey !  that was a practical purchase !  i needed that car for transportation !  okay ?  i - i have a child !  one of the better british sports cars ever made .  of course ,  better is a relative term .  which reminds me of a joke .  why dont the british make computers ?  because they couldnt figure out how to make them leak oil .  anyway ,  the gang is all staring at his new purchase . ] 
ross ,  a sports car ?  wouldnt it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there ?  
hey ,  whats the horsepower on this thing ?  
oh ,  well get in line missy .   so ,  can i have a ride stud ?  
hop in .   get ready for the smoothest ride of your life .   anyway ,  this being new york he is parallel parked on a street with the car in front of him only inches ahead of his bumper ,  likewise with the car behind him .  hes completely boxed in and cant move more than two inches .  he tries to get out several times by bumping the bumpers of both cars to no avail . ) 
well actually 
monicas wasted .  
 a scooter !   
well ,  i feel fine ,  but i think youre bumming out the rest of the kids .  
no ,  so i dont have to get married until im 33 !  thats three years ,  thats three whole yearsoh ,  wait a minute though .  ill need a year and a half to plan the wedding ,  and id like to know the guy for a year ,  year and a half before we get engaged which means i need to meet the guy by the time im thirty .  
 im telling you its like watching bambi learn how to walk .  
you are so handsome !  i wanna make love to you right here ,  right now !   
speech !  come on monica !  
ross ,  i really dont think

all - all right !   start it up !  lets go !  
 woohoo !   
 ohh 
ohhh

do you mind telling us what it is ?  
oh well ,  theyre killing off one of the characters on the show ,  and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body .  
 yes ,  its a highly controversial procedure .  
well ,  i think its ridiculous that you havent had sex in three and a half months .  
oh ,  tell me about it .  and shes been on the show forever ,  its gonna be really hard to fill her shoes .  
oh no thanks .  i dont like anything from my scottish heritage .  
well its just my entire family was run out of scotland by vikings .  anyway ,  lots of bad memories .   
no !  no - no theyre not .  theyre still very angry !  but yknow chandler is also half - swedish .  you know what the swedish people are famous for ?  sitting down and being quiet .  
 you can not play bagpipes at the wedding !  !  
we heard you play all the way from your apartment !  
thats not really important right now .  what is important is; while we appreciate the gesture ,  we just dont feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding .  
because we hate them .  
we have heard you play .  
 i can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks .  
no !

yeah ,  little eric .  
so youve just married the one time then ?

have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey ?  !  
fine !  have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants ?  !

uh - hmm .  
ross ,  shes 25 years old .

because purvy perverson over here cant stop staring at her .  
you were staring about eight inches south of there .  
hey ross !  
 its been so long !  last time i saw you ,  you were setting up your tent in line to see return of the jedi .  
ah yeah ,  sorry about that .  
thanks for letting me stay here !  i mean monicas place was nice ,  but her fiance sure stares a lot .  
oh my god !  you do a great chandler !  
well ,  maybe after we get reacquainted uh ,  you can do me .  
im all done .  
i guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together .  
ill always remember that summer ,  because its when i got all of these freckles .   
it took you that long to figure it out ,  huh ?  
hey !  what the hell are you doing ?  !   
shut up ,  that was my friend melissa from college .  
 they were lovers .  
no we werent !  it was nothing !  it was one night ,  senior year we went to a party ,  had a lot of sangria and yknow ,  ended up kissing for a bit .  
a freakish thin date with a hanger for her head ?  
what ?  
you cant wear that !  im wearing the famous tux !  james bonds tux !  
soif you wear that youll make mine less special .  
please ,  dont take away my cool thing .  please ?  !  pretty please ?  !  
look ,  its my wedding day okay ?  if you were getting married i would never do anything to upset you .  
you just carry that around ?  
between you and 
a little tight ?  i could see double - oh and seven in those pants .  
well ,  does that mean that youre not going to be wearing yours ?  
 let me try it on !  
 okay .  holy double - vented comfort batman !   whats this ?  
an invitation for the at first sight premiere ?  oh my god !  val kilmer didnt wear this in batman !  he wore it to the premiere of some tooty - fruity love story where he played a blind guy !  
all right ,  uh  oh hey ,  youve done this before ross ,  well what did you say when you made up your vows ?  
oh !  yeah !    
yeah ,  im not sure i can do that .   
dear god !  this parachute is a knapsack !    
hey !  
hey ,  what have you guys been up to ?  
how is  &quot; monica ,  i love your sweet ass ,  &quot;  inappropriate ?  
well lets just say its .  .  shes lucky she has a sweet ass ,  cause shes not so good at the writing .  
well lets just hope it works .  yknow ,  nine out of ten marriages end in divorce ?  
 has it been that long ?  !  
yes ,  i know !  and joey knows !  but ross doesn &apos;t know ,  so you have to stop screaming !  !  
 hi !  !  hi !  
nothing !  oh god ,  we &apos;re just so excited that you want to get this apartment !  
yes ,  and we &apos;d appreciate it if no one told him yet .   
i dont want them to move to a volvo dealership !  
hey ,  who &apos;s this little naked guy ?  
aww ,  look at the little thing .  
who are those people ?  
let &apos;s see ,  1939 .  .  .  yeah ,  24 ,  25 ?  
ooh ,  look - look - look - look - look !  i got monica naked !  
what ?  i dont get it .   
okay ,  what do you guys think ?  
you really like it ?  
i stole monicas and changed the name .  
hey !  
yeah ,  well hes my brother !  and plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it .  
 hey !  
great !  well rachel ,  the reason why i wont let you drive the porsche is because youre a terrible driver .  there !  that wasnt about the wedding .  
take the top down did ya ?  
come on ross give me the keys !  monica does not know what shes talking about !  i am an excellent driver !  
well in high school ,  that added up to head cheerleader .   
i think shes checking out your beehive ross .  
gimme the keys !  
well no brush !  
my god !  
just washing the windshield .   
oh .  of the steering wheel .  does anyone know why that is ?  its a tradition left over from porsches racing history .  the worlds greatest endurance race is the 24 hours of lemans .  which is in france and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on saturday through the dark of night and finishes at noon on sunday .  in the 60s lemans had a unique start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the track .  at the start of the race ,  the drivers would run across the track ,  get in the car ,  buckle up ,  start the car ,  and drive off .  porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that took .  since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the steering wheel ,  that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat - belts ,  put the car in gear and start it .  the drivers left hand did nothing .  porsche in order to save a few seconds in a 24 - hour race; moved the ignition switches to the left side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while grabbing the seat - belts with his right hand .  thats why every porsche car built since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel . } 
look ross ,  if youre so freaked out ,  just get in the car !  
all right .   
what are you doing ?  !  get in the front !  
god .  i forgot how much i love driving .  i have got to get my license renewed .  
oh ross youre so tense !  you just gotta relax ,  okay ?  just need to relax all right ?  just need to relax  
uh - oh .   
really ?  you think so ?  
okay .  switch places with me !  switch places with me !  come on !  ill go under ,  you go over !  
oh come on ross !  !

oops sorry ,  my mistake .  
wow !  
yeah ?  well you look phenomenal .  
oh well

fourth gear !  !   
well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two oclock position .

we &apos;re gonna have sex .  
let me put it this way .  we &apos;re having sex whether you &apos;re here or not .  
hey .  
 hi ,  good morning lover .  i gotta say after last night ,  i &apos;m a little weak in the knees .  
what !  ?  you faked it ?  
i tried ,  but apparantly singing  &quot; i will survive &quot;  in a helium voice  -  not helping .   
shhh don &apos;t say that loud ,  gunther &apos;s gonna want to hug me .  
hi .   
oh ,  wow ,  molly is just great !  
am i the only one who doesn &apos;t think that she &apos;s hot ?  ross ?  
what &apos;s the big deal with her ?  maybe she &apos;s attractive in an obvious kind of way .  
 i &apos;m gonna take her back to the appartment .  
so ,  what ,  you think i &apos;m just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable ?   yeah ,  sounds about right .  
oh ,  man ,  why did have to go and say that for ?  now that you told me i can &apos;t have it makes me want her even more !  
yes !  
seriously dude ,  3 years ago .  
you don &apos;t trust him ?  
is this really your long term plan ,  for me to run interference ?  because i could get a job any day now .  
allright ,  fine ,  but don &apos;t blame me if it doesn &apos;t work .  because you know as well as i do that once joey sets his mind on something ,  more often than not ,  he &apos;s going to have sex with it .  
picturing that tree ?  
well i &apos;m sorry rachel ,  but i &apos;m not like you ,  ok ?  not everyone can afford help .    
 i &apos;m sorry ,  i got a little occupied .  
molly  .  .  .  people don &apos;t study acting  .  .  .

 will the stable boy never get the princess ?  ?  
hi ,  is molly here ?  
 hey !  guys ,  this is tabatha  .   i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .  
hey !  
sure !  just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you !  do you believe that who ever did something over here last night did what they did or didn &apos;t do  .  .  . i mean come on !  !  
no !  
our balcony ?  seriously ?  that &apos;s so funny because i told monica we should put lights on our balcony .  and she said  &quot; no ,  no .  it &apos;s too cold ,  nobody will go out there .  &quot;  and i said  &quot; maybe if we put some light out there they will &quot;  
so are you gonna .  .  . talk to her ?  
you know when  &quot; that &apos;s fine &quot;  sounds true when someone yells it and spits !  
no no no .  good .  so you &apos;re moving on ?  do you have any idea where you &apos;re moving ?  
dude ,  don &apos;t rub my face in your crazy single life !  
hey it &apos;s the most eligible man in ny .  how &apos;s the moving on going ?  
well maybe you &apos;re going about this the wrong way .  you know i mean think about it .  single white male ,  divorced three times ,  two illegitimate children .  the personal ad writes itself .  .  .  .  
what are doing ?  you know i can only dish it out !  
maybe she didn &apos;t move on ,  you know .  .  . maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one - time birthday thing 
did she go out with him ?  
ah !  the high road .  .  .  
are you trying to get everybody divorced ?  
i thought i had to make the jokes !  
oh come on !  hello !  hi !  my name is chandler ,  here &apos;s my friend ross right here ,  and we were wondering you know if you &apos;re up for it .  we only need six more people for a human pyramid .  .  . swoop !  !  swoop !  !  
you already hit on me an hour ago 
i don &apos;t get it neither ,  i mean you &apos;re obviously desperate ,  you &apos;re asking women how they want to be killed 
well .  .  .  
thank you so much for letting me do this .  public bathrooms freak me out ,  i can &apos;t even pee ,  let alone do anything else .  
its so amazing i met you the same day that eric broke up with me ,  because its like you lose a boyfriend ,  you get a boyfriend .  
no dont worry ,  this is not some rebound thing .  i am totally over eric .  
oh ,  hey !  hi ,  there you are ,  ive been looking for you everywhere !  
listen ,  my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o clock .  so i was hoping you and i could have a chance to kind of talk somebody here ?  
who ?  
youve being seeing someone ?  
what are you taking amoxicillin for ?  
ah ,  who is emma ?  
actually about an hour and a half .  
you feel that too ?  oh ,  i thought that was just me !  
hey ,  do you want to go away this weekend ?  
ok ,  ross ,  whats going on here ,  are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now ?  
how do you know about that ?  
emma .  
no ,  actually ,  see i had to pee ,  cause i cant use public bathrooms because the doodie parasites .  
well ,  call me !  
no ,  wait ,  you dont have my phone number !  
score .  
oh god ,  i cant believe youre making such a big deal about this .  it was one kiss ,  one guy ,  one time !  
yeah .  
oh yeah .  
what ?  who ?  
whoa ,  how do you know about that ?  
why didnt i get that message ?  
from the guy in the bar ,  why didnt i get that message ?  
ross ?  
why ?  
oh god .  you know what ?  who you think you are ?  who are you to decide what messages i should or should not get ?  
yes .  
oh my god ,  i cannot believe this .  you know i actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you about us !  but i cant do that with someone who hides my messages and brings crazy women back to my apartment !  
oh ,  ross ,  this is just so messed up !  whats wrong with us ?  you know when people hear about our situation they always ask ,  what ,  you live together but youre not a couple ?  and you have a baby ,  isnt that weird ?  and i say no .  you know what ,  its not ,  because it works for us !  but you know this doesnt work .  in fact this is the opposite of working !  
and you know ,  we said that we would ,  we would live together as long as this makes sense .  an maybe this ,  you know ,  just doesnt make sense anymore .  
hey ,  it &apos;s great having you back .  you know ,  stay as long as you want ,  and when does she stop crying all night ?   
bye !   
no ,  hey ,  it &apos;s been great .  
yeah .  and look ,  i just want you to know that with rachel staying here and everything ,  all my feelings from before are totally over ,  okay ?  and even if they weren &apos;t ,  when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump .  .  .  
wow !  so ,  how are you ?  
really ?  
well ,  actually it .  .  .  
wow ,  really ?  
sure ,  i know lots of girls .  
uh ,  there &apos;s a drunk chinese guy .  
can i get you another glass of wine ?  
got stood up ,  huh ?  
are you worried your date came ,  saw you ,  and left ?  
i &apos;ve got bad news .  the chinese guy left .  
look; you got stood up ,  who cares ?  we &apos;re gonna show you a good time .  just sit and relax .  in fact ,  let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on the house .  
ooh .  .  .   
just get out of here ,  okay ?  
eh ,  okay ,  the waiters have a little pool going .  we have a bet on how long it &apos;ll take before you give up and go home .  
well ,  if you stay till ,  i am .  
all right ,  well that &apos;s good to know .  good night ,  steve .   
i just had a rough night .  
eww !  
oh ,  well ,  i .  .  . it &apos;s kind of weird talking to you about this ,  but .  .  .  
yeah .  
oh .  
oh ,  oh no .  do you think she walked in ,  saw you and left ?  
well ,  if it makes you feel any better ,  i wish my date hadn &apos;t shown up .  
well ,  he makes t - shirts for a living ,  and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this .   
don &apos;t ,  don &apos;t do the plan - laugh .   
oh .  huh .  you know ,  it is weird that phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that joey set you up on a date that didn &apos;t even show .  
can you believe they &apos;re still not here ?  
right .  so ,  it &apos;ll be the same except less sex with you .   
 humiliating and noble !   
ross ,  you did not come up with  &quot; got milk ?  &quot;  
hey ,  do you wanna go to dinner tonight ?  
alright .  just give me your wallets and there won &apos;t be a problem .  
i have a gun  
no .  
ross ,  nice to meet you .   
ouh  
hey ,  hey !

you don &apos;t have to lie anymore ,  ross ,  i know that it was a fourteen year - old girl .  
yes ,  it was .  
  &quot; gimme your money ,  punk !  &quot;  
 yeah ,  and i &apos;m so ,  so sorry ,  ross ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  but ,  you know ,  if you think about it ,  it &apos;s kinda neat .   i mean ,  well ,  it &apos;s just that i i &apos;ve always felt kinda like an outsider ,  you know ,  the rest of you have these connections that go way back and ,  you know ,  now ,  you and i have have a great one !  
i know ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  please forgive me .  i don &apos;t know what to say 
really ?  even more humiliating than 
hey ,  ross !   i know you &apos;re still mad at me ,  but can i just talk to you for a second ?  
i just really wanted to apologize again and and also show you something i think you &apos;ll find very exciting .   
look ,  ross ,  in this box are all the things i got from mugging that i thought were too special to sell or smoke .   anyway ,  i was looking through it and i found  &quot; science boy &quot;   
i can &apos;t say ,  i just thought it was really good and maybe would be worth something some day .  
yeah but you should know ,  i also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here .  
you &apos;re welcome .  and thank you for  &quot; science boy &quot;  .  i learned a lot from him 
wow ,  that &apos;s a big cable bill !  huh ,  you don &apos;t have a job ,  but you have no problem ordering porn on a saturday afternoon ?  !   i was in the house !  
that she was the huge guy that mugged you ?  yah .  
yes dear .  
monica slow down !  ok ?  i &apos;m just excited to be living with him .  you know i mean ,  i don &apos;t know ,  can i see someday being married to mike ?  sure !  yeah .  y &apos;know .  . i can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way .  but do i want that house in connecticut .  .  . you know .  . near the good schools where mike and i can send sophie and mike junior .  .  oh my god i do .  
hi 
listen ,  i wanted to ask you something about marriage .  
no .  .  . i really wanted to know how you feel about it .  
mike doesn &apos;t ever wanna get married .  
never .  
i want to ,  but i just want you to tell me that marriage isn &apos;t really that big a deal .  you know that i won &apos;t ,  i won &apos;t be missing out on anything .  that marriage stinks !  
that &apos;s not how you really feel is it ?  
seriously ?  you divorce - o ?  
it &apos;s ok that &apos;s how you feel .  
i do love mike .  
yeah i guess you &apos;re right .  yeah thanks .  this helped .  thanks .  
it &apos;s not cooler .  
very cool .  
oh yeah you were helpful !  yeah ,  no ,  thanks you .  
what do you mean ?  
they are awfully boxy .  .  .  
uh huh .   
well !  we er .  . climbed up four flights of stairs ,  manueveored a narrow hallway ,  dodged a rabid pitbul .  .  .  but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky .  
hey !  ready to go ?  
what are you doin &apos; ?  
great ,  a faster way to tell people that i &apos;m unemployed and childless  .  
the tall girl who wouldn &apos;t sleep with you ?  
bet she &apos;d sleep with you now .  .  .  
let me see what you wrote about yourself two kids .  .  .   &quot;   you split with carol because you have different interests ?  .  .  .  i think you split with carol because you &apos;ve one very similar interest !  
hey !   
 no ,  no ,  no .  .  .  what do .  .  .  you can &apos;t do that to him !  
dude !   
damn it !  rookie mistake !   
i believe i read that somewhere !  
i respectfully disagree .  
who cares ?  nobody reads those things 
i don &apos;t have a page .  
oh ,  you &apos;ll see my friend .  there .  enter ross] 
 and so young .  
well ,  how you died was funny .  
it kills over one americans every year .  
you wanna talk about people &apos;s feelings ?  you should have heard how hurt professor stern was yesterday when i told him i wouldn &apos;t be able to go with him to key west !  
hey ,  ross ,  i just wanted to apologize .  .  .   .  . don &apos;t tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me ?  
huh !  so that &apos;s what i would look like if i worked out .  .  .  and was being serviced by a policeman .  you &apos;re not actually going to send these out are ya ?  
no ,  come on ,  you know that &apos;s not true .  
well ,  the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community .  
alright look ,  let &apos;s think about this ,  ok ,  do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time ?  that people are gonna post condolences on a website ?  this is not about people not caring that you &apos;re dead  . this is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief .  
right ,  i mean ,  come on ,  i &apos;m sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service ,  tons of people would come .  
ross ,  what &apos;re you .  .  .  what &apos;re you .  .  .  what are you doing ?  you &apos;re having a memorial service for yourself !  ?  
ross ,  don &apos;t press send ,  don &apos;t press se .  .  .   !  
there you go !  someone came !  
at least he died doing what he loved .  .  .  watching blimps  
some guy ,  tom gordon .  
ok !   
please ,  one ridiculous problem at a time !  
you gave them one day &apos;s notice ,  not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and monica .  .  .  it &apos;s probably the way you stand !  
oh ,  that &apos;s not true .  you had an impact on me ,  i mean ,  it &apos;s 15 years later and we &apos;re still best friends .  doesn &apos;t that count for something ?  
i thought so many times about calling him and asking him out .  i guess i really missed my chance .  
you sick freak ,  who does that ?  i can &apos;t believe i had a crush on you !   
yeah me too .  oh !  i have an idea .  why don &apos;t we all pitch in 50 bucks ,  we &apos;ll pool our money together and then if we win ,  we &apos;ll split it !  
you don &apos;t wanna win the lottery ?  
still on amelia earhart ?  
seriously ,  ross ,  you don &apos;t want in on this ?  
i like those odds !  
i &apos;ll ask .   boohaki ?  
that was a good day !   
i &apos;m parked in a garage on morton !  
so ,  did you come by to watch us win the big bucks ?  
don &apos;t touch the phone !  i &apos;ll get it ,  i &apos;ll get it ,  i &apos;ll get it !  !   
ooh !  tough odds !  
hey that reminds me ,  i thought we could use some extra luck so i brought a wishbone home from work .  
i won ,  hey !  
you know ,  ross ,  just keep making your jokes .  how are you gonna feel if we actually do win ?  
oh ,  i know ,  i know ,  the odds are against us ,  but somebody has to win ,  and it could be us !  and then how you gonna feel ?  you know ,  we &apos;re gonna be all like  &quot; oh everybody ,  let &apos;s take our helicopters up to the cape &quot;  and you &apos;re gonna be all like  &quot; oh ,  i can &apos;t guys ,  i &apos;ll meet you guys up there ,  i gotta gas up the hyundai &quot;  
i can see the headline now with regret eats own arm &quot;  .  
you know what ,  ross ?  i &apos;m gonna throw in 50 bucks for you .  
because i know that you think the lottery is  &quot; boohaki &quot;  but we &apos;re all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun .  and you &apos;re my brother ,  and i want you to be a part of this .  
ok ,  so now that you &apos;re in ,  what are you gonna do if we win ?  
seriously ,  that &apos;s your fantasy ?  to invest it ?  
you &apos;re right ,  it has been you dream for over 15 seconds .  
 i &apos;ll take this one too  uh  .  .  .  mommy ?  
i &apos;m hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word .  
oooh ,  i like that ,   &quot; daddy &quot;   
 oooh ,  is daddy getting angry ?  is daddy gonna spank me ?  
uh !  the psychic also said that i would be betrayed .  
hey ,  you just got in 5 minutes ago !  
yeah ,  i want my tickets too  !  and i &apos;m buying the knicks !  and steffi graff ,  ah ah !  
 ooooohhhhh !  
they &apos;re all in there !  even these five that i hid in my bra  .  .  .  
ok ,  good !   you guys were so scared !  there was no way i was gonna dump this .  .  .  oh god ,  no !   i think i broke your bowl .  
so ,  what ?  monica ,  we have the winning ticket !  my psychic said i was gonna win ,  remember ?  
 you know what ?  we should call my mum &apos;s house and say goodnight to emma before she goes down .  
 131 !   
i got that !  
we are on a roll ,  people !  !  
 isn &apos;t that amazing ?  
why - why aren &apos;t you more excited ?  
oh ,  but of course it is !  
i don &apos;t know all the words .  
i &apos;m just ,  i &apos;m just glad i didn &apos;t miss my daughter &apos;s first words  .  
yes you did ,  gleba is a word !  
ok .  .  .   &quot; emma just said gleba &quot;  !  
okay ,  okay ,  okay ,  fine ,  i &apos;m gonna look it up  .  
 alright ,  okay ,  okay ,  gleba ,  gleba .  .  .  fungi .

you don &apos;t think we should wait for him ?  
you know what ,  he &apos;s a big boy ,  i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll find us ,  ok ?  
on a cruise to the galapagos .  there was a sea food buffet you wouldn &apos;t believe .  there were clams ,  and mussels ,  and oysters ,  and cracked crab ,  and snow crab ,  and king crab .  it &apos;s a pity i &apos;m allergic to shellfish .  
 so ,  where did you get your undergraduate degree ?

please .  .  .  chandler is the love of my life .  .  .   .  .  .  oooh leather pants !  have mercy !    
actually ,  i &apos;m kinda happy to be leaving .  .  .  i just broke up with someeone .  
actually ,  alby is the guy i broke up with .  
yeah .  .  .  
yeah ,  well ,  he is a brilliant man .  
yes !  and while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend ,  he had a lot of issues .  .  .  
ok ,  you want the dirt ?  alby was seriously insecure .  i mean ,  he was really intimidated by the guy i dated before him .  
a guy who won two .  
yeah .  .  .  for three years .  
 .  .  .  no .  .  .  bu but there was my first boyfriend billy .  
no ,  but he did just win the mcarthur genius grant .  
how is it going with charlie ?  
oh ,  what &apos;s the matter ?  
i always loved that !  !  
worse ?  
 no .   
hey ross ,  this is one of my co - stars ,  dirk .   dirk ,  this is my good friend ross .   
hey !  so what show are you on ?  
hey ross ,  listen ,  dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together ,  or .  .  .  
hey ,  i got a 690 on my sats .  
 what have you got there ?  
hey ross !  so listen ,  about you and the dinosaur girl ,  are you really just gonna let a couple of nobel prizes scare you off ?  what is that ,  come on ,  a piece of paper ?  
go charlie !  but my point is ,  ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them .  maybe she &apos;s looking to ,  you know ,  slum it with some average joe phd .  
you &apos;re so much more than just brains !  you &apos;re sweet ,  and kind ,  and funny .  .  .  
ok well give her a chance to see all of that !  
good for you !  and hey ,  i thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the devonian era was top notch !  
no .   
 hey rach ,  have you seen charlie anywhere ?   
it &apos;s so weird ,  how did joey end up kissing charlie last night ?  i thought you &apos;d end up kissing charlie .  
i missed most of the party  charlie &apos;s a girl ,  right ?  
i don &apos;t know why joey had to kiss her !  i mean ,  of all the girls at the party ,  god !  
 be - cause ross is the father of my child !  you know .  .  .  and i .  .  .  want him to hook up with lots of women !   i just .  .  .  all i &apos;m saying is .  .  .  i don &apos;t think that joey and charlie have anything in common .  
all right ,  so .  .  .  ross ,  you &apos;re ok with all this ?  i mean .  .  .  
yeah ,  it &apos;s no big deal .  i mean ,  i just met her and i &apos;m fine with it .  .  .   
hi !  
oh ,  you know what ?  i &apos;ll come with you !  
 i feel like i owe you an explanation .  i don &apos;t ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties .  i &apos;m .  .  .  well ,  i &apos;m kind of embarrassed .  i really hope you don &apos;t think less of me .  
you know ,  actually i &apos;m a little surprised to myself .  i mean ,  joey is so different from the guys i usually date .  i mean ,  they &apos;re all professors ,  and intellectuals ,  and paleontologists mostly ,  you know ,  very cerebral .  .  .  
ross !  
i need to talk to you about charlie .  
yeah ,  i &apos;m .  .  .  i &apos;m kind of having a little problem .  
no ,  look ,  you know charlie ,  right ?  she &apos;s cool ,  she &apos;s funny ,  her body is soo .  .  .  
yes .  it &apos;s just that she &apos;s so much smarter than all the girls i &apos;ve ever dated !  combined !  i don &apos;t want her to think i &apos;m stupid !  
 eh ,  what do you know !  
right ,  right ,  right ,  well ,  she wants to go to all this cultural places and i don &apos;t know how to talk about that stuff .  you gotta help me out !  
please ,  c &apos;mon ,  you &apos;re the smartest person i know and i really like this girl ,  ok ,  i don &apos;t wanna lose her .  
thanks .  
the metsss !  
 oh ,  that &apos;s what she meant !   you know ,  if they &apos;re gonna shorten it ,  they should call it the muse !  you know ,  short for museum ,  and avoid all the confusion !  
ok ,  all right ,  so i &apos;ll take her to the met .  
geez ,  sounds like you should be going on this date !  
whoa ,  whoa ,  whoa !  slow down ,  you go way too fast .  ok ?  just go back to the met ,  ok ?  
you got to tell me exactly what to do there .  
 note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas .  monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself .  
(shaking his head as if to say says the words ,  my brain is thinking monster trucks !  
phonetically ?   
ok .  
ah !  i &apos;m an actor !  i can memorize anything !  last week on  &quot; days &quot;  i had to say  &quot; frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy &quot;  .  
no idea !  but the guy i said it to dies in the next scene so i guess it means  &quot; you &apos;re gonna get eaten by a bear &quot;  .  
ok ,  caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure .  touch it ,  it &apos;s really bumpy !   .  
come on !  you .  .  .   
haha !  got ya !  die ,  die ,  die !   
hi !  
the museum was amazing !  
not so much ,  no .  he had clearly memorized all the stuff to say ,  and some of it didn &apos;t even make any sense .  
well ,  for one ,  he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around .  
no ,  we went to the left .  
yeah ,  it &apos;s fun  .  
actually ,  you know ,  joey is your friend ,  and you don &apos;t really know me that well; it would be weird .  
well .  .  .  i &apos;m just thinking that maybe he &apos;s not the right guy to be with right now ,  maybe i should be with someone .  .  .  i have more in common with .  you know what i mean ?  
yeah ,  i guess that &apos;s true .  
he is very sweet .  plus he &apos;s hot !  
hey !  
 hey ross !  that art stuff worked ,  you hooked me up .  
not gonna find any clothes in there !  
hi .  
umh .  .  .  kurts baley ?  
so you &apos;re up for keynote speaker !  who &apos;s making the decisions ?  
he &apos;s a pretty tough guy to impress .  
oh .  .  .  you &apos;re not gonna do a magic trick ,  are ya ?  
 hey guys !  
i think i can safely say that we all have family issues ,  work stuff and / or are sick .  
not as much fun as last time .  apparently you only get porn if you &apos;re giving a sperm sample .  
 ah - ha !  
come on ross ,  be a good guy .  step up and do it !  
 what ?   
the data we are receiving from mri scans and dna testing of these fossils are  -  are staggering .  
 i mean ,  we &apos;ve been accepting leakey &apos;s dates as a given ,  but if they &apos;re off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can  -  you can just throw most of our assumptions ,  you know ,  right in the trash .   so - so what i am saying is  -  is is that  is that the repercussions could be huge !  i mean ,  not just in palaeontology ,  but if - if you think about it ,  in evolutionary biology ,  uh ,  genetics ,  geology ,  uh ,  i mean ,  truly the mind boggles !   
hello ?  
no .  no .  .  .  eh .  .  .  she went shopping with rachel .  why ?  what &apos;s up ?  
oh !  how &apos;s it going ?  
what !  ?  but i already bought my ticket to bermuda !  
fine ,  i &apos;ll rent a car and drive .  .  .  !  ross ,  you have to get that job !  
well ,  just wake him up !  
 
 hey !  i &apos;m all packed and ready to go !  
mmh - mmh .

i think david would probably wanna hear a few lectures .  
no ,  no ,  because ,  you know ,  he &apos;s been in minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight ,  he &apos;ll die .  
all right ,  let &apos;s do it !  5 hour flight with charlie ,  have a couple of drinks ,  get under that blanket and do what comes naturally .

you know ,  this happens all the time to my computer at work .  
well ,  i usually go .  .  .  play tetris on somebody else &apos;s computer .

ross &apos; office .  ross is pacing and benjamin enters] 
i &apos;ve come here to apologize .  i think i may have let my feelings for charlie interfere with the interview process .  
anyway ,  i &apos;ve decided to offer you the grant .  
well .  .  .  there is just one small .  .  .  stipulation .  .  .  
hey ,  you got one right !

central perk .  some time later that day .  the group has left and charlie is there when ross enters . ] 
did you get the grant ?  
what ?  
benji isn &apos;t in love with me .  i mean ,  he broke up with me .  and besides ,  he &apos;s a very ethical man .  
i &apos;m sure he was just joking ,  ross .  
seriously ?  
well ,  if it &apos;s like the lake mbosco in congo ,  then m - b - o .  .  .  
dr .  geller .  .  .  ?  charlie .  .  .  what are you .  .  .  what are you doing here ?  
like i tried to tell you in the interview ross ,  this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia .  
alright ,  it &apos;s true .  i behaved horribly .  but it &apos;s only because i still love you .  and i would do anything to have you back in my life .  
i never should have broken up with you .  i think about you all the time .  i mean ,  do you ever still think about me ?  
yes !  
i don &apos;t know what to say ,  benji .  this is all so .  .  .  .  romantic .  
maybe .  .  .  
i love you too !   
 
hey !  
that &apos;s funny ,  we were doing the same thing !  
it was pretty simple actually ,  i came up with a couple of cost - cutting solutions ,  wrote out a list and monica told me to go to hell .  
i heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry .  
i think it would make me wanna marry you even more .

hi !  emma will be up in a minute !  
oh hey ross .  .  .  listen ,  i heard about you and charlie .  i &apos;m really sorry .

yes ,  i was 4 years old and i was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain .  and to get me out my mom had to - had to cut a big chunk of my hair !   and it was uneven for weeks !  
ok ,  fine !  you can make fun of me .  i do not want emma going there .  and i was thinking claire danes .  
ross ,  those things go like 40 miles an hour !  ok ?  when you &apos;re .  .  .  and there is that moment when you are at the top ,  when you just don &apos;t know if you &apos;re gonna return back to earth !  
all right !

totally .  i had sex in high school .  .  .  
all right ,  i &apos;d say we make a pact .  neither of us will go out with missy goldberg .  
all right ,  so that &apos;s missy goldberg ,  phoebe cates and molly ringwald ,  who neither of us can go out with .  
oh ,  and sheena easton .  but we probably couldn &apos;t get her anyway .  
well ,  i officially give you permission to break the pact .  
your hands are shaking .

so how come it took you so long to ask me out ?

well ,  chandler and i used to make out !  a lot !  
yeah .  we &apos;d go to the science lab after hours !

ross ,  that was 16 years ago !  
i believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair .   all right ,  look ,  if we &apos;re really gonna do this .  .  .  it &apos;s not like you never broke one of the pacts .

i don &apos;t think they are .  
uh ,  for your information ,  since they hired a very hot weather girl .  
i guess .  
i &apos;m not scared .   i &apos;ll just take little chappy and .  .  .   he can sense my fear .  my throat is exposed .  
yeah ,  you &apos;d think i &apos;d give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway ?  uhh - uh .  .  .  
 i &apos;ll do it .  
geez ross ,  you could have showered .  
i love you too .

 ow .  i don &apos;t want him to wake up alone !  i should go to the hospital !

fyi .  .  
in the future ,  when a girl asks for some ill - advised sympathy sex .  .  .  just do it .   
 really ?  well ,  it seems to me if you &apos;d done the right thing ,  i would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed ,  i would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied !  
oh stop that !  
oh ,  really ,  well ross ,  you know what ?  i am a big girl .  i don &apos;t need someone telling me what is best for me .  
oh ,  really ,  really ?  well ,  it wasn &apos;t very good for me either .

oh ,  good .  
okay .  .  .  hey listen ,  just before you go i - i again ,  i just wanna say  &quot; thank you &quot;  for coming with me .  
and also ,  you know i uh ,  i was thinking about what you said ,  you know ,  about the whole sex thing and .  .  .  it &apos;s probably not a great idea to go down that road again .  
it &apos;s a shame though ,  i mean ,  when we did it ,  it was pretty good .  
hey uhm ,  do you remember that one really great time .  .  .  ?  
you know it was you &apos;re uhm .  .  .  birthday .  .  .  
well ,  i guess that &apos;s all in the past ,  now .  
 not even one more time ?  
no matter how much we want it .  
that &apos;s what we decided .  
 .  .  . it &apos;s kinda hard though !  
you know ,  when two people have a connection ,  you know ,  that &apos;s .  .  .  just seems like such a .  .  .  waste .  
 .  .  . ross ?  
just so you know .  .  .  with us .  .  .  it &apos;s never off the table .   
you mean that portuguese couple ?  yeah ,  like you wouldn &apos;t have done it .

oh god !  
 no ,  it &apos;s not that .  i got fired today .  and i didn &apos;t get the other job .  
oh !  
no ,  it &apos;s okay ,  you didn &apos;t know .  
 ross ,  what is taking you so long ?  
sure ,  sure .   what &apos;s with the chair .   
 nice to see you .  
 oh my god !  
ross !  that &apos;s mark .  from bloomingdales ?  you were insanely jealous of him .  
yes .  
oh .  
what ?  you don &apos;t want me to get a job ?  
ugh .

i guess .  why ?  who &apos;s she with ?  
it &apos;s seven years ago .   my time machine works !  
 hi you guys !  
oh ,  it was great .  mark is so sweet .  
oh ross ,  come on .  he &apos;s happily married .  his wife just had twins .  
that &apos;s great !  
i know ,  it &apos;s amazing .  it &apos;s amazing .  it &apos;s so much better than what i had at ralph lauren .  the money is great .  .  .  
he offered me one .  
oh ,  god !  please ,  somebody say something .  
i know ,  it &apos;s huge ,  and it &apos;s scary ,  and it &apos;s .  .  .  really far ,  far away from you guys ,  but this is such an incredible opportunity for me .  and i &apos;ve already talked to them about our situation with emma ,  and they said they &apos;ll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable .  
my boss said i might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle .   
thank you !  thank you !  
i see .  
i know ,  but what are we gonna do ?  she really needs this job .  
is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes ?  
you mean the guy who kept calling you ron ?  
may i help you ?  
oh right ,  uhm ,  don ?  
uh .  .  .  what can i do for you ?  
ah ,  did she ask you to come here and do this ?  
wow ,  that is tempting .  
she is good !  
but i &apos;m sorry .  there &apos;s nothing i can do .  .  .  ah ,  it &apos;s not true ,  there is .  .  .  nothing i want to do .  
yeah ,  his name is ross .   what ?  
yeah ,  they &apos;re all he talks about ,  why ?  
you can really arrange that ?  
well ,  i guess having rachel back wouldnt be the worst thing in the world .  
thats great .  i worry about little ross .  hes always reading ,  he &apos;s collecting rocks and hes obsessed with dinosaurs .  
hi .  
oh ,  well ,  shes asleep now .  stop forcing that thing on her .  
oh ,  youre not gonna believe what happened to me today !  ralph lauren called ,  and gave me my job back !  
yee .  i mean ,  it was so weirdest thing .  they fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back !  i mean ,  that place must have been falling apart without me .  
no ,  im still going .  
when the louis vuitton people found out that ralph lauren wanted me back ,  the offered me more money !  isnt that great ?  
this may surprise you ,  but re - hiring fired employees ,  is not my main job .  
 not good ,  ron .  
 wow ,  that &apos;s pretty cool  
okay ,  you got it .  
this is gonna make me very popular .  
 i meant with my son .  
hi !  
you are never going to believe what happened to me today .  
ralph lauren called again and they offered me more money .  
yeah .  it was the weirdest thing .  zelner called me and he said we &apos;ll do everything we can to get you back .  and that i should thank some ron .  .  .  i don &apos;t even know what department that guy &apos;s in .  
well ,  i took it .  
yay !  whoo !  yay !  
 ye - ah .  yeah !  you know ,  the money &apos;s great .  it &apos;s certainly the easier choice .  .  .  
yeah ,  you know ,  was i looking forward to going to paris ?  sure .  you know ,  was i excited about working in the fashion capital of the world ?  ooh ,  absolutely .  .  .  oh .  .  .  !  yeah ,  but you know ,  this is .  .  .  it &apos;s fine .  i &apos;m fine going back to a job where i &apos;ve pretty much gotten everything out of that i possibly can .  .  .   
well yeah ,  but i mean ,  it was good scared though ,  you know ?  like when i - moved - to - new - york scared .  or uhm ,  when i - found - out - i - was - gonna - have - emma scared .  .  .  but this is .  .  .  fine .  this is gonna be good .   
what ?  
you really think so ?  
but i already told zelner that i would come back .  .  .  
all right .  all right !  i &apos;m gonna do it .  i &apos;m gonna go to paris .  
yeah !  i &apos;m going to paris .  thank you ,  ross !  
oh !  oh ,  i &apos;m so happy .  
no ,  i don &apos;t mind you touching my belly ,  but right now your hand is kind of blocking the part where the baby is gonna come out .   
hi .  
that &apos;s because i &apos;m pregnant !  
oh ,  ok .  i &apos;m just always afraid that people think i &apos;m just fat with big breasts .  
no ,  no ,  i knew  .  staring at them .  
yeah ,  and i wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel .  
plus hotels are fun !  my room has this little fridge full of free snacks !  
ross !  she &apos;s giving us her baby .  she can eat you if she wants .  back .  
oh ,  i know .  i know .  hey ,  you know ,  you can take it if you want !  the lease is still in nana &apos;s name .  
yeah ,  it takes two incomes .  
oh ,  no .  he doesn &apos;t have time for that .  but if you want ,  you can go help him and joey pack up the guest room .  
all right ,  rachel &apos;s party is in a couple of hours and there &apos;s a lot to do .  now ,  ross ,  you got geller blood ,  you &apos;re in charge of these yahoos !  
hey !  handcuffs !  and fur line ,  nice !  i didn &apos;t know you guys had it in ya !  
why would she use them with richard and not me ?  i can be kinky !  i once did a naked dance for her .  .  .  with scarves !  
oh ,  he has a gig .  i kinda like being married to a rock star ,  you know .  my husband has a gig .  
oh ,  he &apos;s playing organ for a children &apos;s roller - skating party .  
hey .  
oh ,  she &apos;s putting emma down ,  she &apos;ll be over in a second .  
hey rach ,  hey you .  
come here ,  i &apos;ll make you a drink .  
i know ,  she &apos;s been such a big part of my life .  and it feels like when melrose place got cancelled .   i mean .  .  .  oh ,  forget it .  i miss melrose place !  chance to stop her too !  
you know what ?  uhm ,  i have some goodbye stuff that i wanted to say to each of you and i was gonna save it until the end of the night ,  but come here  .  
oh ,  you &apos;re so screwed .   
she &apos;s gonna say goodbye to each of us individually .  
yeah ,  i know ,  it &apos;s gonna be even worse for you .  .  .  god .  .  .  ross ,  get ready to do some serious crying .  
uh ,  rach ?  
 so ,  i guess you &apos;re next .  you &apos;re ready ?  
that old woman was being scammed by her mechanic .  
no ,  no ,  no ,  no !   
oh .  .  .   well .  .  .  
i think i &apos;m gonna take off .   
oh ,  you guys .  this was an amazing night .  thank you so much .  i love you .  good night .   
well ,  maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be ,  you know ,  implicit .  
all right ,  let &apos;s think about this .  i mean ,  there &apos;s got to be an explanation .  uh .  .  .  did you do anything to make her mad ?  
mine was a humdinger 
and say what ?   &quot; you owe me a goodbye &quot;  ,  i mean ,  he &apos;s got more pride than that .  
the hell i do !   
what ?  
ross .  .  .  
you really think i didn &apos;t say goodbye to you because i don &apos;t care ?  
i cannot believe that after ten years ,  you do not know one thing about me .  
because it is too damn hard ross .  i can &apos;t even begin to explain to you how much i &apos;m gonna miss you .  when i think about not seeing you every day ,  it makes me not want to go .  .  .  okay ,  so if you think that i didn &apos;t say goodbye to you because you don &apos;t mean as much to me as everybody else ,  you &apos;re wrong .  it &apos;s because you mean more to me .  so there ,  all right ,  there &apos;s your goodbye .  .  .  oh !  
what ?  
so if you think i didn &apos;t say goodbye to you because you don &apos;t mean as much to me as everybody else ,  you &apos;re wrong .  it &apos;s because you mean more to me .  
shh .  .  go back to sleep .  i have to go home .

ross ,  you &apos;ve got to tell her how you feel !  
you can &apos;t just give up !  is that what a dinosaur would do ?  
ross ,  rachel doesn &apos;t know that you wanna get back together .  if she did ,  she might feel differently .  she might not even go .  
hi !  so i just dropped emma off at my mom &apos;s .
